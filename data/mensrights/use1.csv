It deffo looks to me as though a lot of things that they believe are trivial or unimportant men's issues (like friend zoning or tinder failure) aren't really *men's issues.* They're just things they obviously hear lots of men complain about online. 

So you could look at it as a useful indicator that a lot of women don't really hate men but are just ignorant to men's genuine issues, because they see more from subs like r/niceguys, and r/creepyPMs, than from subs like r/MensRights",1616972073

35,MensRights,"I'm from the U.S. but it seems to me that that Green Party baroness was speaking hyperbolically in an effort to make people, men particularly, understand her point of view in the matter. It had been suggested that women stay home at night and this provoked many women who were already very upset about the incident. So she was apparently just banging on her drum. As gripped by wild feminist rhetoric as the U.K. sometimes seems to be from my admittedly limited outsiders' vantage point, surely there's no real threat of a male curfew moving forward.

That said, the rhetoric in the U.K. around the disappearance of that Sara Everard is just nuts. Your women are insane. Kate Middleton going to lay flowers seemed a bit much. Of course, we have mass shootings on the daily in my country so maybe crime is more shocking to the average Briton but if so-- doesn't that belie the claim that women aren't safe at night?",1616970627

Your second point doesn't make a stand because of my first point

For the third point, the woman gets a lot of leverage in bodily autonomy and cs from the ""father"" of the child. There are numerous cases where women are awarded huge amounts of money in family court and then go back to get even more money awarded to them. Family court is used as a weapon against men and that is partly because of how much leverage women have over the ""fathers"" finances because women are awarded primary custody more than men and just the bodily autonomy they have. If women can fully decide what happens to the fetus that is fine but men should get a say in when or not he wants to stay.
