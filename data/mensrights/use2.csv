1,MensRights,"Hey guys,

I just started a podcast to work on trying to struggle my way through some harder conversations, talking to friends and professionals who have different viewpoints than me. I feel like the tribalism and group think dynamics that social media is teaching us is killing the art of the conversation, so I wanted to work on getting better and speaking and listening for long periods of time--long enough periods of time that I could begin to genuinely get to know people and perspectives that I don't understand. That's the project of ""This Could Be Interesting"".

In this first episode, I took some time to talk to my friend Ken Paradis who's a lit professor at Laurier University in Brantford Ontario. He has a bunch of interesting things to say about religion, especially evangelicalism, and cultural identity. We took some time to sit down and talk through some of his ideas and ended up spending a lot of time trying to sort out the role of masculinity in the modern/postmodern/postpostmodern world.

If you make it through our fumbling around, let me know if you agree with any of the points we made. What does masculinity even mean? Is it defined by society, evolution, both, or neither? Does it have something to do with individuality? I don't know exactly, but I'm still working on trying to figure it out.",1613607040

""She's talking about men that are that way."" is an answer I often see under men-bashing posts. But the thing is, that's not true. They are talking about men, no ""omg racist men..."", just men.

16,MensRights,"This girl I dated for about two months one day stopped answering my messages when in friendship terms after the relationship. Stopped talking for a year and wondered if she was alright because of the pandemic. I sent a couple messages asking her in a span of 2 weeks without answer. Everything from a respectful place and even stated in every message that of she wanted me to stop texting her she should just say it and there would be no problem with it.
Received a 'trial' citation because of this incident where she accuses my of her rasing her for year and a half. Also talking about other girls I did the same to. I don't drink, get into fights, I'm not violent and have a really small social circle. Tried to get an exs testimony for my good behavior but she put sorority first, so she could not help me when the problem involved another woman.

20,MensRights,"Hi. I don't usually do things like this but It's 6:00 AM and I found something which made me so upset and angry and I feel like if I don't let this out I'll explode, this is difficult for me to talk about it, here's the video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGcCuULuPGI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGcCuULuPGI)

A few years back (when I was 20) a girl from my class used the defenetition sexual harrassment to get me kicked out of a college (It was from a FB message I didn't write and that I apologised for). She not only said this message was harassment but also fabricated things I didn't even say - this was as a revenge for a series of unrelated events between me and her - the principle (woman) and deputy principle (man) took me in (while I was accompanied by my dad) not only did they not ask or listen to my side of the story in any way, but the principle started screaming and shouting at me (and my dad) calling me ""underdeveloped"" and essentially making me out to be a sexual abuser, while the deputy principle just powertripped and said things to me to get effect. Even when my dad argued with them they didn't budge.

&amp;#x200B;

After this experience I left my country (Ireland, honestly for the better because this college wasn't benefitting me) I found myself feeling dirty and ashamed over having any kind of sexual thought, I had trouble even looking at an attractive woman (It made me feel weird, which hard to explain on here) It also made masturbation very difficult and my libido was continually getting lower (I'm getting over the experience but my libido is still very low) I also felt very humiliated and was unable to talk to my dad for a long time, I only recently addressed this with him last month, actually.

My problems with this video:

\-It makes incredibly angry when the media or people act as If men don't understand boundaries or how not to abuse women, as if they're animals with no morals. 

\-sexual harassment by defenition, even though it was and is still sometimes a legitmate problem, is way too vague and which can cause alot of problems (this is just my personal opinion) and this isn't new, It's actually been like this since the 90's

\-Women abuse and sexually harass men too, and this is continually ignored

\-alot of young men have issues with sexual shame, guilt, psychological problems etc and I really feel all this just backs these anxieties and problems up

I've been trying to avoid this stuff as much as possible as of late, but I just really slipped up tonight. I really hope this idea of men needing to learn consent ends eventually, but It's hard to tell. If I said something that might be considered offensive I do apologise, this just really had an effect on me and I had to let it out somehow.",1613542897

25,MensRights,"Found this in an article in a site called swaddle. It's from india and by their logic and reasoning men can't be victims of sexism. I can't comprehend this idea and do care to enlighten me.

"" Finally, feminism can’t be sexist towards men because of how oppression works. It has a unidirectional, systemic flow, from a group at the top that has social and cultural sanction to misuse power, toward the group at the bottom. Patriarchy hurts everyone — even men — but as long as men are in a greater position of social power that allows them to oppress women culturally, socially, legally and financially, they can’t be victims of sexism.""

28,MensRights,"So, it's just a little thing I'd like to share. 

I live in a post-soviet country, so it's already a bit depressing. But that's besides the point. What I want to talk about is the military. 

In my country if you're a man  from 16 to twenty something (don't remember it of the top my head) you get called for an examination (to determine if you're ""fit"" to serve) twice a year. And starting at 18 if you don't have a good reason not to join the army (I.e. chronic illnesses, broken bones, but that only helps for a time, being gay for just not straight also works here) you might just get enlisted against you will and send to peel potatoes god knows where. 

If you're not showing up, you can get fined and even jailed. 

Getting higher education helps, because if you prove that you're actually studying they'll stop bothering you for around 4 years. 

And it's not like the examination itself is any good. I can really find the words here, the best I can come up with is ""dehumanizing"". There isn't really a single part of the process that all that bad, it's just doctors who aren't interested in anything asking you things and checking if you really have these problems. But the part that just pisses me off is the last part, you just walk in a room alone with a doctor and he just goes over every health problem you claimed to have. And I get it, they're trying to figure out if you're just lying to get out of service. But the whole process is so god damn frustrating, because at every turn they just assume you're a piece of crap who never tells the truth and every proof you present is also crap. 

It's obvious that only men have to go through this. And, in my opinion, the whole process wouldn't be too bad if not for the societal pressure of it all. If you don't want to join the army most teachers (only in school) treat you like shit for not wanting to slave away a year of your life. I mean, my own dad didn't serve, he just worked in construction when he was in uni (in the USSR), yet he always says that I'm a wimp (or something like that. Language barrier and so on) for not wanting to work for free for a year. 

Quite a lot of people think that it's fine that a man has to either serve or he's not a man. 

There's always getting a contract, but it pays relatively little and lasts a minimum of 4 years. It is also almost impossible to get a contract, because the bar is set very high. But that's only for men.

Women have the bar set unbelievably low, plus they get a payed education guaranteed after service. 

Sorry for the rant, just needed to get it off my back. Also sorry for mistakes in grammar, second language and all.",1613470834

* Fathers are the butt of jokes more frequently in recent sitcoms than in the past.
* Fathers are shown in fewer parenting situations in more recent sitcoms.
* And when fathers were parenting, it was depicted as humorously foolish in just over 50% of the relevant scenes in the 2000s and 2010s, compared with 18% in the 1980s and 31% in the 1990s sitcoms.

39,MensRights,"I've been trawling through UN documents and in the lastest one, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women comes right out and states redistribution of power and resources to women is one of their goals.

The Committee makes recommendations to States. This one was about the application of 'temporary special measures' which are intended to make up for discrimination. 

Here are a couple of choice quotes which I found shocking.

**General recommendation No. 25: Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention (temporary special measures)**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;18. Measures taken under article 4, paragraph 1, by States parties should aim to accelerate the equal participation of women in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field. The Committee views the application of these measures not as an exception to the norm of nondiscrimination, but rather as an emphasis that temporary special measures are part of a necessary strategy by States parties directed towards the achievement of de facto or substantive equality of women with men in the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms. While the application of temporary special measures often remedies the effects of past discrimination against women, **the obligation of States parties under the Convention to improve the position of women to one of de facto or substantive equality with men exists irrespective of any proof of past discrimination.** The Committee considers that States parties that adopt and implement such measures under the Convention do not discriminate against men.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;39. Although the application of temporary special measures may not be possible under all the articles of the Convention, the Committee recommends that their adoption be considered whenever issues of accelerating access to equal participation, on the one hand, **and accelerating the redistribution of power and resources**, on the other hand, are involved as well as where it can be shown that these measures will be necessary and most appropriate under the circumstances.

72,MensRights,"I've been raising hell any time I encounter someone who uses the sexist and hateful slur ""mansplaining.""  I wrote a letter of complaint to the Mars Corporation over their use of the term in their Super Bowl ad.  There is no legitimate use of this word.  It's used to shut down discussion via shaming, and it implies that a man's explanation is automatically invalid based on gender alone.  Our society would never tolerate targeting other groups with this kind of word creation.  Imagine if a major company like Mars had used words like ""jewsplaining,"" ""blacksplaining,"" ""femsplaining,"" or even ""chinasplaining.""  There would be an uproar, and rightfully so.  So I wrote them back to let them know that's not acceptable.  

I've also complained on social media any time someone uses that bigoted word.  It's a word dreamed up by hateful feminists to denigrate men.  There is no legitimate use of it.  I've seen feminists claim it's needed to express the idea of a man explaining to a woman in a condescending way, but that's a cop out.  That's still stereotyping men as people who act that way.  Condescending speech has no gender.  We have non-gender-biased terms in English for expressing that idea.  

I've encountered people being very surprised that someone would object to this term.  They try to belittle me to shut me up by saying the same old cliches like ""fragile male ego,"" (which is another sexist and hateful term).  But I won't back down.  I've had it up to here with this bigoted term, and so I'm fighting back.  

I'm curious if any of my brothers out there have had similar experiences, and what you've done to fight back against this hate speech.  I won't stand for this hypocritical and sexist word being normalized.  There are other man-bashing / sexist terms, but this is the one that really disgusts me.  

If you've been fighting back as well, please let me hear from you.  But if you wish to write to try to justify this term of hate, please don't bother.  You should not try to justify misandry on a men's rights board.  You can go find some other forum where this type of hate speech is tolerated.

I'm a big puzzle enthusiast and love everything about them (*important*). Someone was arguing with me about how it's unfair that men and women don't compete against each other. I gave her not one but three examples and she told me that they don't count.

These are the examples:

1. There are competitions for Rubik's cube type twisty puzzles known as speed cube competitions. In those competitions, both guys and girls compete against each other to get the fastest time. There are many types of events for multiple puzzles. But most of the time, both guys and girls are competing against each other.
2. The same is the case with chess. Both men and women compete against each other. Yes, there might be events for women only or men only but it doesn't mean men and women don't compete against each other even in a professional competition.
3. Similarly, in the competition of Sudoku, both men and women compete against each other.

I'm sure there are a lot but these were the ones that came on top of my head.

Generally speaking, I may not know any competitions related to strength, but I know at least 3 competitions related to wits where men and women compete with each other.

Why is it that these examples don't count if they are not that famous or not related to strength?

No problem with the video, scrolled down to the comments. One guy said something along the lines of: ""You're good. They're ruining people's lives and you'll be helping people's lives"". One woman replied its the men who are ruining their lives. Ok. Another comment said women are profiting off of ""misogyny"".

First of all, women need to stop acting like these women doing OF are some morally upright women cause they're not. They're in love with money and see a chance to use their looks to profit off of LONELY, DESPERATE, DEPRESSED and traumatised addicted men. Cause that's most of the men buying OF, they wanna feel special, which is why they go with a single creator, but usually their lives are hell. Its the men's choice yeah, just as a drug addict goes to the dealer by their own choice, but these women are shallow.

They are essentially worsening their lives by providing for their addiction to sexual content. The horrible effects of p*rn and m*sturbation addiction, so no they're not completely out of blame or atleast they're not good people.

Its funny that women doing OF is ""empowering"" but the men paying are ""misogynistic"". Feminists love demonizing men for anything because they want to perceive men as evil. The men paying are lonely and need female attnetion, most likely depressed too. However, it's easier to disconnect from a person if you view them as subhuman so feminists will say that instead.

125,MensRights,"I came across a interesting fact recently. In a survey done by the CDC in 2010 ( the most recent gender-comparison survey by the CDC) , called the [National Intimate Partner and Sexual Abuse Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf), more men reported intimate partner domestic abuse then women. (I will be rounding to the thousand in this post for simplicity), 5,365,000 men reported it compared to 4,741,000 women. Now we already know women will victim blame men, so let me drop that right here. The difference between these two numbers is around  900,000, which would be 18% of intimate partner domestic abuse reported in this survey. Domestic abuse in gay relationships is thought to be about 2%, so let’s do the math. That would be 113,000 of the total 5,365,000 . So now we still have a 770,000 difference between both numbers and 5,252,000 cases left. Since we accounted for homosexual relationships, all of those 5,252,000 cases are women abusing men. Now to be fair, we will take the 2% (lesibian and gay relationship abuse is about the same) and subtract that from the 4,741,000. Now since the same amount was removed from both sides, we have a difference of 900,000 again and the numbers for women are now 4,622,000, all come by men. Now that we’ve accounted for homesexual relationships and covered all the statistical mumbo-jumbo, we can get to the interesting part. If men are abused so much more in relationships, then why are abusive relationships stereotyped as men abusing women, and women get more support in this aspect?   They twisted the narrative and told half the truth. As an major example of them getting more support, let’s talk about the good ol’ VAWA (or was it VAVA?) Basically, they use government money to support intimate domestic abuse shelters and such. But they have a large bias against men (mEn CaNt bE AbUsed, ThEy ArE StRoNgEr) and won’t fund men’s domestic abuse shelters, but will gladly give money to a women-only one. On top of that, this bias actually harms men in abusive relationships a lot. Not only are they usually turned down from most domestic abuse shelters, they are even arrested after they call the police for help because they assume “man stronger = man instigator”. Now why are people ignoring this? It’s because feminism told white lies and made /reinforced stereotypes of men being abusive. There’s basically this same attitude towards men being raped, but that’s a different story. And the worst thing about it is feminists always victim blame and say “well men are the ones doing it” (I already disproved that) and “it’s the patriarchy’s fault” (feminism slang for “some men were in power 50 years ago, so it’s mens fault for all this“) It may sound like I’m going a bit over the top here, but it’s just so hypocritical. Any suggestions/ comments? This is my first time making such a large post on such a large topic.",1613697172

&amp;#x200B;

How handsome he was, that man who did not court

the girls fawning all over him as if he’s already saved them,

it’s my leg, one said, raising her hem as she’d raised it 

in dreams

he knew of, for everything reached him as prayer, my leg, Sir,

is not perfect although as he looked, it glistened and the blood

became more productive. He did not date, nor rendezvous 

in tunnels and tents,

did not kiss except to heal, did not harass, malign 

nor mutilate;

threw no stones

&amp;#x200B;

and he was a man; never forget that he was a man,

&amp;#x200B;

that being a man improved him. Before the mothering. He was 

a solo act

ramming omnipotence down the throats of Ramses, Job, all 

the sinning nobodies

of Sodom. He was feared before he was born a triplet 

of flesh completing

the one vaporous, the other heavy and strict; now he’s 

desirable, vulnerable;

in the mother he visited stages of: fig, fish, pig, chicken, 

chimp before settling irrevocably

on a form more able to strive. This was a more significant 

time in darkness,

gestation of forty weeks, than three days in a hillside morgue; 

he learned maternal heartbeat

and circulation of her blood so well they became dependency,

and so he learned that some radiance is not his, hers

&amp;#x200B;

came in large part just from being Mary—how content she was 

even before pregnancy,

betrothed, blushing to ripen the fields; content even before she 

knew of angels,

and now, with this mound of baby, she was parent of a world 

whose prospering

she encouraged, activity of fish, magma, sulfur, the earth 

striving 

just as she did.

&amp;#x200B;

He was a man

yet the usher of miracles, preaching 

on a mountain

where reverberation gave him the power of five thousand 

tongues, yet not

a big man, not athletic, ordinary looking except for that glow 

and doves circling

him in the desert, doves that had been vultures earning their

transfiguration

by consuming decaying meat just as he ate all the sin; for that 

flattery, he bid them dip their

feathers in his eye, drawing into them that sweet milk around 

the iris.

&amp;#x200B;

He was a man

when he began to understand love, 

erasing the lines between

Gentile, Jew, and invited any who wanted to come to his father’s 

house for bottomless milk,

honey, ripe fruit, baskets of warm bread and eggs, wine, 

live angels singing. Weary revelers

could lay their heads on his breast, he said, needing intimacy; he 

thinks

as a man, therefore

&amp;#x200B;

he is a man

and good times, memories can be

adequate heaven. He knows the distance a man

is from his father, how likely it increases till the deathbed; 

he knows

what a man knows

&amp;#x200B;

the now and here, and can be called by name,

and can be wounded, and must struggle, and must be proud

every now and then or could not continue, must be worth 

something,

must be precious to himself and preferably to at least one other, 

must be,

in these thousands of post-Neanderthal years, improving, 

must have

more potential, becoming not only more like God, but more like

what God needs to become, so moves also,

so God moves also

because a man moves.",1613682010

Tl/dr im tired of being angry

So i want to dicuss and get some other info from other alienated fathers.   We all deal with emotions differently but i feel it always comes back to the same thing.   I feel angry/sad most days but recently more and more anger.   I feel like a complete and utter clown for paying my child support when i havent seen my daughter since her 1st birthday.   

I was adopted 2 times and found my biological family when i was 28.   Im angry because she is being deprived of 3 huge supporting and loving familys.   

My first adoptive mom got married 7 different times and put me thru so much because she had a tbing for abusive alcoholics.   I never wanted that for my daughter but all to my suprise i recently found out she is on step dad #9.   (Not sure if her mom married them all but she is calling him dad)   

I recently found out from my daughters best friend that my daughter has cut herself and refuses going to theraphy.   Im angry because legally and financially (family court is expensive) tied.   Im even more angry that her mom hasnt done anything to help her.  

Im angry because the majority of people who just dont care because they are either women or men not going thru it and refuse to beleive that it could easily happen to them.   

Im angry that i cant get the proper theraphy to help keep my anger and suscidal thoughts in check.   1. Because i cant afford it and cant even afford insurance to help cover it 2. There are no programs in my area to help men pay for theraphy (even though mens suscide rate being so high).

Growing up as a man with a female body I got to see the true side of womanhood. I can't say I stopped being a feminist after I begun to transition because I never was one. Even when the world viewed me as a woman I never agreed with modern day feminism and I never agreed in the saying that men were evil. 

Woman were always the ones who put me down. Tried to put me in these little boxes. Told me things like all men were rapists and that every time I leave the house I had a 25 percent chance to be kidnapped, raped, and murdered. And yet, all my best friends throughout my life have been males. They've never judged me, never put me down, nothing. Men have always been there for me when I needed it. Women? Not so much. 

As I've transitioned I realized that men actually had life hard. More expectations, harder work, shorter life span, having to hide emotions, always being shit on, etc. Yet I can honestly say that I enjoy being a man. I like myself, I have some dope ass dudes in my life and for the first time I have no female friends and my life is actually drama free.

204,MensRights,"I just got out of this mess happening and thought I needed to vent a bit to get this thing out of my mind and move on with the movie I was watching beforehand\*... So I, a 5’5 (165cm) engineering student, live in a condo (many houses enclosed by a wall) with my family for the time being during the pandemic. My brother was playing football in the courtyard when out of nowhere a dog comes running in his direction and grabs the ball out of his feet and proceeds to destroy the ball. We my family is pretty close to our neighbors, and the dog was not familiar (which directly led him to think it might have rabies, which is why we didn’t fight back). He get’s home, is very sad and irritated because it was his only birthday present for last year (of course no party thanks to COVID) and says the dog is still in the courtyard and is worried he may go after the balls that were still there from the younger kids from the other side of the street. My father, who has a history of very complicating diseases and if catches the virus is sure to be dead within the week, goes out to help me pick up the other balls and we proceed to lock the dog in the court to keep it from running away before we find it’s owner.  
 

Right after we do that, we hear one of our “what pandemic?” female neighbors who parties every week coming out calling the dog’s name and, obviously, does not have a mask on. I repeat 5 five times calling her to “put your mask on” as she hurries down the hill. She stops, no more than 30cm (1 foot) from my face when I tell her “will I have to hold you back?” and she replies with “If you touch me, I’ll call the cops on you!”. Nervous but level-minded as I could be, I reply with “No problem, now put on your mask”. She goes right back to her house, picks a mask, goes down the hill no problem and I even make sure to get at least 12 feet away from her. She picks up her dog, says we can put the destroyed ball on her mom’s check, and we both head back to our respective houses.  
 

Now, it is important to point out that this was only the second time I really interacted with this woman, and the first one was when we she threw a party right when I had just come back from São Paulo doing some volunteering at a hospital there (I’ll just say I could not last long there). It’s also very critical to point out that nobody is vaccinated yet, and she know my fathers medical history pretty well.  
 

A few minutes after we get back, this girl’s mother calls saying that her daughter was threatened by my, that I grabbed her and basically assaulted her. I would not be too worried in many circumstances, but the damn girl in a freaking lawyer with 3 month old baby (who did not deter her from partying like crazy, of course) and threatened to sue me for assault!  
 

And the worst part is, my parents are now shouting at me saying that I’m on my own and that the whole judicial system is geared against me, and if there are expenses I’ll have to find a job to pay it. All because I DID NOT WANT MY FATHER DEAD!  
 

I’m gonna be honest that I really want to move out and get on with in-person school as soon as I possibly can. Those friends who really know me know I could not hurt a damn bee if I wanted to (generally I just spend way too much time trying to get them to fly back through the window to safety 🐝) and now I’m scared to death because I now that just an accusation like that, regardless of court decision, could haut me for the rest of my life. According to my parents, she won’t bring charges or anything, but I should not be so scared for my life just because of standing my ground and telling her to put on a mask during a fucking once-in-a-hundred-years pandemic that, may I just remind you guys, has killed more Americans than the entirety of WWII!  
 

I’m just angry, scared, tired and just want to get back to working on telescopes and spacecraft like I was a year ago...  
 

If you guys have any advice, I would greatly appreciate it. I’m just a young person and have never felt so scared of having been born with the wrong bits down there... If it helps, I’m based on the southernmost state of Brazil.

Second of all, most of the posts on this subreddit make me more aware of problems, but  the comments blame women and generalize women as if all women do this

People act like some men don't contribute to hurtful comments about men

 ""You can't be abused by a woman""

""You can't be raped by a woman""
""You're gay if you paint your nails""


A lot of people in this world have old views on how the sexes should act, women should clean or whatever, men should do physical work whatever

But both women and MEN can contribute to these, telling young boys they shouldn't cry or express their emotions isn't good, it was mostly the women in my life that told me I shouldn't play soccer because it isn't ""ladylike""

The men's rights movement was an inevitable and required pushback against feminism. No ideology should be allowed to run unchecked.

 Think Nazi Germany and North Korea. 

A pushback is necessary to keep them from having absolute power or disaster ensues.

From a feminists perspective, feminism was the inevitable and required pushback to the ""patriarchy"" (I despise that term btw). 

Feminism wants to quash the patriarchy. 
I think that is pretty standard methodology for all feminism. Even though the patriarchy doesn't exist but that's besides the point.

Did they expect that society would just give into all their demands without question?

That's where the MRM comes into play.

Men's Liberation lol.
This is a feminist construct to make it look like feminism is good for men. It isn't.

Feminism isn't going to ""liberate"" men.

Look at what feminism has done to due process and innocent until proven guilty. Two of the pillars of modern democracy and the legal system.



No. There is a response to every ideology.  There has to be. And the MRM is the required response. Not Men's Liberation.

I would think that with (western) Europe sharing cultural elements, that the extremist ideology in the US would have spread there somehow. Can someone from the EU tell me whether you think your country favors men or women, or do you feel it’s equal? Thanks in advance.",1613840280
239,MensRights,"I recently made a post on r/memes detailing incidents I had experienced on snapchat whereby young girls anonymously sent me snap saying “hey, me and my friend here” and I would reply with hi/hello, etc and the conversation would get to a point where they ask me my age. When I tell them my age, they would say stuff like “you’re weird, disgusting, creep, pedo, etc” instead of removing me from their contacts. This is statutory abuse and I made a meme to express the hypocrisy of the situation when I am constantly compared to 40 year old celebrities. “oh, the hemsworth bros are still single.” Well I guess you’re not with them because they don’t want arrogant people like you. 

I use snapchat to engage in nice conversations with everyone and am expected to “be the adult” even when chatting with adult females who say things like “i don’t want anything sexual, i have a boyfriend.” I am now assumed to be a sexual predator because I am a male snapchat user?

That was not a nice chat to make with someone. I shouldn’t have to delete your mess for you.",1613839252

285,MensRights,"So there is this ~7 year old movie made by Disney. You can see it on Disney plus and it has been featured and recommended several times. It is called Zapped. So here is the plot of the movie:

Girl has a dog that doesn’t listen to her, so she decided to download an app that talks to the dog for her. Her phone then got damaged in water and was luckily salvaged. Later on, the app doesn’t work but for some reason all the “disgusting” boys were all listening to her. She later finds out it is because of the app, and her reasoning behind this is that boys act relatively similar to dogs. Already EXTREMELY sexist. The app does not work on girls, but if you were born a male, it works on you. This bothered me SO much as this was what the entire movie was based off of. Not only that, but she yells at the boy she has a crush on to kiss her when he was being reluctant, and he did of course. This was... I just have no words.

So I had a friend who got falsely accused of rape. And I’ve been thinking of this, almost problem for a while but, can you ever, completely prove one received consent. 

It just seems like almost anything can be said to vitiate consent at any time. But to me more accurate this is my example in words.

Let’s say this guy does it all. He asks the girl for verbal consent before he starts, periodically he checks up on her to make sure the consent is still ongoing. The girl is completely sober. Etc etc. 

Then she goes and claims rape. And her argument is yes I consented, but I only did it out of fear as the man is a 6 ft 9, 250lb African-American varsity athlete. 

Can one even argue against that. The only argument I even see that could go against that would be arguing that one is not a physical threat. And that seems impossible given the stats",1613961784

378,MensRights,"Hi, so this is kinda a story/ analysis of the stuff that made me an MRA and my experiences with sexism.

Let’s start from the beginning. During my childhood my mother was emotionally manipulative and abusive towards me, my sister and her husband. As a kid, I always felt like home was a potential war zone, as we never knew when she was going to snap and start yelling and emotionally abusing us. I never really had any connections as a kid and felt all alone. 

During my early school years, I found it hard to make friends and was often sad. I tended to be reserved and ungodly quiet. It didn’t help that much of the trauma from at home stuck with me throughout most of the day. I would sometimes try to tell my teachers about how I didn’t like seeing my mother so upset at my father (she primarily yelled at him but would also yell at me an my sister from time to time), and they would just say that that’s what all parents do.

During my later years of school I did eventually make friends and opened up a bit more to others. My mother still berated me and my family during this time. During my middle school years and elementary school years I always felt inferior to the teachers (who were primarily female) as well as the girls in my grade. I think it was mostly due to my situation with my mother at home. It still didn’t help with my self esteem.

During high school, I transferred school systems and I was back at having zero friends. I was shy as usual and felt like an outsider. During this time, the modern wave of feminism was starting to creep in, as well as the 2016 election. During high school, many of the male degradation campaigns started to creep into the high school and lectures. Also I was online a bit more and more of the things about how men are unable to know what pain is or are inherently inferior.

This is where some of my MRA attitudes came into play. I knew that being treated as a lesser being was not right and I would not bow down to the women who were “constantly being oppressed and unable to be mean or abusive” because I knew dang well that was a lie. I had seen and felt firsthand how women could be abusive and that men had their own set of problems just like them.

During college is when it really took off. I started college in 2018, and this is when stuff was really getting out of hand for radical feminism and anti male propaganda. While I (thankfully) was never accused of assaulting or raping anyone, it still didn’t mean that my experience was positive. During freshman orientation, we were given a speech on sexual assault and rape. Not once did they mention men being victims. It also didn’t help that I was very sexually inexperienced at this time, unlike everyone else, I didn’t have a girlfriend or boyfriend since high school or right before college, so some of the stuff they were saying about sexual assault and rape was new to me. It was infuriating hearing a bunch of girls snarking on how anyone who hadn’t heard of the stuff they were talking about was an idiot.

There was another talk less than a month later and it was similar in the fact that there was zero sympathy for men and zero mention of male victims. As time wore on in college, things kept getting worse, with the university pushing for more female oriented talks about violence and sympathy. It worsened my already bad anxiety and depression. My two trips to the mental hospital didn’t help either and I received little sympathy.

Anyways, all this showed me that the modern  world did not care for the problems that men had. It made me (and many on this sub) feel like lesser people. I do not hate women in the slightest, and I don’t blame them for everything wrong in my life. In fact, I support women’s rights and wish them the best in life. However, I have no sympathy for misandrists and the ignorance of male suffering and demonizing of men as a whole.

TLDR: Grew up with an abusive mother and school system that downplayed my experiences at home lead to severe depression and a rejection of modern anti male propaganda and modern feminism.",1613931170

My argument centered around behavioral differences and I made the point that, on average, men are more aggressive and interested in things, and women are more agreeable and interested in people, but there is more behavioral variance within each group then between. This is why you see the most violent humans skew heavily male. 

She blamed all differences on externally driven forces like societal norms and felt male behavior is a result of how they are raised, and what they are told they should be like, rather than biologically driven forces. 

I’m looking for more examples to prove my point that the majority of male/female behavior is driven by biological forces. One thing I remembered was car insurance is more expensive for men than women. But that that could still be explained away by “external forces”",1613909846

TM makes a human into an /other/ a them and us mentality. Leaving little room for the subject to improve. We’re all connected in a way so let’s all take ownership of ‘why’ someone might have TM. Constructed says something about society’s part. Constructed too because we don’t let little boys feel and develop their emotional intelligence instead leaving them the only acceptable expression of anger/frustration. Both genders foster this emotional castration... so for me it’s constructed.

466,MensRights,"I'm sick and tired of this attitude.  First, marriage puts massive demands on a man.  Feminism has demanded that women be released from their gender roles, but men are still expected to adhere to theirs, and more so than ever.  You're expected to be a great provider by making lots of money.  Then, if you do, and you get married, any quick no-fault divorce can swipe half of that wealth away from you, plus possibly alimony and child support.  For a man, marriage is a great way to become financially destitute.  So then if a man makes the rational decision to not participate in marriage, society looks at him as some kind of creep.  Who's life is it anyway?  You can either get married and have those huge demands put on you and likely be destroyed financially and emotionally or you can opt out and receive a heaping helping of social stigma, as unmarried men are constantly suspected of being up to no good.  If you even look at someone the wrong way, you're assumed to be some kind of child molester.  

I'm so tired of all this crap, I'd rather live alone in a cabin in the woods and spend my days reading or canoeing on the nearby lake.  Maybe I could write some stories on a manual typewriter.  But being stuck in corporate America and simply expected to earn a lot and support a woman -- that sucks.  I'm sick of it.

481,MensRights,"Currently, I'm a 17-year-old guy and am in a much better place than I used to be when I was falsely accused of rape and sexually assaulting this girl in school, and thankfully things didn't get out of hand for me during the whole situation, and I got away from it relatively quickly...

So this story occurred 2 and a half years ago when I was in school... I was always the quiet kid in school unless I was around people I was very comfortable with, I was an above-average but not a superb student, I was in the school band and in the school table tennis team (and most of the band members were a part of the table tennis team, we were almost always together) and represented my school till the state level once...

I was a pretty reputed student around the school and was considered as one of the nice kids who were kind, always submitted homework before time, worked hard in school projects and, most of the teachers (who didn't teach me as well) knew me pretty well... I wasn't socially great but still recognized well throughout the school...

So in 9th grade, a week after the midterm examination we were having a PE lecture after which we had our recess, I spent all of that time (one hour for PE and 30 minutes in recess) with my friends, all of us played table tennis together and then ate our lunch together (in the class, our class teacher was in the class as well), right after the recess during lectures I was called by one of the peons saying that I was called by the principal...

I've never been called by the principal outside of a couple of situations where they called me and my table tennis team just to talk and congratulate us for doing well, but I've never been called alone... so I was a bit confused... while going to the principal's office the peon gave me many weird/disgusted looks which I didn't know why he did so at the time...

I enter the principal's office to see a girl crying with her hands over her face (I don't recognize her) and the principal looking at me with a VERY angry look... I ask what's going on she tells me to shut up, and said ""what you did is completely disgusting, you don't deserve to be on this school premises and I am considering suspending you for this"" which really caught me off guard cuz she's never spoken to me like that before... I ask again what happened and she tells me in a very condescending manner ""oh so you don't know what you did just a few minutes ago?"" to which I replied that I was eating food with my friends in class...

and then she asks the girl to tell everyone her story again...

(Back story of the girl: she's a student from the other class and she's one of the entitled girls who wasn't that super popular but still had many friends, she apparently had a crush on me, and she asked me out a few weeks before the midterm exams to which I rejected her very respectfully telling her that I wasn't looking for any form of relationship, nor am I interested in dating anyone and it was nothing against her)

her story mentioned that during PE class I went to the 5th floor where she was, and while she was going to the washroom I followed her and went into the washroom right behind her, and also then manage to keep her quiet with my hands, pull down my pants and rape her for 10 minutes and then leave her in the washroom floor and back to where ever I was...

and I was devastated on listening to the story cuz I've never even thought of doing this to ANY woman I know (or even not know) and I would never wish it upon anyone ever... I immediately started stuttering and struggling to speak cuz I was still trying to interpret what she said, I kept trying to say that I was with my friends the whole time, struggling to say anything and mumbling most of the things, almost on the verge of tears, the principal then threatens to call my parents and I get very scared cuz they're very abusive to me, and I don't know what they would do to me even after I was proven innocent, I kept repeating that I was with my friends the whole time to which then the principal  said ""okay then, call your friends, I want to hear from them, and I'll be checking CCTV footage of where you were"", my friends were called and the principal had the footage of my class, the 5th-floor corridor and the table tennis room pulled out cuz those were the places I either was or claimed to have been there (I was in the table tennis room during PE and in my classroom during recess) I was playing table tennis with my friends during the time period the girl specified and my friends also testified for the fact that I was with them the whole time, and even my class teacher was called and she testified for me too...

it was clearly visible that I was innocent and that I didn't do anything remotely close to what she said, and then the girl says that all my friends were in on it, my teacher was in on it too, and started saying more and more lies and tries to maneuver her way out of the situation...

my friends and I were told to leave the room and we did so too... I couldn't sleep for a couple of days after that cuz I was so scared because of the whole situation and thought that I would be treated like a rapist, put in jail, thrown out from my school, my parents would disown me, and a lot of other thoughts... a couple of weeks later after the whole situation I'm told that I've been removed from the table tennis team and won't be allowed to represent my school in any form of competition ever again, I was also removed from the school band, the girl was told almost nothing other than the fact that she had to go through an hour or so long lecture from the principal, she still told her lies to all of her friends and many other teachers, even though I had proved my innocence within mere minutes of being accused I was treated like a criminal in school, my friends spoke to me less as well cuz they didn't want to be painted as a ""rapist's friend"" (and I don't blame em for that) I got bullied a whole lot more than I used to be, my teachers would be more sarcastic towards me, everyone gave me the looks and made the last year and a half of school a living hell for me... thankfully these topics were never brought up to my parents in any way, and my teachers didn't bring it up to my parents during the parent teacher meetings though they were passive aggressive during em overall...

it was a really rough time for me cuz I was treated like an outcast, it made me go into depression and get into self-harm telling myself that I was actually a rapist, beating myself up for rejecting the girl, even having suicidal thoughts, and considering that life just wasn't of any use anymore, everyone would treat me like this even after school was done... it made me miserable...

but I'm glad I hang on to dear life then... after school was over everything was a lot better for me... since the whole situation never got out of the school (cuz the school didn't share it, basically shut it down to keep their own reputation high as well) and since I've gotten into college I've gotten away from the whole story and it isn't a tag attached to me anymore... nowadays I always keep my distance from all the women I know, surrounding myself with people who could testify for me, staying around CCTV cameras at all times so that I can prove my location at any time... and I really suggest you all do so too... never having girls as friends ever again...

I was reminded of this story today cuz of a nightmare I had with a very similar story... and just wanted to vent about it and also spread awareness that just stay away from women and surround yourself with trustable people...

&gt;Note: I won't be sharing the names of the girl, principal, peon/teachers, myself, or my school in the comments or anywhere to maintain my own privacy, you all are completely in your right to doubt or question this story in any way because you should never trust a random story completely and always have an ideology of innocent till proven guilty... these concepts go both ways... I'm not in a court battle to give any revealing information about myself to anyone here...",1614083654

Along with many other getting busier in their life I no longer participate but I still hang out with them and sometimes we discuss/watch professional players.

One day, there was an outrage about a player accused to have raped a underaged boy. I know this sub often discuss about woman falsely accusing men. But lets say underage boy get a similar privilege too. Many in my social circle were mad and started to insult the player.

I said, while the justice system isn't perfect (because they somehow believe the system favor raper and men), the community doesn't have the competence to judge the guiltness and do self-justice, especially with so many grey areas. The pressure will push Corporations in which the players is affiliate to punish him and ruin his career.

I got plenty of immature reactions, insult, projection and reinterpretation of my words to debunk what I never said. Some stayed silent and some tried their best to be civil holding themselves. I was alone and a little afraid to speak up but I had to it.

So the player got banned of pretty much everything and lost most of his followers and subscribers as expected.

Many months later, we learn after a lot of procedure, he proved himself to be innocent with the ""victim"" public apologize.

People were like ""oh, ok."" Back to their everyday life with no second thought. That made me mad they didn't learn anything so I called out their hypocrisy. Giving themselves the right to judge, contribute to the movement that ruined his life and do as if nothing happened because they have no consequences.

I was afraid, especially considering their reaction last time, but I had to do it. But surprisingly, all the people that were silent people took my side and all the non extremist admitted their mistake. And the one extremist was seen as a dick.

That relieved me. They're not all my friends, but friends of friends, we're a big group. It's hard to get along with everyone and if I were to kick of my life everyone with different opinions, I'd have barely any social life. So I'm glad that I at least changed the mind of my groups.",1614054307

I got pounced on and called monstrous and kicked from the gc and blasted on everyone's page. They used semantics to take my words and twist them to suit there fashion. They proceeded to call me a rapist and blast me on twitter claiming that I thought rape was funny. I tried to explain myself and threw a couple of jabs back and that was that. 

All of the girls in the group are feminists and so were the creators of the poem. The poem said that all men like to listen to rape stories for ""porn"" and they use the phrase ""men get raped too."" as a way to silence women. I found it funny because I have a weird sense of humor and saw it as mocking the sexism in the video. I believe that as a young man, turning 17 in a two of months, that the fact that I am a man, should give me a voice and not be silenced and shamed for being different.",1614284680

Now technically the United Kingdom is led by a woman, but when I checked the guardian article ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/18/female-led-countries-handled-coronavirus-better-study-jacinda-ardern-angela-merkel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/18/female-led-countries-handled-coronavirus-better-study-jacinda-ardern-angela-merkel)) asking whether women led countries were better at responding to covid (one can argue that a vaccine is a response), they included the Britain and Ireland as a male led country.  Since you can't have it both ways and I know Scotland is female led, I'm leaving the UK out..  That leaves only Denmark as a female led country in the top 10 and just barely ahead of Switzerland and Turkey.

Now lets talk about the gender of the leaders who's countries actually created a vaccine.  Just off the top of my head, I think they're all male.  Yay for toxic masculinity.

The title says it all really but what I will add is that the article, as usual, does a horrendous job of creating a balanced response and there is no detailing specifics. If there is more to the article that actually would give reasons why she deserves paying it is not mentioned. The fact that she has done housework seems to be the only case they bring up for her validity of payment. 

It also says that the case sparked heated debate online but then goes on to only list 3 examples of the same argument that she should have been paid:

""Some social media users pointed out that 50,000 yuan for five years' of work was too little. ""I'm a bit speechless, the work of a full-time housewife is being underestimated. In Beijing, hiring a nanny for a year costs more than 50,000 yuan,"" said one commenter.

Others pointed out that men should assume more household duties in the first place.

Some also called on women to continue pursuing their careers after marriage. ""Ladies, remember to always be independent. Don't give up work after marriage, give yourself your own way out,"" 

There is no mention from the other side of the coin that would suggest maybe 4 hours of cleaning and child care per day is not unreasonable in comparison to a full time job (again the article does a terrible job at pointing out specifics but if we are to assume it is a typical traditional household then let's assume, until told otherwise, he brought home the money from work and she was working as a house wife).

Is that not a classic template of what one form of a relationship is? Sure I'm very supportive of the idea that she could have gone to work for the equal amount of time that her husband works and they find an arrangement between them to evenly do the housework and childcare. But that doesn't seem to be the arrangement here. As far as I can tell, he worked in 'the office' she worked at home. Fair deal. 

But now women want paying for that job!? Are women now saying they want to be employees of their husbands? Doesn't seem very liberating to suddenly have your husband as your boss. And as for the husband's. Might as well ditch your wives and hire a cleaner!",1614215212

Also I've always found this argument to be incredibly hypocritical , since most villians and grunts in most movies are males , so are movies anti-male now?

No , its just a movie and even though most villians are men , why does that matter? Them being men isn't the reason they'rebad.

Also the basis of the argument is that women become anorexic or something?

Which is an incredible fat lie , as women now , are as fat as the average man in 1960 America ( 75 Kg! ) and are 18.5% heavier than their counterparts in 1960 ( 63 Kg was the average weight of a woman in 1960 America ) .

So this whole oversexualisation argument is just stupid , hypocritical and downright a lie , considering how action heroes looked like in the 80's.

Whlie the storys of the women were haunting and truly horrific, I'm sad there were no male victims present. I qulickly looked up the statistics on domestic violense in Germany, and at least 20% of the victims are male. Though that does seem very low compared to other rich countries like the UK und USA.

&amp;#x200B;

This LinkedIn study from 2019 used their internal data to examine differences between men and women when job searching. Among the key findings are the fact that men and women view a similar number of jobs though women apply to 20% fewer. A recruiter is 13% more likely to view a man's profile which she described as result of a problematic bias that must be corrected (even though they also found that recruiters will still contact both genders at equal rates).

However, the author (Maria Ignatova) makes no effort to hide her own bias (and sexism) by writing:

&gt;The good news is that when women do apply to a job, they are 16% more likely than men to get hired. In fact, if the role is more senior than their current position, that number goes up to 18%.  
&gt;  
&gt;While this is an uplifting stat, it does show that women do a very thorough job at vetting roles — sometimes maybe too thorough. If women only apply when they feel extremely qualified, this could also indicate they are not pursuing stretch opportunities.

Linkedin is a mainstream website, not a fringe feminist blog. Yet blatant discrimination in hiring practices is celebrated as ""good news"" and as ""uplifting stat(s)"". This doesn't lead to equality, it's just another piece of evidence that equality isn't the actual goal.

Her analysis is also very weak and uses the usual strategy of reframing all issues so that women are the real victims. I think a more plausible hypothesis for why men apply to 20% more jobs is because if we are getting rejected more often then we need to submit more applications to increase our chances of finding work. Of course I would submit fewer if I was getting offers at 16-18% higher rate.

For most of us, this is just seeing statistics that support what we already knew is happening. The worst part is just being gaslit, and told this is ""equality"" and if we have a problem with it we are misogynist or examples of ""toxic masculinity"". I just wonder how far it will continue to go.",1614422284

* “...federal and state laws criminalizing genital alteration on female minors are so broad that they cover even procedures **significantly less substantial** than newborn male circumcision.”
* “...a complete laissez-faire attitude toward one practice coupled with total criminalization of the other, runs afoul of the **‘free exercise’** clause of the First Amendment. There are also troubling implications for the constitutional requirement of **equal protection** because the laws appear to protect little girls, but not little boys, from religious and culturally motivated surgery.""

[Arora et al. 2016](https://jme.bmj.com/content/42/3/148) wrote in a paper published in *The British Journal of Medical Ethics*:

* “Male circumcision is legal in USA and tolerated in most of the world, even when done by non-medical practitioners in the home. Yet comparable or less radical procedures in women are deemed misogynistic and human rights violations.”
* “..the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics as well as WHO have labelled all forms of FGA as a human rights violation as it violates ‘bodily integrity in the absence of any medical benefit’ and victimises vulnerable girls. However, male circumcision is also a procedure that violates bodily integrity and up to recently was thought not to have justifiable medical benefit—but was instead tolerated due to religious and cultural freedom and the lack of long-term harm.”

[Earp 2020](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341965054_Why_Was_the_US_Ban_on_Female_Genital_Mutilation_Ruled_Unconstitutional_and_What_Does_This_Have_to_Do_With_Male_Circumcision) also noted:

* “There are now legally prohibited forms of medically unnecessary female genital cutting—including the so-called ritual nick—that are **less severe** than permitted forms of medically unnecessary male and intersex genital cutting.""

He also writes about the differences in 'khatna,' which is the genital cutting procedures practiced for both sexes in Islam. The male procedure is more severe and yet completely legal, whereas the female procedure is criminal in all 50 states and treated as a 'mutilation.'

* “The Bohras practice what they call “khatna” – an Arabic word for circumcision – on both girls and boys within their community...In the female case, “a pinch of skin” is typically cut or removed from the clitoral hood, often leaving no visible sign of alteration. In the male case, the entire penile foreskin is removed, leaving an unmistakably altered sexual organ. According to the ruling by Friedman discussed in the previous section, the less severe female procedure is already illegal in all 50 states—as a criminal assault. It might seem, then, that the more severe male procedure must also be a criminal assault. In fact, that has been a dominant view among legal scholars who have addressed the issue since 1984. However, the male procedure continues to be treated as legal regardless of jurisdiction, including in its more dangerous forms.”

The double standards don't stop there. There is a procedure that ultra-Orthodox Jews perform called 'metzizah b'peh' which is an ancient, unhygienic form of male circumcision where the “mohel” (traditional circumciser) tears the immature foreskin from the penile glans, typically without pain control, and then takes the baby’s penis into his mouth to staunch the blood and supposedly “cleanse” the wound. This has been known to have caused many cases of herpes and led to two cases of serious brain damage and two deaths in one year alone. Not only is this practice not treated as illegal—it isn’t even regulated. City officials ultimately dropped even an informal plan to require that parents sign a consent [form](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/nyregion/new-york-city-health-board-repeals-rule-on-consent-forms-for-circumcision-ritual.html).

However, any forms of female genital cutting, including ones done in sterilized and anesthetized manners are seen as illegal and criminal, **full stop**.

Now, some might respond with something to the degree of: ""Circumcision has health benefits whereas FGM has none.""

Well, the question I would ask is: ""If it was demonstrated that FGM had health benefits, would you concede your position that it is a moral wrong?"" Presumably not, and this is merely a moral red herring. If so, then you might have to be prepared to give up your view, as some health benefits have also been noted for FGM in many scholarly sources.

For example, there has been found: ""a lower risk of vaginal cancer … fewer infections from microbes gathering under the hood of the clitoris, and protection against herpes and genital ulcers.” - [Source 1](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1525/maq.2007.21.3.301), [Source 2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276160197_Female_genital_mutilation_and_male_circumcision_toward_an_autonomy-based_ethical_framework)

Moreover, at least [two studies](http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=iph_theses) by Western scientists [have shown](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265824402_Female_Circumcision_and_HIV_Infection_in_Tanzania_for_Better_or_for_Worse) a negative correlation between female genital cutting and HIV. The authors of one of the studies, both seasoned statisticians who expected to find the opposite relationship, described their findings as a “significant and perplexing inverse association between reported female circumcision and HIV seropositivity.”

Again, no one would ever consider making FGM legal on the basis of these potential, prophylactic health benefits.

I would also like to bring to your attention something known as ‘cosmetic’ female genital cutting, which typically consists of medically unnecessary procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other alterations to the female genital organs for perceived cosmesis—widely practiced in Western countries and generally considered acceptable if performed with the informed consent of the individual. These consist of the **same** procedures that are typically classified as FGM.

Given that there is overlap (or a close anatomical parallel) between each form of WHO-deﬁned ‘mutilation’ and Western- style ‘cosmetic’ female genital cutting, neither of which is medically necessary, one must ask what the widely perceived categorical moral difference is between these two sets of procedures. Controlling for clinical context varies across the two sets and is often functionally similar—the most promising candidate for such a difference appears to be the **typical age**, and hence **presumed** **or likely consent-status**, of the subject. But if that is correct, it is not ultimately the degree of invasiveness (which ranges widely across both sets of practices), speciﬁc tissues affected, or the precise medical or non-medical beneﬁt- to-risk proﬁle of medically unnecessary (female) genital cutting that is most central to determining its perceived moral acceptability. Rather, it is the extent to which the affected individual desires the genital cutting and can consent to it. This suggests that the core of the putative rights violation is the **lack of consent** regarding a medically unnecessary intervention into one’s sexual anatomy. This consideration applies regardless of the sex or gender of the non-consenting person.

We were having trauma drama after our son was born, I have no history of physical violence, and thought we would get couples therapy and work it out... but looking back she was on a different policy. She said I was abusive and she feared for her life and that I would hurt our son. Looking back, through therapy with a licensed therapist, they were projections. I recall her even saying no one will believe me because you're a man in one of her slights. Something inside told me not to chase... she seemed to be building a trap or at least emphatic about painting me abusive. In the meanwhile, crushed because I lost my baby boy... but, I struggled and managed to barely maintain weekly video chats with my son through her. I also managed to find unsteady work in another State. It has been a struggle to make an income during the pandemic however I managed to save enough for an attorney by the end of the year and hire a inexpensive private investigator. Putting together that she is most likely living near her wealthy parents. Long story short, my attorney manged to send her papers through a postal box she provided. However the court in my State where my son was born will not accept jurisdiction because he has been out of State for longer than they require, so I have to re-file in the jurisdiction of my son. Which means I need a new attorney and possibly another private investigator. This was little over a month and half ago, I was referred an attorney in his area and she said I have a strong case, however I've been unemployed with no unemployment and almost out of savings unable to cover her retainer. At my current rate it seems it will take me almost a year to save.  


No longer connected to my immediate family for some many years, like most men I have a limited support network too.  


I came across Men's Rights and reading about it, so much of what I read is my whole life!... A mother who constantly controlled my emotions leaving me emotionally frustrated which often got painted as anger even tho I wasn't, feeling disposable as a man in society, being circumcised was a not my choice and feelings of violation, in relationships with projecting traumatized women, and the list goes on.   


My therapist was the first women who ever saw me, even calling me a gentle giant, who's just been mistreated and mishandled.  


Conclusion, I was supposed to be the stay at home parent and to this day I know I was/am the better ""mother"". I love my son dearly, he's my #1 and deserves his father too... but struggling to find my way... I'm so overwhelmed with struggle and pain feeling like I'm frozen, living in a constant nightmare. Maybe someone in this group has had a similar experience with some guidance or help.

I feel like I need to vent a bit. I'm a medical student and in my 3rd year. Needless to say, we're well into the realm of dealing with patients and helping out with their care and medical treatment etc...

The world of medicine, I've noticed, is *profoundly* gynocentric, to the extent I've actually started to second guess my career choices in becoming a Dr... CONSTANT messages about ""brave women in medicine"", and ""Encouraging and celebrating female doctors"", meanwhile males fall behind in education and women start to dominate medical school entry and graduates. The majority of new and young doctors are female, and with the education system essentially rigged to pull the best academic performance out of female students, celebrating females in a career path like medicine while males fall behind seems profoundly sexist to me... Our medical school even has a formal event called ""Women in Medicine"" dedicated to celebrating the female students in our course... It is truely pathetic....

On another point, EVERY gynaecology or breast lecture/tutorial we get, the teaching physician says something to the affect of ""now, MALE medical students REQUIRE a chaperone, because we don't want any of these female patients accusing you of something you haven't done""... It makes my blood boil that my female colleagues can examine a female patient without ANY restrictions or concerns about false accusations, and they can approach these patients the same way they approach a patient with any other medical concern. AS a male? I need there to be a nurse free to sit with me while I do the exam, I need written consent from the patient, and I need to tip-toe around out of fear the female patient will misinterpret or dislike something I say and falsely accuse me of something like sexual assault.There were something like 45 accusations of sexual misconduct made against Doctors in January of 2020 in Australia, and only 2 were investigated further. in other words, 43 were verified FALSE. Male Drs are having these accusations made about them in seriously high numbers.... And what's worse is many of the male doctors who were accused, investigated, and cleared of any wrongdoing STILL have gender-based practice restrictions. Imagine being a male endocrinologist and not being allowed to see female patients (the majority of your patient list) because of a verifiably false accusation... Imagine losing your income, and imagine losing your reputation, just like that....

Tl;dr it's seriously dangerous being a male doctor dealing with female patients... And you're seriously under-appreciated as a male doctor, mainly because you're a male...",1614310135

However oddly enough if you search misandrist Clinton's quote , its actually supported , which is kind of yikes.

So lets evaluate this quote , ""Women are the primary victims of war"".

Now everyone is a victim in war however war affects men worse than women due to the draft , this is very evident in WW2 , as there were 35,000,000 soldiers who were killed  and most were  drafted.

Now even if we equate rape to murder ( which I think we should ) , its practically impossible for any faction to have raped 35,000,000 women , even if we looked at all the factions of World War II , its impossible , the Soviets had around 30,000,000 military personal , the Nazis had 13,000,000 and the other factions had a collective 15,000,000 or so.

So every Soviet soldier would have to rape , which is just impossible as the average Soviet Soldier had a lifespan of less than a day , even though the nazis raped alot and were by far the most brutal faction it would still be impossible as even if 1 in 10 Soviets raped , that means the Nazi's would have to rape around 32,000,000 , which is impossible.

So why this quote important? Well it shows the double standards that people have , keep in mind when Trump said ""grab them by the P "" people recoiled in disgust ( as they should ) however Clinton said somehting far worse yet gets no pushback at all?

I was like, neither my dad drinks nor anyone in the family (from aunt to uncles) drinks. Why such prejudice ? This was personal opinion of someone. Lets get to the unnecessary reward that the government is giving. What the government is trying to say?

1. Mothers are the reasons that their girls study. ( This is the reason they state )
2. Mothers are only carer for their children and father have no or very little part in a child future. ( This is what it feels )

I've gotten many nasty private messages, but I won't talk about them specifically here. I love women, I really do, but I don't think that current-day feminism has any benefit to society. I'm all for women's rights, but when you take away men's rights even further, it just doesn't make any sense to me. It's like common day feminism is only meant to assault men in any way possible. In school, men are taught not to rape, which is bullshit. Female teachers fuck little underage boys every single damn week and no one takes it seriously. Underage sex is still underage sex. To make things worse, these teachers can get pregnant and force the immature kid they had coerced into sex to pay child support. I'm sorry, but what? You want a kid who had no idea what he was doing, or the consequences and responsibilities that come along with sex, to pay for a grown woman who took advantage of him? How does that even make sense? That's just double-standard bullshit and you know it. All in all, I'm still for women's rights, but I'm against current-day feminism. Does that clear up the air with some of you? There's really no simpler way to put it. Regardless of what you guys believe, I'll never throw women under the bus as a whole just because of crazy feminists.

732,MensRights,"We’ve all heard the arguments saying that the feminists saying all men are rapists are only a small radicalized minority and that this group makes feminism look bad when in actuality like 85% of feminists on the planet or some shit are actually for equality for both men and women.

Next time you get into one of these arguments hit them with this...

“Let’s say for a minute that this is indeed true, that radical feminism is just a minority that speaks over the whole movement and makes actual feminists look bad.

Why would you rather go through the vast lengths it would take to clear feminisms reputation when you can simply just call yourselves men and women’s rights activists?

You could spend the nanoseconds worth of time and energy to just stop associating yourself with an already widely unaccepted movement amongst men but you choose to waste months of time and energy on end trying to fix the rational repulsive attitude men have towards feminism, why is that?

Also

You know that men as a whole at this point are on edge, most of us have severe issues due to the inherently destructive behaviors that we were (and still are) slammed with via social conditioning from a very young age. 

You know that men’s issues are being either created or sent to the next extreme every day by feminists across the globe.

You know this point men as a whole are so unprotected and left so vulnerable in our society that a group of women with a decent level of social political standing could come up one day and say 90% of all men need to be castrated at birth for the safety of women and the only reason that wouldn’t happen is cause men make up like 99% of world governments and military.

You know the reason men react in such a negative way towards feminism is cause we fear for our lives which feminism is putting at risk more and more each day with its words and actions.

You know men are hurt and are acting like women do when their rights and lives are being threatened.

And most importantly you know feminism is the biggest threat to men today and you know you could do something to help men

Yet you choose to support and even defend feminism then choose to tell us men that we’re wrong for reacting to attacks on their well being, we’re wrong for despising feminism, we’re wrong for going “oh boy” whenever someone says they’re a feminist etc.

Sorry if this sounds a little harsh but saying you support my rights yet you claim you stand with and support the people who took them away from me doesn’t make you sound credible or trustworthy in any capacity, if you truly were for men’s rights you’d acknowledge that feminism is the last thing men will stand with or for and stop associating yourself with a clearly sexist and deceptive movement.”",1614733524

765,MensRights,"In the 1970s, feminists attempted to create a false etymology for the phrase *""rule of thumb""*.  It was claimed that husbands used to be able to beat their wives so long as they used a stick or a whip no thicker than their thumb.

This is of course not true, and the real etymology for the phrase comes from a practice of using the length or width of your thumb as a unit of measure.

You'd be surprised just how many people believe this to be true though.  The idea that men could legally beat their wives is a cornerstone of feminist dogma that they've tried to push for decades.  The evidence for this practice, however, is basically non-existent.  There are a couple court cases from the 1800s where men have seemingly gotten away with hitting their wives, but it has never actually been a legal practice under US law or under English common law.

And even those court cases that some feminists try to cite seem fairly lackluster. In one such case, the husband was found innocent due to a lack of bruising or marks on his wife.  Which feminists try to interpret as, ""it was fine so long as you didn't beat your wife too severely"".  Even if such a husband did get away with hitting his wife, clearly it was still a crime since it was prosecuted. And the reason he was found innocent came down to a lack of evidence, not because there was a misogynistic loophole that he took advance of.  

Other court cases ruled on interpretations of English common law, which is taken to help legitimize the idea that some form of wife abuse used to be legal. However, those court rulings consistently found insufficient evidence to justify an exception, including for cases of ""mild discipline of your wife"".  Which if anything seems like evidence against this, not in favor of it.

Domestic violence wasn't explicitly outlawed in the US at a federal level until the early 1900s, which is another talking point you see about this. But it was still illegal at the state level going back to the 1600s. And would have also been illegal under regular assault laws. This is because there weren't any legal exceptions granted to husbands to assault their wives the way feminists like to say there were.

Even more damning is that wife abuse (but not husband abuse) carried with it very cruel and unusual punishments throughout most of history.  Under one law, a husband accused of beating his wife would be buried with just his head left above the ground so that his wife could do whatever she wanted to him in retribution.

In fact it was actually husband abuse, not wife abuse, that used to be legal in history.  Under some laws, a wife was not only allowed to beat her husband, but if she did, it was used as evidence that the husband had actually done something wrong and needed to be punished *even more*.  The assumption is that he had to have done something to piss her off bad enough to hit him.  And him making her mad, but not her hitting him out of anger, was deemed to be a crime.  Under some versions of this law, the punishment for making your wife angry enough to hit you included being drug throughout town by horses.

The expectation, both socially and legally, was that husbands were supposed to be subservient to their wives, not the other way around.

So not only is this feminist view lacking in evidence, but the very opposite of it seems to have been true.  

Here is a source I've been using for this for a while:

######The ""Great Taboo"" and the Role of Patriarchy in Husband and Wife Abuse

https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1855/f217b082603d0ab37ea80c4741fceb8a4a23.pdf

Full text:

https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+%22great+taboo%22+and+the+role+of+patriarchy+in+husband+and+wife+abuse-a0165430144

Not only does it go into the background of this controversy, the authors analyzed a bunch of papers that claim that wife abuse used to be legal to show that their citation trails basically go nowhere.  The only legitimate primary source is something written in the 1700s by Sir William Blackstone, an English judge. He claimed that someone told him that you could use moderate discipline on your wife at some distant point in the past, but even he couldn't find a reference to it in older law books. He then went on to say that such a thing would be obviously illegal in modern times (meaning in 1700s England).  Thus apparently refuting the claim in the very source that is commonly cited as evidence for it.  Modern historians have of course found no evidence for this, either.

Like a lot of things you come across in the context of gender and gender equality, I was expecting this to be fairly unknown outside of the men's community.  Obviously there are academic references but just because you have sources doesn't mean it's widely known about.

On a whim I decided to check out Wikipedia, just to see how this was handled there.  And I was surprised to find that not only was this mentioned as a myth, but the article itself went into a good bit of detail over the history of this revisionist claim.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb

Clearly there's been a bit of ""debate"" that's played out on this page, given the length of discussion that's afforded to this just in the intro section (where it goes back and forth with a few feminist talking points sprinkled in here or there). But ultimately the facts have prevailed.

What I found interesting is just how much time, energy, and money feminists have put into making this seem like a legitimate fact.  To quote Wikipedia,

&gt;In the 20th century, public concern with the problem of domestic violence declined at first, and then re-emerged along with the resurgent feminist movement in the 1970s.[3] The first recorded link between wife-beating and the phrase *rule of thumb* appeared in 1976, in a report on domestic violence by women's-rights advocate Del Martin:

&gt;&gt;For instance, the common-law doctrine had been modified to allow the husband 'the right to whip his wife, provided that he used a switch no bigger than his thumb'—a rule of thumb, so to speak.[5]

&gt;While Martin appears to have meant the phrase *rule of thumb* only as a figure of speech, some feminist writers treated it as a literal reference to an earlier law.[5][19] The following year, a book on battered women stated:

&gt;&gt;One of the reasons nineteenth century British wives were dealt with so harshly by their husbands and by their legal system was the 'rule of thumb'. Included in the British Common Law was a section regulating wifebeating [...] The new law stipulated that the reasonable instrument be only 'a rod not thicker than his thumb.' In other words, wifebeating was legal.[20]

&gt;Despite this erroneous reading of the common law (which is a set of judicial principles rather than a written law with individual sections) the spurious legal doctrine of the ""rule of thumb"" was soon mentioned in a number of law journals.[3][7] The myth was repeated in a 1982 report by the United States Commission on Civil Rights on domestic abuse titled ""Under the Rule of Thumb"", as well as a later United States Senate report on the Violence Against Women Act.[3]

&gt;In the late 20th century, some efforts were made to discourage the phrase *rule of thumb*,[7] which was seen as taboo owing to this false origin.[3] Patricia T. O'Conner, former editor of the *New York Times* Book Review, described it as ""one of the most persistent myths of political correctness"".[5] During the 1990s, several authors wrote about the false etymology of *rule of thumb*, including the conservative social critic Christina Hoff Sommers,[3] who described its origin in a misunderstanding of Blackstone's commentary.[12] Nonetheless, the myth persisted in some legal sources into the early 2000s.[3]

There are other myths floating around out there as well.  For example it is often said that you could beat your wife on certain days of the week or in certain locations (commonly the courthouse steps on Sunday).

Despite being widely repeated and endorsed by feminists, as near as I can tell, that one is a myth also:

https://www.thisismysouth.com/11-unusual-outdated-southern-laws/

So why make these efforts to rewrite history?

And what does it say about your ideology that you have to make things up to help legitimatize it?

This isn't the only area that feminists have engaged in historical revisionism.  Other examples include the nature of coverture under English common law (a type of marriage), the treatment of women as literal slaves to men, and of course the history of the movement itself.  ""First wave feminism"" and ""second wave feminism"" weren't actually older incarcerations of feminism. Most of those people didn't call themselves feminists and they definitely wouldn't have agreed with modern feminist ideology. However a great deal of time and effort has been made to appropriate their accomplishments under the banner of feminism.

The good news is that a lot more attention has been given to this recently.  Sources are easier to come by and there have even been a couple books written by impartial historians about this (including at least one book, *The Privileged Sex*, where the author went in to it under the assumption that women were oppressed, and was surprised to find just how incorrect of a view that is).

Facts can't be hidden forever.  You can try to rewrite history all you want, but people are going to find the truth when they actually go looking for it.",1614700612

773,MensRights,"A few months ago we were gathered in a flat chilling. A few men and women. People started drinking and having fun, dancing... Not one person in the room was drunk by definition cause most had to work the next day . I recall the story better than anyone because I was the only one who didn't drink, because I simply don't drink and I could see whether someone was getting out of hand. Wasn't the case from start to finish.

The 2 started making out aggressively and full of passion just in front of me and they went to the 1st room on the left. Every room was connected to the living room, so you could hear what was happening in any room even if you didn't want to. They just started having sex and were loud doing their thing, both dirty talking. I can't tell you exactly what they said cause I wasn't paying attention but that tone of voice was dirty talking undoubtedly.

Fast forward, a couple of days ago, I heard that there's a rumour going around town (I don't live in that town but I used to, so I spend time there) regarding that night (their hookup). Her friends apparently asked her whether it was true that she hooked up with him and she allegedly said that she was too drunk and remembers having sex but not even with who. Which is absolute bs. The friends told her that that's assault and are persuading her to take action without even trying to ask her anything related. Both were in immaculate condition, my friend isn't what you would deem as popular and apparently only I and another girl knew they hooked up. She's  refusing to take legal action but they keep persuading her.

I'm 100% sure that her intention wasn't to get to this point but more like to give an excuse as to why she fucked the nerdy guy no one fucks, it backfired and now she probably doesn't know how to manage the situation or is willing to admit it. I spoke to her very politely and told her that I was there sober and she didn't seem to be drunk whatsoever and nobody did drugs. She said that she doesn't want to go forward with the law but she was drunk. I didn't argue cause what's the point? I know that she knows the law isn't something to make a joke about and that the truth will get out there and will destroy her and her reputation like it is doing to my friend right now.

The guy is scared shitless because even though he knows myself and the other girl would come forward if necessary, anything can happen if they end up persuading her. The town is divided. Most women haven't even questioned him and are assuming he assaulted her and the other half of people trust the facts that I gave them. To me this isn't a matter of friendship. If I heard anything odd whatsoever I would have undoubtedly walked in the room and see what's going on. Wasn't the case and now the guy can't even sleep just from thinking about it.

Funny things my husband and I know more men falsely accused of being abusers or harassers/rapists than women who were raped/harrassed. At least 2 of husband's former colleagues got ripped to the bones in a divorce.

I have always told my husband if we divorce I am okay 50/50 custody and actually I don'twant full custody, I don't want his money or his 401k. All I would ask is that he gives me time to get myself comfortably out and a portion of my share of the house because I wouldn't want it to be sold (VA loan and he has to live in it) through a cash out refinancing which seems fair. We both care about our children and one spouse ripping the finances of the other, spending all their assets into lawyers and court would be making our children even more miserable than needed, divorce is tough on them.

I have experienced sexism but honestly don't feel like the world is against me. If anything I have been given a harder time by other women. I prefer male doctors, yes even Obgyn (my son was delivered by one and I was so pissed when he moved to another state when I was expecting my daughter. The best doctor I ever had) 

In all honesty I am not afraid for my daughters (6yo) future, but my son (9yo). How do I protect him once he gets older, as early as middle school from those bitches that play the feminist card taught by their karen mothers. How do protect him from someone falsely accusing him just because he dared asking her out, or he broke up with her and she wants revenge. How do i make sure he doesn't get trapped because one decided to stop using her BC and got pregnant to keep him? 

I am not afraid about teaching my daughters to stand up for herself if she ever encounters some jerk (because they exist, feminists use these to justify their movement) 
I also know teaching respect to my son is important because I don't want him to listen to negative influences that some friends could bring (both genders have these) but I don't want him to be a pushover either who gets victimized because he made a joke that some female decided to label as""sexist"". 

The only thing I could side with feminists is about abortion. Old men politicians and religious folks better stay out of my body when making laws. I also believe abortion rights protect males who get trapped into an unwanted pregnancy. Sadly there are stories of women who get pregnant (stop taking birth control)to keep the guy. We all know that doesn't work, for the boys safety they need a way out when they realize their mistake. 

I am a woman who doesn't let anyone walk over her, men and women together. I hate women whose definition of equality is men persecution the same way I hate sexist pigs. And idc if some guy looks at my a.. (make sure my husband doesn't see you though), I check good looking men too. I tease my husband on hot males like Jason momoa, Chris Hemsworth the same way he teases me about Katty perry or scarlet Johanson. If anything women are more perverse than men (even though I agree porn depiction of women is gross). 

Just wanted you to know. We re not all bad!

Let's not diminish the fight of feminists who did so in good faith, we don't want to be accused of ""patriarchy"". I am also pro choice and I want to help men who got the wrong end of the stick handed to them because a woman screwed him over.

833,MensRights,"**This is a long post and I didn't add tl;dr, because I need to explain everything briefly. I am sorry for no tl;dr, but discussing these issues are very important to understand and help men's mental issues.**

We all know that a man's status can differ. They can be working class, they can be white collar working class, they can be rich or they can be middle class. Yet, the society not only compare men within their socio-economic class, but also compare men within different classes, a ""cross-class"" comparement.

At the end, the measurement will be done by looking at two things: How much the men earns, and how many partners they get. You can achieve something great scientifically, you will be headlines for once. Eventually, if you can't turn it into huge money or investment, you will be forgotten. 

This is not only done by men, but women also values men based on these things. After all, we are a society and every gender is part of the society they live in. 

 This is a huge problem. Men who can barely sustain their life plus not getting laid are suicidal. Yes. They feel weak, worthless and complete failures. Men who can sustain their life can cope a little, while men who can sustain their life and get married without divorce can also cope enough. Marriage is somehow viewed as a ""success"" by society, even by most progressive ones. Somehow marrying resets your past mistakes, and you are baptised by marriage. The man gets a life-long partner, so he must be succesful; that's one of the highest levels of success for working class men. If they can manage to avoid huge debts, may be buying a house with debt or mortgage, get their children in school and get them jobs and marriages, they will reach their peak level of success. 

Now, of course if their children can get into middle class, that will be beyond their realistic goals. Anyways. My point is, to feel successful, secure, worthful and complete, a men has sets of tasks given to them by society. To be worthy, you need to complete them. Each men, according to their socio-economic class, has different sets of tasks. And all link to earning money and getting laid.

We all know incels, or heard about them. If we break down their psychology, or ""lonely man"" psychology in general, we can find that most lonely man, even if they are surrounded by people, can't feel ""complete"". They lack the satisfaction. We, humans, have an evolutionary response for loneliness, or not accepted by society: depression. This feeling is a defence mechanism of body to stop doing acts that secludes them from society. Still, if you are successful at work and have a social life, but can't get satisfacted for varying reasons, you will feel lonely. And this loneliness eventually lead to depression.

Yes. Getting laid won't make you more men, and not getting laid won't make you a lesser men. I did have many partners and girlfriends, but it shouldn't be the main focus of our lives. I see many young men feel bad for not being able to get a girlfriend. That shouldn't bother you, but the system and society wants you to feel bad. It is designed in that way, and our one of the first struggle shall be against these norms. Men shouldn't be valued by how much they earn and how many partners they can find.

Also, we all know what this means. To get more money, you either need to be rich because money attracts money, or you need to get in a good earning job. Otherwise, like if you are the clerk at McDonalds cashier, you are doomed. And, to get partners, our today's society is very ""lookist."" I see many men being rejected because of them being at medium or short height, or not being very well looking. Money can cover up all of them, but if you don't have money, then your look really matters. The system doesn't only forces men. They also make women think they are worthless unless they get the best partner for themselves. Like I said before, the society is not made up by a single gender, and both gender are victims of this system and society. This is why we all dream about a united struggle, a solidarity where men and women fight for their worth and rights against the system. 

Now, let's talk about reasons of these problems in a very summarized way:

**Reasons:**

 To breakdown these reasons, societal norms are not enough to explain everything. The capitalistic world, where there is an illusion of choice, freedom and ""competition"", makes everything worse. There is no denying that capitalism uses every method to ensure it's own safety, profit and presence, and has no shame into destroying lives, souls and environment in the process. There is no freedom of choice, but we are raised to believe that we have. Getting different unhealthy snacks from supermarkets is not freedom of choice. We don't have freedom after all; we can't get in the hermit life just like that. Ensuring survival and living in harmony with nature is near impossible in today's world. The most brutal truth about it was colonisation of Africa. You can never be left alone in any corner of the world. And finally, the illusion of ""competition.""  
   
There is no competition. We ""compete"" with each other to be best servants of their system. They don't want you to start up your own small business and live peacefully. They want everything to serve in their economic mechanism that allows them to earn most, and be the dominant class. If you can get into their chamber, you are welcome. Otherwise, we are all equally piece of shits, and will be treated in that way. We will compete with each other, harm each other, block each other or even plot against each other. So, only the ones who can serve better will rank up. And most of us, I mean almost none of us will be CEO of McDonalds who earns millions of dollars per year.  

And men are also got into the plastic surgery trap. This is a market, and it targeted women first. They made women feel inferior and worthless when they weren't just like celebrities they presented. Celebrities are one of the aristocratic establishments of capitalism. Their main task is to set up the standards for society, and make it look like those standards are mere average. Being 10/10? It's just average. They don't even get any plastic surgery(!), they just drink lots of water. Yes, they targeted women first like I said. Women who felt worthless because they couldn't meet these standards of course tried plastic surgery, so they could feel better. It's not their fault, and we should be fair about it because sometimes I see people blaming women for these stuffs. It's not their fault. 

Now, men are being targeted by this beauty market. Buy products to look handsome. Get your nose and chin done. Get some more jawline. Because outlook and money are all that matters. Nothing else has any meaning in todays society, and we are both slaves and consumerists of the system.

Thanks for reading. I hope we can help our fellow brothers with their mental issues. We should encourage them. We should tell them that not getting laid or not earning much is totally ok. They need to find things that they love in this world, and get on the track. Don't let the system and society ruin everything. It is a fight against the world designed to make us suffer, and we are all veterans of this war.",1614852498

845,MensRights,"First incident was when I was 16. I was trying to be friendly with a kid out in public, and his Mom grabbed him away and gave me the filthiest look ever. 

Now I know to most people that would seem like a harmless minor incident that should be ignored. But think about the implication: I was just labeled as a PEDOPHILE.

And another time was when my friend brought his girlfriend over, and she'd keep getting annoyed/uncomfortable every time I looked in her direction. And then I had to consciously divert my gaze away from her and now think about where I was looking. 

And I was once walking out in the street at night and this girl walking in front of me burst out into a run and starting running forwards. 

And during university, there were a couple of girls who'd actively avoid me (I once offered a seat next to me to one of them and they ignored me and walked to the other side of the classroom). All because I was an introvert who wasn't outgoing. Girls don't like reserved quiet guys (unless they're Robert Pattison). 

I know to most people these might seem like minor harmless issues. But my self esteem is nowhere near as pristine as it was when I was a 15 year old. All of these years of '' women trying to be safe '' has  damaged my self esteem. And I know I'm not the only one, a lot of men have endured this. 

I used to know another guy with Aspergers who would always avoid women because he was afraid of '' creeping them out ''.",1614830393

850,MensRights,"E: Oops. Male sexuality that is attracted to women, in some form, that is.

**Disclaimer**: I didn't feel like making a million fucking ""sarcasm"" quotation marks, apply them as necessary while reading. lol

This is hypocrisy in the purest form, they use old anti-porn feminist arguments and logic when dealing with issues that relate to female sexualization through the male gaze, and call it objectifying and dehumanizing, and yet they switch over to sex-positive arguments and logic when it comes to their own sexualization and self-objectification, insisting that it is healthy or even empowering when a woman chooses to do it, regardless of the circumstances or context. The issue is that those anti-porn arguments are fundamentally sexist, and sex-negative against women, they imply that women are inherently demeaned by their own sexuality relative to a male's.

Yet, this sexist logic that concludes women are sexually inferior to men, is allowed to be weaponized against us and to shame our own natural biology, without implying anything negative towards women. They will assert that they are being sexualized in ways that are inherently sexist, that sexuality itself isn't the problem, it is because we view them as sexual objects, but this is nothing but bullshit assumptions. A woman being objectified is seen as more harmful than a man, because of the implied sexual shame for women. Women were primarily valued for their looks, femininity, and domestic role long before the sexual revolution ever took place.

Now, just to clarify, I want to express that my issue is that they simply twist their ideology to benefit themselves at every turn, I am against the ludicrous double standard that this represents. I am not in favor of shaming men or women for sex, just because we have different biology. I want to create a more sex-positive and equal society, apparently much more so than feminists do. Feminists want to hide behind their victim status when it is convenient, and put unnecessary suffering onto men in the process. I can't express how fucking insane it is that their whole theory of objectification is widely accepted, despite being a mess of contradictions.",1614825132

when boys go into puberty and start looking for more mature content, they will pop into those YouTubers who do low effort Reddit videos and reaction videos but they will show off cleavage. this in itself is not an issue, and younger boys seeing this is also not a big deal, but I feel they should understand what is happening. you know that they are feeling arousal or attraction to said YouTubers. but they don't know that, and whether this is predatory and manipulative is another topic altogether. you see I fell into this trap of not understanding why I watched these YouTubers because at the time I was watching another more interesting and understandable Reddit YouTuber who made real content. I did not understand the feelings I felt towards these YouTubers and I think that that isn't good. I also see my younger brother finding these YouTubers and I think that boys should have the information to understand what is happening. also, some personal things are happening with my brother that are very personal and I will not share even though you guys have had the same thing. also, mods if you don't like can you direct me to a place where the mods will like this post.

908,MensRights,"So basically I was a temp at this job, and there was a woman there who seemed a little interested in me as something more than a friend. I do have above average looks so I'm not too unfamiliar with this happening to me. But I had a girlfriend and this woman coworker of mine was 10 years older than me at the time and divorced. Anyways I got to know her over the weeks and one day she invited me to her house for dinner. I accepted because she had been very nice to me and I know she's a good cook. When I got there she gave me a glass of wine which was laced with some kind of roofie that made me become something of a vegetable but still conscious. After about half an hour the roofie kicked in and she started with the raping. When she was done she also took what I can only assume was another roofie because she laid down on the floor and soon she was in the same state that I was. A couple hours later I started being able to move fully again and I left while she was sleeping, probably high as fuck. 

I decided not to be a pussy about that and on Monday I talked to my female boss who just sat there and smiled and sometimes giving me the ""are you stupid enough to think I'll believe that?"" look while I told her this story. I wasn't too emotionally scarred by the incident itself, honestly my biggest concern was that my girlfriend might find out and dump me. But after I had told my story I could tell my boss was about to start laughing but she said she would talk with my rapist about this. Her office had glass walls and I was looking into that room and could see my rapist crying. I though that she had been fired and that was the end of that. But no. I get called back into my boss's office and she locked the door when I got in. Then she told me that she had called the police and that I were to wait in her office until they arrived to take me away for rape. 

Fast forward a bit and I'm in jail, and no one believed my story. Not the interrogation officer, not the arresting officer and not even my family and friends. The only one that believed me was my girlfriend and her parents. Luckily they were rich and could afford a good lawyer. 

I also had the luck to get a fair judge and jury who eventually gave me a non guilty verdict. Now what did the rapist get who drugged me with an illegal substance before raping me? A promotion and a TV interview about speaking up against rape. What did I get? Kicked out of my apartment, fired from my job and probably have little to no hope to get a good job in the future.

909,MensRights,"In honor of international women's day, I would like to post some of my conclusions following several years of research on feminism, men's rights, and the gender war.

1) What group is primarily hurt by the division of men and women resulting in the fragmentation of the family?

It is the lower classes, who depend upon the cooperation of individuals, who are primarily hurt by any loss of social cohesion. The more money a person has at their disposal, the more insulated that individual is from the effects of social deterioration. They can simply purchase what they need and throw money at any problems that come their way. The less money you have, the more you need the cooperation of others for survival, even more so to thrive. 

The upper classes have a long history of using social issues to fragment the lower classes, one prominent example is the widespread use of race baiting on syndicated news programs, who despite any claims to the contrary, serve as nothing more than mouthpieces of the ruling economic elites. Multinational corporate support of feminism, serves this function and any divide in the family hits at the heart of the functionality of the working class as anything more than simple wage slaves- a condition that corporate interests require to maintain a philosophy of endless growth.

2) What group benefits primarily from the division of men and women, resulting in the fragmentation of the family?

Since the rise of feminism, the average wage of the working class, adjusted for inflation, has stagnated (if not dropped). At the same time, the productivity of multinational corporations has steadily increased to the point that certain individuals in the economic elite have as much money if not more than the federal government. At the same time, social programs that benefit the working class have been systematically cut, things like school funding, welfare programs, social security, and unemployment insurance (all providing valuable safety nets and resources), in order to fund systematic cuts to the taxes paid by these individuals and institutions. So long as they are divided against each other along the lines of race and gender, the lower classes cannot mount an effective defense against the squeeze. With this ungodly wealth the elites now have at their disposal, it is an easy thing to buy off the government to turn a blind eye to their enslaving, usurious practices. From the legalization of corruption through citizen's united to the outright theft of elections, the government is now their strong arm. 

From this, we can clearly see what feminism is: an ideology co-opted by multinational corporations and the economic elite to hobble the working class and strong arm them into perpetual wage slavery in order to maintain a philosophy of unlimited growth.

So, MRA's

Don't expect the government to support you.

Don't expect wealthy corporations to support you.

The video is still online, so maybe in the future they will try to ""revise de history"" and frame this trash as a successful campaign that was ""necessary"" against the ""evil and toxic"" men. 

At the time, Gillette executives defended this atrocity and crafted bizarre ideological explanations fuled by the support of the puppet feminist media, but after millions in loses and a huge criticizism Gillette was forced to shift their advertising and ditch their misandrist focus, at least for now.

We need to always remember about this iconic case and use it as an example on the importance of being active critics in mass in the public spaces (not just within the internal debate spaces).

985,MensRights,"I'm new to this sub, but after being severely abused by two romantic partners in my life, I've become much more personally involved with men's rights. I might get into it in future posts but here's my current concern...  


Just now on facebook, I saw a post telling us to teach men to not normalize touching women's waists as you pass them by. I've never personally done this or felt a need, and of course touching someone like that shouldn't be accepted, but I've become admittedly jaded. Yes, I agree it shouldn't be done, but the wording of the post came off as bigoted and demonizing to men. I immediately thought: what about all the women I've known that say ""excuse me"" once, and then proceed to push the man out of the way before he even has time to react.

It's not just they they push past them, they do it aggressively. What I observe is that the specific women who do this enter the situation expecting to be disrespected. The last time I saw this was at a bar, and a man was standing talking to a group of friends. The woman said excuse me and he obviously didn't hear her, simple as that. She perceived it as him purposefully ignoring/disrespecting her, and proceeded to elbow him out of the way. No one said anything, no one did anything. They allowed it to happen and let her get away with it without consequence. To me, this normalizes it, because the woman who got away with it leaves the situation feeling as if she's in the right, because no one told her it was wrong.   


It's funny to me, because society views men as the aggressors, but in my experience, most of the aggression and hostility I've experienced has come from women. Now, obviously I'm not saying this to diminish violence women have experienced, I'm simply describing something men experience and nothing more. In hindsight, I see men being physically pushed around a lot; concerts, bars, and subways to name a few. It's not necessarily an every day occurrence, but it happens enough that I notice it, and no one seems to care enough to speak out about it. 

Has anyone else noticed this trend? I know for a fact I wouldn't appreciate being elbowed, and I sure as hell am not out to disrespect anyone. If I don't move, it's because I didn't hear you.",1614896742

989,MensRights,"So me and my friend had a discussion today. (We focused on US, and excluded third world countries as women have it worse there)

It was about the topic if there should also be a month dedicated to men.

I was on the side that there should be, to not create a toxic gap between both of the genders, to bring awareness to mens problems as well.

Whether it would be sort of awareness month or just mens history month, or something of this sort.

My friend however said that men don't deserve this kind of a thing.

As they didn't suffer enough compared to women.

My points were divorce cases, men being forced to go to war, false abuse or rape accusations, suicide rates, or just how media don't cover as much of the problems that men face as women do.

Over time it went from talking about if there should be a month like that to an argument of whether men's issues are equal to female issues.

It got to the point where there were 2 sides.

Mine: Both genders issues should be treated equally, and we should aspire to solve both of them.

My friends: We should prioritise women issues over mens.

I said that we should be prioritising both genders problems as postponing the other genders problems would only make society root from the inside.

But I guess having this opinion makes me an incel.

Guess we should only focus on female problems, and ignore the struggles that males have to face in the current day.

**Take into consideration it could be biased from my side, as we both got frustrated at each other that argument.**

So what do you think? 

Edit: I just wanted to say this because its been stressing me today. Im allowed to study online or in person. I study online and my friend studies in person. We had the discussion on a discord call. I just don't want rumours of me being an incel spreading, and me not being able to do anything.",1614890763

 Is it not okay to talk about paternity?

In one post I brought up that a school project had children get their parents blood types. It turned out that 30% of the children were not the father's biological children. People freaked out trying to shame me for posting that.

In a different post I brought up the 23 and me (also other DNA matching companies) it is speculated that overall the number is near 30% of the people who were not related to their father's.

I mentioned in both of these posts and others that it is speculated as there has not been an actually study. People still flip out.

Is it wrong to know if your child is your genetic legacy?

At home paternity tests are not all that expensive and I am curious about how many men are paying child support for another man's legacy.

International Women's Day and the likes has always been triggering me. Go ahead. Call me a snowflake and weak. You will not be the first one. Also - yes. I know I have a lot I need to deal with and I have attempted (and continue will try) to seek counseling for it.

Ever since I was sexually abused by a woman (the alternative would be to be homeless) who just ""loved \[me\] so much"" and nobody took me seriously or I had to hear about women's issues instead whenever I would bring it up, International Women's Day is bullshit to me. I am sick of women getting all of the attention. Oh here are some statistics on women who are abused per day. Here is the number of women raped each month. Here is - women women women women women women women.

When the hell are men going to start to be able to talk about their issues? The United Nations even tweeted out on International Men's Day about women and a big ol' thank you to men who SUPPORT WOMEN.

Fuck women.

Oh yeah. And I was homeless for a bit after I decided being homeless would be better than being psychologically, economically, and drugged my way into forced sex. Ironically? I couldn't find a shelter because women scared me and I did not trust them. There are plenty of women's shelters. No men's shelters. Why? Cus its sexist. RIGHT?!",1615241717

The email talks upcoming seminars with lots of **lady VPs, Senior VPs** who'll share their **personal experiences**, their **career-stories** for **women**. They'll also have various counselling rounds for women for the following things:

* Personal stories of top management 
* Leadership talk
* Inspirational - ""Dare to be different""

A few weeks ago **the HRs** organized an entire day for **women employees' development**:

* Being assertive at work (even more than they already are)
* Work-life balance
* How to say no
* Followed by counselling rounds for them

These events are **exclusively for women**. I call **BS** on this. Just how much more are we going to empower these bit\*\*es? 

And most of the women employees that I've personally met in the software industry are **extremely F'ing NEEDY!** They need help with the manuals, help with what work needs to be done, they need help with emotions as well! I know that that sounds cliched and you might not believe me but I've experienced this first hand!

And lastly, **they don't want to acknowledge** taking the help. You sit with them for an hour helping them/mentoring them for a fucking technical task that they were supposed to figure out on their own. And at the end there is no real gratitude. They're like ""Yeah, it's your job to explain to me"". No bitch! It ain't my job to spoonfeed you! It's your job to figure things out. Just like the f'ing rest of us.

Next, I came across an email that promotes this **""Grass Hopper conference"".** I checked out this conference's website and it's an entire fucking conference that is dedicated exclusively for women in tech! Can you believe this shit? 

This is outright racism! How about giving some support to men as well?

1129,MensRights,"Hey lads, first time caller long time listener here. 

As the title says, I fell down a reddit rabbit hole, found /r/superstraight and I'm interested to hear if anyone's been watching this and what thoughts they had, if any. I followed it for a couple of days and.. whew. I'm happy to be off the wild ride now, I think the sub has been shut down as of a few hours ago - I was just about done anyway - but must admit it was a guilty pleasure to follow and there was just *something* intriguing about watching the sub devolve in a matter of days (hours?) as far as I can tell.

For anyone out of the loop, I *believe* (and stand to be corrected on any of this) the whole ""movement"" is less than 2 weeks old. It apparently was started by a Tiktok user by the name of Kyle Royce, who posted about being guilted and called out by others over being attracted exclusively to women who were born female, and I believe he coined the term ""superstraight"" at that point. This meant acknowledging that trans women are indeed women and that if you're a straight man you're attracted to them just as much as any other type of women by default, hence the need for this new term to specify that as a heterosexual man you're only attracted to biological women and this makes you ""superstraight"" as it were. This ended up catching the guy a lot of flak and he was called out as transphobic etc. 

This is where I'm a bit hazy on the details - I really thought the subreddit was formed as a tongue-in-cheek response to the über woke reaction calling this guy out, but in essence wasn't to be taken overly seriously - they were using the abbreviation 'SS' for God's sake of course I thought it was a joke! I saw posts calling out ""superphobes"" and calling for superstraights to band together and unite for a greater good - it was a parody a-la the Super Best Friends in South Park - there was no way this was 100% for real. I saw it as shining a light on the ridiculousness of the extent woke culture has gone to and holding up a mirror to their cause with a ""cause"" of their own. I was into it because I genuinely don't think anyone should be given shit over who they are and aren't attracted to, or who they should be *allowed* be attracted to, and thought the ironic shitposts and memery was an ""up yours"" to anyone trying to guilt straight dudes telling them what to do - but also just saw it as a good time as I procrastinate on reddit. 

Soon it wasn't just straight dudes anymore, there were superstraight girls posting ""transitioning"" pics going from non pregnant to pregnant, people posting aryan looking ""super"" families, then supergays, superbis even supertrans (trans who were only attracted to trans) but hey the more the merrier we're just having a good time here. Lots and lots of superlesbians posting, I was still assuming at this point that there was a comedic air to all of this. People would post and ask if the sub was for real and of course people would respond that it was a legitimate sub, keeping in line with what I thought was the spirit of the sub, I even responded to one myself to assure someone that ""we"" were legit! Another time I suggested we have our own flag emojis - I said it thinking it would add an obnoxious authenticity to the movement but I think people thought it was unironically a good idea and it got something like 100 upvotes lol 

Extremely quickly the mood on the sub changed, terms like TERFs were being thrown around (Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists) posts were made about trans women raping biological lesbian women by coercing them into sex under the guise of being a fellow biological woman. Charity posts for women's shelters that banned trans women were posted and stickied. Someone commented with a link to a men's shelter that reached the top of the post and the OP responded that their focus would be on the women's shelter for now and that they wanted to concentrate on one at a time, to give people a break in between asking for donations. I didn't know that the sub had become a channel for fundraising or who the OP was as an authority to tell anyone who their money should go to while disregarding the other charity but the priority was stated clearly. 

I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but the penny had dropped at this stage that this was something else now, it looked like a hostile takeover from the remnants of the ""lgb drop the t"" crowd trying to make their reddit comeback. A quick Google and I saw a post on Ovarit from feminists who were rallied behind the superstraight cause for their own reasons but were giving a stark reminder to their own that straight dudes were appalling in general and that any allied common interest was an unfortunate coincidence. They were not to join in with the memes and humour because the straight dudes didn't care enough about women's rights or radical feminism and that women could not be funny in their eyes anyway. 

Tl;Dr - Piss-takey subreddit suggesting straight guys should be allowed choose who they wanna be with in the form of memes and shitposts becomes subject of hostile takeover by radical feminists within days who enforce their own agenda astonishingly quickly and lead to the sub having a transition of its own, sucking any and all fun out of it turning it into a dour, political black hole for humour. Men resume their rightful place as cause of all pain and suffering and are asked to fund a women's shelter shortly before the sub is driven into the ground altogether.",1615377013

I've noticed that a few of the men on here get obsessed with the level of hate and inequality that gets levelled towards men, and that's fair, but you gotta stay away from toxic communities like the feminism ones on here and in other places. In exposing yourself to all that hate, every day, you will be impacted by it. Men, please take care of yourselves. Have open and honest discussion here and in other spaces that are actually interested in equality, but when you go to those other forums that are only interested in female supremacy you will be shat upon from dizzying heights, and I can only assume that's what you might be looking for, because at this point you shouldn't be expecting that conversation to go differently. You're actively seeking out people who hate you, stop it, just live a good life, do good work, and take care of your communities. Toxic ideologies like feminism always die, it might be popular today, but a lot of hateful things used to be popular, all you have to do is keep speaking up for yourself in your every day life. Think of it this way, a black person making an impassioned speech about racial equality at a KKK rally is stupid because no one there is interested in their views and in fact actively hates them for being black, so making impassioned equality speeches and paragraphs in feminism groups is stupid because they do not care about men's rights and in fact actively hate you for being a man who loves himself.

&gt;Moses Farrow completely destroys the facially ridiculous notion that Allen would choose to molest Dylan in full view of everyone in house full of witnesses, as Orth implies here.      

&gt;He writes: “Along with five kids, there were three adults in the house, all of whom had been told for months what a monster Woody was. None of us would have allowed Dylan to step away with Woody, even if he tried. Casey’s nanny, Alison, would later claim that she walked into the TV room and saw Woody kneeling on the floor with his head in Dylan’s lap on the couch. *Really?

1145,MensRights,"Sorry for the format, and also if is not allowed or correct, but I need to share this.
This time surrounding the march 8th protests in my country put me in a critical point. 
I fully support the critique against the Mexican government for the lack of actions towards violence and their misogynistic behaviour.
Nevertheless, seeing all the hate speech shared in the social media towards men by the common folk, by women that at one moment I considered friends or colleagues... All the media coverage for the protests, also seeing my male friends arguing with my female friends about which gender is more ""victimised"" and how the feminist are too violent or too extremist, made me realize that the problem is not the injustice or violence from one gender to another...

What I realised is that all the modern society is showing the true idea: women's life is instrinsecally worthy. Therefore, all their problems are important, worthy of attention and action to be taken. 
The underlying message also is: Men's life is worthless, men are expendable, therefore their problems can be ignored as there are and there will be more men to fill the gap.

And that's what hurt me the most.

If we raise the banners to protest for men's rights, that our life is worthy, we will find ridicule, jokes and be minimised. That we should man up, that is not a big deal.
We are treated as mere numbers in the statistics.

And that will be my stand point from now on. Not fighting the feminist, not contradicting, but raising awareness on the men Issues, as the feminist did. But not asking for special treatment, only what is fair.",1615355820

There are a lot of people out there especially online that say that white men rule the world and receive extra privileges because of it but I very rarely see this. I have never been treated any different because Im a white dude. Not in school, not in public, not by family or friends. And I have never seen any different treatment of white males compared to other people that was helping the white men. I am even to go out and say sometimes it feels like I get treated worse because I am a white male. For example this post(1), and most of that sub. If I said something like that about women unless I said it to the far right I would become twitters new poster boy to hate, receive a lot of brutal comments, and probably receive a death threat. But she (presumably and i feel its a safe guess) can make fun of a issue that a lot of men face that affects their mental and physical health with encouragement? Now does the porn industry dehumanize women? Yes I agree with that but it also sets unrealistic expectations for men too and I sure as hell have never seen anyone say that. Theres also this post(2) which isnt upsetting but the comments are brutal. Theres one comment that really pisses me off too because its full of lies. ""Because men only ever pretend to care about men's issues when they're trying to shut down conversations about women's issues."" No. Just no. Remember when the boyscouts were shut down over the sexual abuse of boys? I dont know about all men but a lot of the ones I knew were happy that something like that was being put to an end. Then theres the thing that every day is mens day. Im genuinely concerned here. I guarantee you 100% the only men who agree with this are so far to the political right there wives arent allowed to speak unless spoken too and they arent the proudest examples of a man. The last thing is mens mental health. When women post something about depression or anxiety they are called strong and heroic (that isnt a bad thing its a fucking amazing thing) but when I do it somewhere that isnt centered around mental health I see a dramatically less happy comments. Ive been called weak and it hurts. Im expected to be strong and emotionless in public because I am a man.  The mens suicide rate is nearly 3x times higher and the homeless mens population is double. So I sit in bed tonight wondering, is there actually any privilege for men because it doesnt seem like it. Am I overlooking somethings? Maybe being a little dramatic? What do you think reddit?

**Important Note: I am not trying to downplay womens or minorities issues. I see that they too face hurdles in life but in my opinion (white) men are facing large hurdles and  hate. I do not encourage hating on anyone including the comments or the people in the post mentioned above. Do not do that it is a really bad thing to do.**

It's honestly quite depressing to see all this. This sub is now becoming more negative than positive, and we are just proving our hater's assumptions about us correct with how we behave. This place has become less about men's rights and combating the misandry we see on a day-to-day basis, and more for complaining about life's frustrations. We claim to have absolutely no tolerance for misogynists, but there are several MGTOWs who haven't been downvoted to all hell yet. Sooner or later, we won't be any better than r/MGTOW

\- Social Issues

\- Discrimination

\- Feminism

\- General

Sometimes you may see a post flared as ""Progress"" or ""Humour,"" but those make up the vast majority. Why do we call ourselves a movement if we aren't doing anything big to benefit our cause? People have already disproven the wage gap, feminism, and even the patriarchy. So if these are the major things standing in our way, why do we not at least try to change it? We have an already solid list of problems men face on a daily basis pinned to the sidebar, as well as an even broader list in our back pockets. Why do we continue talking about how hard life is when we aren't even taking the steps necessary to improve it? And I know that men can't win in today's world, and we'd get hate from incels screaming about how misogynistic we are for being fed up of the bs we face on a daily. But if we band together and protest a lot, we could make this work. Take the Women's Rights Movement as an example. Remember all the boomers shooting them down when they started out? Well, they persevered and managed to succeed at their goals. If they could do it, so can we! Maybe then we'll have less ""Discrimination"" in our feeds and more ""Activism/Support"" and ""Progress""

I'm pretty sure we can all agree that that there are a lot of problems men face that women often don't have to because of gender, I.E: Men commit suicide more often, the majority of homeless people are male, and so-on. But, one thing we, as men, might come to think is that women are born with more entitlement than men, and men have often used that to say that all women are bad. But that's just simply not true.

Now, before you tell me things like, ""Oh! You're one of the lucky ones!"" or, ""Oh! You're probably not even a real male for saying stuff like this!"" let me tell you a little story about myself:

I remember growing up in a small town in Montana, and would go out of town almost every Wednesday night to go to a Christian youth group. However, this circle of cliquey, popular girls, would often tease and prank me, but not on the biases of gender. Instead, they were teasing me because of my mental disability (being Autism). But as much as I know many females that have been like this - and even worse in some cases - I also know many females that aren't even a little like them. Such as my principle, who has given me many amazing opportunities to improve myself, and where I am, and my mom, who has also done just as much as my dad to provide for me (not dissing my pops. Love you dad!)

Also, let us not forget that there are so many women out there, who while speaking for women's rights, have also advocated for ours, like Helly Shah, or Allie Stucky. These brave women, and more, have advocated for us, and risked being labeled as bigots' and traitors for it!

At the end of the day, I know there are a lot of men, who have had a lot of bad experiences with women, and have used those experiences to hold a grudge against all women, but in my experience, that's because they haven't met any women that are better. Trust me, there are better women out there, people! I think my point is, we should judge people based on character, and not their gender.

So then they have more knowledge on how to make progress as a civilization, so they can finally be one with each other… Like how we once were… Before the Decepticons… When we were peaceful and just… And I promise you: We will be again peaceful and just.""

1215,MensRights,"I really love my mum. And normally we are able to talk about controversial issues quite well. But recently I tried to have a conversation with my mum about the men in the criminal justice system. I complained at a quote that said that men got away with crimes saying that was completely untrue and its a disgusting thing to say. Men face significant discrimination in the criminal justice system. But the problem is that my mum was a victim of domestic violence. So she sees her experiences in the criminal justice system and when i challenge them I'm essentially delegitimizing her experiences from her point of veiw. When I have conversations with her about these things i try to avoid the subject because i know its something she went through. But whenever i try to explain that I'm not trying to minimise her experience by saying women also commit domestic violence she shuts down and refuses to talk. I'm kinda fine with this more or less because i know she's not trying to be rude or ignore me she just finds the conversation hard. But for me, it really sucks cause I'm not trying to make my mum feel like any less of a victim but i don't see the harm in having more people know things about mra. I also hate leaving things unsaid. Like this is something in really believe in and we can disagree but i want to at least be able to have a conversation with my mum about this especially considering we never really talk about it as a family. IDK maybe i brought it up in the wrong setting I just really want to have the conversation, in general, and i think it would be hard if every time I say something it comes off as I'm either delegitimising her experiences or am just not listening.",1615498701

1251,MensRights,"In the UK at the moment, the disappearance of Sarah Everard has been a huge talking point. This has led to discussions on twitter and other social media outlets over women's safety. One of the most common points raised by women on this issue that I've always struggled with is 'Men need to hold other men accountable for their abusive behaviour' and I've never figured out what they mean by this and how to tackle this particular point.

Where have women gotten the idea that these awful rapists, murderers and violent men are sharing the information of their crimes with their friends (If they have any, the majority of the time the more serious ones are loners) How can we convince women that we are just as clueless as to who in particular we need to be calling out?

The second dilemma I've got is the safety at night thing. All people (Particularly in a city) should be wary at night. I went to Uni in Southampton and I always made sure I was walking home with someone at night or on the phone to someone the whole way home.

do you have the glasses from my last post? keep them on.

""**Heterosexual men always have and always will despise women.**""  
well uh thats a bold statement, switch the genders and that sounds like what an incel would say

""It is because they cannot both respect us and be sexually attracted to us, those things are always mutually exclusive.""  
you can respect someone and find them hot

""Their brain just somehow functions so that what they're attracted to sexually always has to be less than.""  
thats not how it works  
nobody sees their significant other as less than or their suboordinate, they see them as, idk, a **significant other?** 

""Heck, the whole Madonna-whore complex is a great example of this mindset. As soon as a woman becomes something he might even respect a little bit (she's still just an object to him, now gone from sexual to motherly), the sexual attraction disappears. ""  
we dont see you as objects. you've been on IncelsWithoutHate.  
you can be attracted to someone you respect - chances are if we dont like you, we dont respect you, no matter how highly you think of yourself. you can be however attractive, but with a personality like that, we dont respect you. if anything, you're 'objectified' when we no longer respect you - we might not like your personality, but we like your body - but if we respect you too, thats not the case

""If a man is sexually attracted to women, he just simply cannot see us as actual human beings. ""  
we recognize you as actual human beings  
like I know you're a real person behind Mutteriman  
I dont think I'd like you but I know you exist  
and there are various girls who I've been equals - even suboordinate - to and attracted to  
both romantically and sexually

  
""It has something to do with power; just think about how much some/many men hate homosexual men, especially the ones who are more submissive and feminine. ""  
we dont hate gay people  
we just don't respect those who dress as a clown **and before you call me out** I mean those who literally look like a clown  
RuPaul is fine, he's just looking feminine  
but the netflix thumbnail for his show has a literal guy with the clown hair and the white powder and all that

""They aren't ""men"" anymore and hence not human. To men, a person cannot be respected if he/she is in a receiving end sexually.""  
to you, maybe

""What makes this all so sad is that women are not like that at all. We've loved men and women all over the world continue to love them in such an innocent and pure way. We believe in romance and deep emotional connections. We are capable of seeing them as more than just objects. ""  
bruh really insulted half the human race and explains how the other half is perfect

""We can have male friends but (heterosexual) men can not fathom the idea of being friends with women; that would mean they'd have to see us as actual human beings first. ""  
just because none of your male friends dont want to be around you doesnt mean they objectify you because you're female  
I assure you its an attitude problem, the same way how incels arent rejected cause they're short - misogyny is bad for getting girls

""They always want to benefit somehow.""  
sex isnt neccesarily a perk though

"" Some might argue that there are so many gold diggers and shallow women, but it's really men who have made us that way. We've been taught to be dependent on men. We've been taught that only our looks and youth matter. How can men complain about a system they created? ""  
you **literally have an entire guide** that states men will immediately leave you if you arent perfect  
**A LITERAL FDS HANDBOOK THAT SAYS THAT**  
**AND IT USES THE SAME WORDS INCELS USE LIKE 'a becky' and 'a chad' I SWEAR**

the post in question in and of itself (dishonesty in a relationship) is a reasonable issue  
the response, however, is not  


**put on your glasses, you'll need them**

&gt;TLDR: Being a working woman is the goal because if you have your own money, you can leave. SAHM is a precarious position and risky. A HVM can turn low-value after 10, 15, or 20 years. So you should always be financially stable of your own accord. 

okay this is literally saying you should be a career woman so you can leave marriage  
right off the bat  


&gt; Majority of women who stay in abusive relationships do so because they do not have the financial ability to support themselves alone—especially if they have children. Case in point above. 

alright, this is true and to be fair thats a serious issue  


&gt; There also doesn't even have to be abuse. You could wake up one day and realize you have now become a ""mommy bangmaid"" or just plain old realize this is not the life you desire, and newsflash: you need money to leave. 

""he doesnt have to do anything. you can decide that you're a mother who takes care of the house, or realize you just dont like working, and leave""  
this is literal irresponsibility and **exactly** what deadbeat dads do - they decide they dont wanna rise to being a father, and just leave. you cant just decide you dont want to be a mother and walk off  


&gt;Some women on FDS say that if you want to be a SAHM you should have: a rock solid prenup, passive income before marriage, have a stash sufficient for your possible escape.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bullshit, that is not enough.  
&gt;  
&gt;Firstly, that isn't even realistic for most women since majority of households in America need two incomes to survive. In 2017, 54.4% of all household in America were [dual income](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2020/article/comparing-characteristics-and-selected-expenditures-of-dual-and-single-income-households-with-children.htm).  
&gt;  
&gt;Secondly, a woman would need enough money to not just sustain her during a divorce, but for a few years after. Losing out on career advantages and progress derails financial stability. She will need extra time to either go back to school or work her way up the ladder to a wage until she reaches a median salary for the country.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not to mention, no one wants to employ someone with a 10 year gap on their resume—and if they do happen to get hired, it's for well below the average salary. It's been proven statistically that [divorced women are significantly poorer than their married counterparts](http://marripedia.org/effects.of.divorce.on.financial.stability). And while women's livelihood **decreases** after a divorce, men's livelihood **increases** after a divorce.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thirdly, even a HVM is not going to sign a ""rock hard-prenup"" that will entitle his female partner to 85% of all assets. But I'll bite. Who's to say in the culmination of a divorce that he won't hide assets or properties? What will you do if your HVM is no longer a HVM and pulls LVM moves? A HVM can turn low-value after 10, 15, or 20 years. The person you marry is not the same person you divorce.

true  
you need money to leave

&gt;  
Thirdly, even a HVM is not going to sign a ""rock hard-prenup"" that will entitle his female partner to 85% of all assets. 

because its 85%  
this literally isnt even equality or maybe ""60-40 since hes asking you to marry him"" this is outright stupid

&gt; Clearly being a stay-at-home mother isn't working out in our favor—no matter how many women ***desperately*** want to stick to this traditional ideal. 

did someone say **our**?  
**again, working as a class does not help individuals - individualism is why some are better off than others, and you must accept that**

&gt;The *only* way this would work is (1) if you come from a well-off family that provided you with a padded trust fund, (2) you are highly educated in a lucrative, easily employable career (doctor, orthodontist, optometrist, etc), or (3) your husband gives you half of every paycheck.  
&gt;  
&gt;If this isn't you, don't be a SAHM.

if your parents give you money, if you're a doctor, or your husband gives you $0.50 off every dollar he makes

otherwise, dont be a stay at home mother

1285,MensRights,"we all know how feminism wants to claim women are so ""objectified"" and all that and they want to say men are privileged and it's a man's world, stuff like that. they will say they're objectified while we get drafted in wars because we are literally considered disposable. and they'll say they're objectified after leaving a disaster first because of ""women and children"", since men are literally considered disposable. they'll say we are privileged despite nothing being truly catered to us. I get that feminism has some valid points, as does ""meninism"". I mostly advocate for egalitarianism over feminism or ""meninism"" but that's besides the point. 

point is, everybody in society views men, especially white men as ""privileged scum pos"". because society views us as so privileged they actively ignore anything truly wrong with how society treats us and hates us for being so ""privileged"" when arguably women are more privileged imo, but even then the whole concept of ""privilege"" is silly. I never have ever called someone ""privileged"" and as a whole I dont think anybody is really truly ""privileged"" in society unless you're a filthy rich corrupted elite. 

Anyway, the only people who will care about you are other men. men are supposed to be the care giver and anything that they deal with they're just told to man up or whatever. you're expected to care for others when others arent expected to care for you. even then, most men wont care about you either. most men only care about women, either for relationship purposes or to try to get sex or whatever but really, go around saying ""I'm a man and depressed"" or ""my wife abused me"", and see how little anybody cares.

1296,MensRights,"I am aware of this sub's rule about mentioning activity in other sub reddits but what happened to me in another sub is a reflection of what is happening to me in real life too.

In a sub that discusses moral issues I posted my opinion about abortion. My post was more in the form of a question as I am still unsure about how I feel about abortion. I was immediately attacked by dozens of people and I was downvoted into oblivion. I do not mind being downvoted as long as the person who downvotes me also explains why they disagree with me. 

But many people kept telling me that since I am a man I am not allowed to have an opinion about what 'women do with their bodies'.

As always I was polite in my replies and I did not even react when insulted in the most vicious and personal way. They went so far as to say that a fetus is just a parasite.

To my surprise a day later I was banned from the sub but I received a message from the moderators telling me that I had to apologise for being a bigot and for trolling. I decided to humour them and I apologised. They kept asking me to apologise again. Eventually they told me to send them no more messages.

What is so shocking is that it has become acceptable for men to be denied from expressing their opinion, let alone having a say in any action that involves women. 

In the case of abortion, men should also have a say. If a woman decides to abort a child I have had with her I think that my views should have some weight too.",1615400894

1321,MensRights,"I am currently writing a masters thesis on impulsivity and emotional regulation, a process underlying practically all mental illness, and I believe there are some important parallels to be drawn between these processes and the current climate of proposed female vulnerability that I think is worth sharing. 

It is first important to understand that we are machines constantly recognising environmental cues. These cues e.g. the sound of running water or the smell of a fast-food joint guide us toward beneficial resources such as food and water. Furthermore, cues such as the howl of a wolf guide us away from potential threats. Our dopaminergic reward system plays a really important role in regulating our behaviour directed toward these cues. Take the example of smelling the fast-food joint; the irresistible familiar smell guides you through the door and drives to purchase the divine greasy treat. Subconsciously, your brain has observed a cue and predicted a reward based on your previous behaviour toward the cue. Due to your brain’s correct prediction of the reward it releases a large amount of dopamine to help you remember your response (buying the burger) is a beneficial reaction to the cue. On the flipside, not buying a burger is likely to make you a bit sad as your brain incorrectly predicted the response to the cue and less dopamine than expected is released. 

Impulsive disorders such as OCD, substance, and behavioural addictions all stem from maladaptive responses to cues. In other words, a cue may have a much more substantial effect on cognition than it deserves. You can think of this as the snap of an opening can of lager to an alcoholic; an otherwise normal cue that is now tied to intense craving of alcohol. 

What has this got to do with women and their perception of safety? Well, being the plastic malleable creatures we are, our response to environmental cues can be learned from others. Most of us know to steer clear of a rattle snake without having any prior experience of its bite. This is the issue.

The continuous conversation about female safety has taught many young women to recognise men as a cue (especially in the presence of other cues such as the time of day) that something horrible will happen to them. This leads to maladaptive responses to the cue such as crossing the road, calling a friend, or getting in a taxi that results in… you guessed it – Nothing. The fact that nothing happens results in a nice dose of dopamine reaffirming their response to the cue no matter how unnecessary it was.

Why is this a problem? Men are unfairly being associated with horrible people and are being mass generalised as such. This is damaging not only for men but for the women who are conditioned into thinking that any man is after them. The only way we can counter this is through education. In a twist of narrative, I believe it is now time not to have a conversation with your son about how to make women feel safe but to educate feminists and others (men and women alike) who perpetuate a notion of constant murder and abuse toward women. It was never men telling women to be vigilant, dress a certain way or avoid the streets at night, that fearmongering came from within the feminist community that constantly reduces women to nothing more than perpetual victims.",1615565312

It seems that people have gotten sick of the ""not all men"" responses that inevitably show up when women's issues are being discussed, due to the inevitable ""all men are dangerous"" type of language that tends to be used when sexual harrassment and rape are being discussed.

In order to avoid that, they've shifted to saying ""too many women"", as in too many women have been harrassed, assaulted, and raped. Too many women face these problems on a regular basis for the problem to be ignored, too many women get harrassed on a regular basis to stay silent about it.

At first glance it seems to be a great idea, it addresses the real and serious problems that women face without condemning every man for it, and should help the discussions not devolve into the usual men vs women arguments.",1615535675

Some quotes:

""Boys are more likely than girls to die in their second decade of life ... But even more troubling, Blum’s team [found](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X1930062X) that boys suffered higher levels of physical violence, neglect and sexual abuse by adults than girls.""

""In [one study](http://unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV365-Gewirtz-Meydan%20and%20Finkelhor%202019.pdf) of 13,000 children age 17 and younger, three-quarters of the boys who reported being sexually victimized said the person who violated them was another child. ***In a little more than half those assaults, the violator was a girl.""***

""The overwhelming majority of male rape victims say that the person who violated them was another male, but ***most male victims of other kinds of sexual violence say they were violated by a female.***""

""When we convey to boys that unwanted touch is a serious issue of sexual assault only when it affects girls and not when it affects boys, we are sending a message that only girls’ bodies are worthy of protection.""

""As the trial approached, lawyers representing the school board asked the judge to prohibit Martin’s legal team from using certain terms in front of a jury: rape, aggravated rape, sexual battery, sexual assault.""

Finally a real gem:

""Lara Stemple ... told me that her efforts to bring attention to male victims — and to the surprisingly high rates of female perpetration of such violence — have at times triggered false accusations that she is aligned with men’s rights activists, who are known for anti-feminist and misogynistic language and ideology.""

Even in an article about sexual violence against boys, MRAs are ""misogynists"". God forbid aligning with them. That's the Washington Post to you.",1615532162

1389,MensRights,"I think it would be more accurate to say men AND women are responsible for shaping social norms. Of course, they're also subject to social norms, which will affect their role in shaping them.

In times of societal change, you will always find those who struggle with the new societal demands. Here, it seems that society is trying to shift away from sexism. Consequently, we're seeing a lot of people struggling with change. Some object to this change and are frustrated to discover that rejecting emerging norms does not foreclose their effects. So I think we're seeing attitudes and behaviors reflecting this frustration.

Frustration is understandable. It's also confusing because the source is not always clear. I sympathize with frustration, but we can't lose sight of the real issue: Is it reasonable for women to want a less sexist society, and are women using reasonable means to pursue one? Those who disagree with the first question will not accept any answer to the second one.

And I think this is how social change always leaves some people behind. Those who simply cannot concede the reasonableness of pursuing social justice ultimately reject all methods of doing so. But this doesn't prevent changes from affecting them, so frustration naturally follows. And though I sympathize with frustration, that doesn't really change anything. Pursuit of a reasonable and necessary social goal justifies the frustration it inevitably creates. Would it really make sense to prioritize things the other way?",1615511728

This subreddit highlights a lot of big issues, but I think we need to start doing more. We should have a pinned thread dedicated to killing misinformation surrounding men, and link changes that need to be made to fix many of the issues men face today. 

For example, women can't be charged with rape in the UK, women who force men to have sex with them aren't legally rapists, family court issues, paternity allowances, the lack of support for male domestic violence victims, the lack of funding towards suicide prevention for men, the high rates of suicide amongst men, amongst many other issues. We need to combat the hate speech against men, on whatever platform you see it on, and the best way we can do that is with facts and statistics highlighting the issues, and pointing out flaws in the arguments used to support the hate speech that is being said.

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? How did you weather the storm? What kind of an attorney did you use? I'm looking at basic employment law- but any advice would help.

Thanks.",1615630779

Here is the translation:

Kamaraj says he was supposed to deliver \*\*the food at 4:30PM\*\*. But \*\*he was 15 minutes late\*\*. The lady was already waiting at her door when he went to deliver. She took the food and placed it inside, on the table, \*\*just a feet away from the main door\*\*. 

She asks him to wait while she talks to the customer care. At this point, Kamaraj was worried and \*\*requests her not raise a complaint\*\*. In a rude manner, she refuses to pay the money and asks him to leave. \*\*He asks the lady to pay-up\*\*. Kamaraj then tells the lady to be polite and not to treat him like a slave. In reply, the lady acknowledges the delivery boy saying that \*\*he is indeed a slave\*\*. 

Kamaraj then takes the food and starts walking. Meanwhile, the \*\*lady grabs slippers and starts following him, then begins hitting him to snatch the food\*\*. To protect himself the boy pushes her hand. As a result her finger ring cuts her nose.

At the police station, the lady threatens him with names of big people. She swears that he will not allow him to escape. 

In the Video, Kamaraj can be seen crying and swears on his dead father that he is innocent. He says he is the only bread earner in the family. Roopesh Rajanna, a well wisher of Kamaraj proceeds to say that he has not eaten since the fateful day. Roopesh says He is poor and wants to die. He assures he will support Kamaraj.",1615611610

Deep down, somewhere under my skin, I was holding on to some seriously wrongheaded assumptions — ideas so ingrained I did not even notice them, ideas that rendered ***boys as something less than human.""***

1466,MensRights,"Interesting tidbit that got buried deep into page 35 of the report: 

&gt; While our initial analysis of overall rates of self-reported harassment and assault behaviors showed that perpetration did not differ in statistically significant ways by the gender of the respondent, this equivalence altered upon removal of the “sexist slurs” item from our definition of harassment. Upon removal of this variable, we see a marginally statistically significant trend suggesting that men are more likely to engage in behaviors of sexual harassment and assault as compared to women (27% of men vs. 21% of women, p=0.051).  

It's interesting that they try to also cherry-pick out the ""sexist comments"" part so that they could twist the numbers against men. However, even with their cherrypicking, they acknowledge a p-value of 0.051, which, as anyone who has ever taken a stats course could tell you, means that the difference is not statistically significant with a standard significance level of 0.05. So in the end, they failed to find that harassment and assault is a gendered offense in terms of perpetration.

1484,MensRights,"This is just new theory I've been thinking upon and wanted to get some feed back. While we do have our extreme sexist people on both end of the spectrum, my focus is on the people in the middle of the bell curve. Most people in this group, are they really sexist or are they selfish. If their gender were all of a sudden changed would they still believing in the same things as they did before or would they switch sides to whatever that would serve their needs &amp; be most beneficial to them. 

I started thinking more about this since I've been seeing the #Notallmen tag 

And I'm a guy who had been harassed by females before but didn't really speak up on it because men just shrug it off. 

Quite recently I invited a girl over &amp; she wanted to have sex. I was into her but didn't feel like having sex so I made sure I was drunk that it was whiskey D. She kept trying to push us to have sex the entire night and ran around flashing on me &amp; doing things to provoke me. I kept thinking that this is weird. Switch roles I'd be in trouble. She apologized to me the next day.

The moral of the situations that I've been in &amp; #Notallmen is that - this is more of a power dynamic. If women had the power they'd be doing the same &amp; I've experienced this first hand. I'm not submissive guy at all but I've been groped on first dates, hit on my face on first dates (in a flirty manner but I don't like it), pressured for intercourse. If women had more power and physical prowess we would see more of this across the board. Which kind of brings back to my main point that this is more of a power dynamic to the vast majority of people &amp; individuals being selfish. Open to thoughts.",1615588598

I was the nearest guy to the door so they came up to me with a mic and asked me my name and how old I was etc etc. I did not expect what was coming up so I just played along. 

Few questions in and she asks me what my sexual orientation is. So I replied I'm a straight male and this person looked at the camera and gave a disgusted look and laughed. That threw me off a little but I let it slide. 

Then she asked me if I had a girlfriend to which I replied yes.  Then comes the weird part. She asks me, ""did you ever hit her."" What the actual fuck? I replied ""No I have never hit her and I never will."" So she went on to ask ""have you ever thought of hitting her?"" This is where I decided to draw the line so I replied ""no, and I'm not going to reply to anymore of your absurd questions, so please leave me alone."" They still didn't stop and started saying stuff like ""that's what someone who hits women would say,"" and ""are you a predator in your free time?""

I told them I wasn't comfortable being filmed so they should leave me alone. They still didn't stop. They started saying ""this is exactly why we call men pigs"" and other similar stuff. Then she ended the video and the whole tone just changed. She became completely polite and said ""we're just filming a feminist video for our project. Sorry if you felt harrassed or anything like that.""

Then she said ""don't worry, I'll blur your face, no one will recognize you."" as they fucking sprinted out of the train when the doors opened.

1520,MensRights,"So I saw a twitter post today with a few thousand likes and it was talking about how Gay men are included when women say, 
'we don't feel safe around men,'
The OP then went on to reference her being harassed by gay men  which is valid and is an issue that should be talked about...
However she then went on to say that gay men still have male privilege and well... um...
Let me just quote it,
""Y’all have still grown up with male privilege, you’ve been socialised to believe you’re more important and have more power than us and that doesn’t go away because you suck dick lol.""

Now, I would really like you to tell me how I, a gay guy, was socialised to believe I'm more important than women.
Was it the feeling of estrangement in school cause I grew up feeling isolated from everyone cause I was 'weird and different'?? 
Was it me thinking there was something wrong with me? Oh no, it was definitely having no male friends, right?

I think it shows that people will bring 'male privilege' into an argument to make them sound like they're being reasonable but they're not when they clearly haven't thought about who actually has the privilege. The only people with male privilege are the privileged.
Joe from down the street who's a plumber isn't privileged.
The CEO of a company is actually privileged. Rich privileged people have the upper hand in society, they have influence, your average dad doesn't. 

This is my first post here so it's probably not well thought out or anything. I just felt confused as to why someone would make a post that was causing man hating against the people who are meant to be your allies.


Also, many gay men in the comments spoke about their experiences with being harassed by straight women and guess what.

Whenever I see people mention how many men kill women, about sexism in the police, I want to explain that more men are victims of violence from strangers, and that the criminal system is hugely skewered in favour of women, not against them. Not that sentencing is the same as policing but you get my point.

So I saw a new post from TheTinMen and it got me thinking about the tragic case of Emmett Till. What if feminism is in some ways another lever that can be or is used to reinforce white supremacy, systemic racism and police brutality?

 Think about it. By breeding distrust of men and avoidance of them, you create or influence stereotypes that they are dangerous. If you create that stereotype of dangerous men, you potentially create a criminal bias against them, especially towards men of color. This bias impacts average people, law enforcement and the courts who will treat false allegations as truth and proceed accordingly. After all, that's essentially what happened to Emmett Till. He was falsely accused by a woman and the men who murdered him got off because they believed they were serving justice to a ""perpetrator.""

What I think MRA means is calling out what feminists believe to be true and to call out the bad things that they do in the guise of “social justice”. 

The reason I joined MRA was because I began to understand the harm that feminism is doing on young boys and how it is just wrong that men are being treated unfairly in family court, school and society in general. I came to this realization in high school when I had a teacher give all of her attention to the girls in the class to help them succeed and punish the boys with extra homework and an unfair grading standard. I didn’t realize at first but later in the term I figured it out as it seemed that we had to do more work for no extra reward and it just seemed weird that my female classmates loved her but my male classmates and I absolutely HATED her. It came down to her projecting her home life on the students. I am now almost out of college so it was a long time since then but I still remember it like it was yesterday. 

It is just shitty that women are allowed and encouraged to be sexist and racist and just down right psycho but if a man does any of that it is a crime in the public court. I just love reading tweets calling to “kill all men” or to “teach men to be better”. If I replaced man with woman I would be dragged all over the internet and my life would be absolutely ruined. I have seen it happen with many people even men I know. For example a friend, let’s call him John went to a party with some really popular girls and proceeded to hook up with one of them will call Jane. After the party Jane regretted sleeping with him and wished she didn’t. Her friends told her that she could claim it was rape and encouraged her to report him to the school. Luckily for John, she never went through with it as she knew that it was consensual. She told that to her friends and they said that if she didn’t report him, they would. First of all it is extremely inappropriate to tell someone what they want when it isn’t even true. So the friend who will call Amy told the school that John raped her friend Jane and she wanted to tell you but felt she couldn’t. Again, John got lucky that Jane told the school and the police that she didn’t say that and that John didn’t rape her and it was consensual. Why do I mention this? Because it is just one of the many ways that feminists hurt us guys and that it would be so wrong for a man to do. 

I simply don’t understand how people think that it is ok to be sexist to men and racist towards white people as if reverse racism isn’t real. It just sickens me to see society turn its back towards men. Judge not by the sex of the person but by the content of their character.",1615692592

1569,MensRights,"I feel like there's a trend in young men and even men my age that are proud that they don't jackoff.

I'm 100% against no nut November and any push for men to ""Stop watching porn"" while using an excuse that it desensitizes men when it doesn't. Don't fall into this trap that it fucks you up or that it makes you a poor lover or that watching porn is bad for you. 

Abstaining from sex or masturbating to say generally ""Getting off"" Fucks with your hormones' and has never been proven in any study to be good for you, and there's also been no link to any porn (not talking about habitual) and how you interact with women. 

Regular ejaculation has been proven to be good for prostate health. 

Porn addiction is porn addiction, that falls under a completely other category and I'm not talking about that. But to say that pornography or masturbating desensitizes men is a campaign against us. If you also look at the roots of NNN it comes from 4Chan.  

The hypocrisy comes from the side that uses vibrators that oscillate at 10,000 Hz and dildos that are built for horses. I can always tell when a woman uses a vibrator as they are the ones that self proclaimed they ""Never cum"" with men. If I attached a pocket pussy to a jackhammer I'd have a hard time cumming as well with a woman.",1615671447

1571,MensRights,"I wanted to share this story, I created a throwaway account because I don’t trust putting this on my main account.

I live in the U.K. where in the news there’s been stories of the tragic murder of a woman. 

Anyway my girlfriend who lives with me ordered some baking supplies from a local shop as she was making a cake for Mother’s Day for her mum in our coronavirus bubble, she asked me to pick them up this evening.

I got in my car to the bakers shop to pick up the yeast and some fresh flour and pay for them. Inside the bakers shop was two women who work there, it was dark outside at this time, I enter the shop and said I came to pick up an order for my GF placed.

One of the women looked at me and spoke to the other women and whispered, one of the women went out the back and I was expecting her to bring the stuff we ordered so I could pay and leave. 

But I was kinda shocked when the other woman told me that she wouldn’t serve me as her friend who was now at the back of the shop didn’t feel comfortable with me there due to my “over bearing masculine presence” and said they’d call the police if I didn’t leave.

I respected their decision and left as I was more afraid at this point they may make up I did something when I never, I have no idea what I did wrong, I’m a rather tall and fat male but I did nothing to make them feel unsafe at all.

My girlfriend was furious and called the owner as she knows them (a couple) who deeply apologised and said the younger girl was new and with everything going on in the news it’s to be expected. 

I guess no harm done, but this is the first and hopefully last time I was refused service because I presume of my gender. My girlfriend is still furious!

Edit: for anyone wondering I went to Morrison’s instead and the lovely baker guy there gave me some fresh yeast for free and bought some flour!",1615670935

i think it has more to do with men feeling need to be breadwinner, so entering crime world. 

and as for victims-well if most gang members are male for eg...but also bcos i think men and women accept that violence against men is normal. whereas against women is a taboo. 

what do you guys think and importantly what are solutions??

1590,MensRights,"tl;dr: Against popular opinion men more likely to be killed walking down the street; men get sexually harassed too; many posts on social media in the UK atm is a false and dangerous narrative calling for curfews for men and for men to ""teach their sons"" yet this is baseless slander

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, a woman by the name of Sarah Everard went missing, a week later her body was found and a UK Policeman has been arrested for her murder. This is a horrible situation and I hope the guy who did it rots in jail. Following this, there has been a massive campaign over social media and the media claiming statistics such as 97% of women have been sexually harassed and that there should be a curfew for men and that men need to teach their sons. This was quite a lot to take in and at first, I was just going to just get on with my day but since some friends asked my opinion, I decided to look into it a bit.

Firstly, it should be understood that statistics can be easily twisted to argue any point so take everything including what I have said with a pinch of salt, investigate things for yourself and make your own opinions.

Where I have used data, it is from the [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/appendixtableshomicideinenglandandwales) by the UK government which has data about murder over the last 10 years. I used data for the year 2018-19 chosen by random however while researching, I realised I could choose data from 2017-18 which would support my arguments even better but decided against it as I don't want to cherry-pick data like other groups do.

For instance, [Femicide Census](https://www.femicidecensus.org/) report that 62% of women are killed by men are from a current or former partner as it fits their narrative at that moment. Recently, women are now claiming that they are killed mainly while walking down the street by random men. So which is true? Through the data, it says that women killed by a current or former partner are around 30%. That is quite a significant difference to a point where I can't even explain how they got that number.

Have you heard about Kieran Campbell? He is a 13-year old boy and he went missing the same day as Sarah (3rd March) and thankfully was found 6 days later however in all that time, I saw nothing from social media or the media except for this [News Story](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/keiran-campbell-missing-boy-brixton-b922875.html) which contains more information about Sarah's disappearance yet in no news story on Sarah have I seen information about Kieran. Why the difference?

Looking more into the stats I found:

1. 422 men killed; 225 women killed
   1. of which for men killed, 52% from someone they didn't know
   2. of which for women killed, 35% from someone they didn't know
   3. So women saying they're killed by random men just for simply walking down the street is a lot less likely than they are implying, it is far more likely they know the guy AND it is more likely men get killed for walking down the street by someone random
2. Looking at where people have been killed, residential vs public places in percentage: Male 43:57 Women 78:22
   1. Therefore, men are far more likely than women to be killed on the street
   2. Women are much more likely to be killed in a home than in a public place (just walking down the street) which is against their current narrative
3. A bit off the topic but for the suspects of these murders:
   1. Female suspects are more likely to NOT be convicted of murder, 30% of women aren't convicted of murder whereas 20% of men aren't convicted
   2. Of those convicted; 71% of men get life imprisonment whereas only 48% of women get life imprisonment for their murder
   3. So basically, women are REALLY unlikely to be killed by a stranger on the street, yet men are more likely and spoke about less.

Enough of statistics, let’s just use some good old logic:

1. There has been a call for men to be given a curfew of 6 pm to ""protect women""
   1. The thing is, if you single out one group and give them a curfew that is quite horrific, but you can say it about men? A good tool I use is can you change gender for another identifier, will it still be okay to say? Think race, LGBTQ+ etc
   2. Think about the number of people men save, men are the massive majority of jobs working for public protection, think police, fire, army etc.
2. The 97% experience some kind of sexual harassment... 
   1. I'm not going to invalidate someone’s personal experience although many posts on social media claiming that men do not experience sexual harassment is invalidating our experiences... ironic right?
   2. I find that stat quite insane, I can't tell if it's accurate or not, but I do have important questions:
      1. What counts as sexual harassment? I've heard some people say ""being stared at by a male"" counts? More often than not, the dude was probably just daydreaming on the bus
      2. How did they get this data, did they interview random women on the street?
   3. I think that men also get sexually assaulted quite a lot but don't realise it. Think about a man flashing a woman, that's sexual assault. Now a woman flashing a man, will he if interviewed say he was sexually assaulted? Me personally, I have been touched inappropriately by women on multiple occasions non-consensually (grabbing my butt and rolling their hand up to my inner thigh) and I also been cat-called (which was odd) but I never really thought I has been sexually assaulted until I considered it the other way round. So I wonder what % of men have been sexually assaulted? And if so, I don't think we should be teaching boys to not sexually harass women, we should be teaching our children to understand boundaries and respect everyone.
3. ""Teach sons to respect women""... So, this is going to be quite controversial. But boys raised by singles mothers tend to be more likely to grow up and commit crime including harassing women. So surely women aren't even teaching their sons? And moreover can be inferred that men ARE teaching their sons and women are not? Now this is maybe a bit too much of a blanket statement, I believe anyone raised in a single-parent household can grow up and do amazing things and won't become criminals, but I think it is something worse considering.
4. Commonly, we are told that men are normalising rape due to making rape jokes. I thought about this, I have not ever heard a rape joke about women and only ever heard about rape jokes about men dropping the soap in the prison shower. So I decided to search ""rape joke"" on YouTube and what I found was many many videos of women making some kind of speech saying rape jokes are bad, a video of a man affected by prison rape jokes as he had experienced it, a comedian making jokes about how saying jokes about rape are taboo and an American Dad clip which did contain a rape joke. I decided to take this further and asked people to ""tell me a rape joke"", no one I have asked can think of one except for the prison shower one... so please tell me a rape joke because I don't know if it is a thing?

So, all in all, what's going on right now on social media is perplexing. But here's the great thing about social media, you can turn it off.

For those who feel a bit upset that there is a massive smearing campaign against men, please I urge you to forget about it as it is not going to affect your life at all once you just close the app. Focus on your professional career and what makes you happy. You are all kings and deserve happiness.",1615661392
1591,MensRights,"(I appreciate any views on this, but mostly I just want to open my mouth and complain about this situation and spread the word that this kind of misandry exists)

tl;dr: GF’s friend is complaining about men all the time and tries to manipulate her into breaking up with me, as she hates me too. GF doesn’t want to lose the others in the friend group, but I don’t like the idea of her hanging out with this toxic idiot.

My girlfriend has two social circles, other one being her friends from uni. One of her friends is really radical feminist, a lesbian and someone who proudly tells people ”she has no men in her life” (other than her dad?) **Red flag?**

Well, first I saw no problem in this, everyone has the freedom to an opinion. But now that I know the way she talks… My GF and her friends have been meeting in our aparment for some time now and I have to listen to them. At first I was happy cause I wanted to meet new people. Lately I have been distancing myself from them, for a reason:

This one girl complains about men (and straight people) literally *all the fucking time*. If they are watching TV: ”who there’s so many men in this series”, ”that male character is stupid”. If they’re talking about studies: ”this male professor is really racist and sexist and…” If they’re talking about politics or feminism: ”fuck all men”, ”are you implying that men matter?” (ironic joke, or is it?), ”men are rapist pigs”. I know she has asked the lecturer if she can change groups because she doesn’t want to work with men, ofc she worded it in a way that it’s *men* who are always harassing her. She has also demanded that her essays must be double checked if the professor is a male. Great…!

I have also heard her complaining about me, she probably didn’t realize I was home lol. Apparently I’m *mansplaining* if I discuss things with them (even tho I mostly agree with them on many issues). I don’t understand the world, can’t handle emotions (what???), and I listen to ”mens fantasy music full of rape and whores” (she went thru my vinyl collection lol). Of course I have been furious at my GF for allowing her to talk like that in our home.

My GF told me she has also suggested breaking up with me (for no reason?), and that my GF should take precautions because I might hurt her or rape her. Nice…

Apparently this woman is a central person in this social circle, and my GF is afraid to talk about this issue. The others in this group are not as radical, most of them being quite ”normal” people I would say… My GF ofc wants to keep these friends, as she doesn’t want to study alone. She also fears that she might become a target for bullying or something, for example they already know shes not as left wing as they are and she gets some shit for this.

**My feelings:** to put it shortly: I don’t want my partner to hang around toxic people who want to manipulate them and who apparently hate me for being a male. We’re afraid that if she doesn’t want to be with them anymore they will accuse me of being a manipulator or something, or accuse her of something else.",1615657644

&gt;""It hurts, i'm just tired of it all, I want to hug my mom"".  


*I was having an anxiety attack*

Thankfully, talking to a friend actually helped.  


**Why?**

I didn't know why, but I was feeling very attacked by all these posts surrounding the tragic death of Sarah Evarard. I sat in the shower for two hours and was recollecting my thoughts. I decided to call a friend, and while trying to talk, I just burst out crying. I realized that I felt like I was once again living in the moment I was *falsely accused*. It felt like my victim hood was being stripped away because I was a man. (I may have been oversensitive about it, flame me or whatever) 

The only reason why after a whole year, I could talk to women again, is because another individual told me 'not all woman are monsters' and that was the self realization that my generalization of individuals to their group identity was dangerous. 

**But this isn't about you.**

It really isn't. I'm glad that a lot of woman are sharing their experiences and shedding a new light on what they had to experience on a daily basis. While I knew it was an issue, I didn't think the scale of it would be this large. So I do agree that women face the adversary of needing to be worried walking alone in the streets and it is a fair assumption for them to think the man behind her is a perpetrator. 

And yet, I felt alienated, unwanted and once again, I found myself fearing women. So I decided to look at it more constructively.

The conversation is about the struggle of being a woman needing to take more taxi rides than required. **It is a real issue.** But does generalizing men, comparing us to ticks and even setting rules; not set a negative tone towards men? It feels more like 'men are the issue' than any solution really. 

**I'm no expert in stats**

I don't care really. While most post seem to always try to cater to stats towards making one community oppressed, I am certain of one thing, and that is my group identity does not define who tf I am. 

**What's next?**

Next step for a solution to the issue is ""What can we as every individual him/her/itself can do?"" rather than ""What men should do"" because I really don't think that pushes the conversation forward. 

What do you guys think?",1615803516

So, a lot of people know that radical femenists like to spread the lie that ""Women earn 20% less than men for the same job"" , or some percentage of wage indifference. However, I thought of an argument which *should* shut down a lot of liars.

Here's my example :

Jim works in an office. He earns some amount of money a year from his boss. One day, Jim decides that he wants to become transgender, so he goes to the hospital and has the surgery. Now Jim is sexually identified as a woman, and goes by the name Lauren. The next day, Lauren goes back to *her* job in the office. ( Now, under the equal employment act, Lauren's boss cannot change *her* pay even if they have decided to change a part of their body. ) Lauren goes to her desk, when the boss walks over : ""Sorry, Lauren, but you're a woman now. That means I have to pay you 20% less of your wages. I know you understand"".

Now, here's the argument : Would that scenario ever happen in real life? Lauren is a woman, which means she *should* be paid 20% less, but that exchange between Lauren and *her* boss would never happen, because it's illogical. So, for that reason, it proves that woman aren't paid less for the same job, as that conversation would never take place.",1615803146

This has been hailed as 'police not protecting women' and there is a lot of talk about there being too many women being killed by men and [women matter less than cars](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-56392007), and no one is talking about men.

I did a little research on the [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2020) website and saw a very different picture.

' The increase in homicide between the year ending March 2015 and year ending March 2018 reflected a 50% rise in the number of male victims, which increased from 319 in the year ending March 2015 to 479 in the year ending March 2018. Over the same period the number of female victims increased from 184 to 219 (19% increase).'

A little more reading supports the idea that more men than women are victims of homicide in the UK:

' In the latest year, there has been a 20% increase in the number of male victims (422 to 506). Conversely, the number of female victims fell by 16% (from 225 to 188), the first decrease since year ending March 2016'

Why is it that only women are being talked about. It wouldn't make sense if the ratio of male and female victims was 50% to only talk about women but it's not, it's worse for men.",1615761176

Yet another unnecessary false rape case suicide in India. Yet another man lost a life because men aretreated like shit in this shit hole of a nation. A nation where men are not allowed to speak about harassment and abuse by law. Only chance they get to speak is in suicide notes when it’s too late.

Feminists claim false accusations are an ‘inconvenience’ for men. It has been proven time and again that number of false accusations is higher than the number of proven rape cases. It has been proven that a mere accusation can ruin a mans life. Not only ruin it can lead to suicide. Yet the issue is ‘very minor’ according to feminists and should be ignored. It was in 2013 that the Indian government had decided to setup gender neutral laws when it comes to rape and harassment complaints but feminist organisations protested against it and we still have laws that state only men can rape, only men can be sexual assaulters.

This is also coming during the time when the High Court of Delhi said “[Fake cases of sexual harassment a trend](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/fake-cases-of-sexual-harassment-a-trend-delhi-high-court-7224556/)”.

1674,MensRights,"A manchild is essentially a man with means (or who has the potential to earn a decent living) who focuses on himself instead of on women and starting a family.  Such a man is seen as selfish and immature.  And this is because the default expectation is that he should settle down, get married, and have children.  His money isn't seen as belonging to him, and his happiness isn't taken as a priority.  People instead think about all the women out there who could take his money and spend it on themselves and their happiness. But can't because he's too busy spending it on things he wants to do.

According to at least one article about this, some of the signs of a manchild include,

* ""Talk of children or commitment brings panic to his eyes.""

* ""He avoids serious conversation"" meaning he changes the topic when you try to convince him to marry you or have kids with him.

* ""His interests and friendships carry a middle-school vibe."" In other words he likes to have fun instead of getting serious about that marriage and children thing everyone wants him to do.

The default, gynocentric view, is that this is harmful to women.  That these men who are living their lives for themselves, and not for women and children, are doing something wrong.  And the articles you see about this definitely take that approach. 

The message is that a proper, mature man does everything he can for women.  Including handing over his money so she can live in a big house, possibly have kids with him, and then not have to work a job anymore.

Society condemns and criticizes men who don't do this, which I don't think is fair.  If women are strong and independent then we shouldn't be shaming men into being providers and ""good husbands"" for them.  Let him have his hobbies and spend his money how he deems appropriate.

1682,MensRights,"Trying to not be long winded here, but this is bugging me to no end....

One regular argument we hear from feminists and women's rights activists is how women must fear being raped by a random man on the street.  Our typical reply is along the lines of men are 3 times more likely to be violently assaulted including murder, more so by a stranger.  Which is imperially true.

So this extremely sad and unfortunate murder of Sarah Everard is showing the true colors of feminism, what happened to her IS A MALE ISSUE.  She was murdered, not raped or kidnapped, she was murdered, the very thing we as men show is a real problem for us at triple the rate of women.  So a male victim dominated crime happens to a women and it's all about women.  The issue/murder has been hijacked and turned political.

This is something we can not let happen, or allow the opposite to happen either when something exceptional happens to us.  We must speak up and point out this victim championing.  The media is not helping of course and we can't really contact them, so it's important we point out what happened to Sarah is the very thing we, men, are expressing we have to worry about, being murdered at triple the rate.  

The women's right movement is taking something that is a primary male issue to the degree of triple the rate, and taking a single instance and claiming the entire problem is not only theirs, but using it to place blame.  This is not productive for them or us, it helps no one because it's changing the narrative of who the victims *usually are* which takes focus off a problem and shifts it to a smaller one.

Please, speak up.  Please make note this is the exact issue we are bringing up when women bring up walking down the street in fear of rape, men have to worry about exactly what happened to Sarah and it falls on deaf ears regularly.  Use this as an example of something that happens to men more than women, women are not excluded from it, Sarah Everard is your example, and express how there are issues that happen to women more than men, but do still happen to men.

We need to take the high road here and use Sarah Everard's untimely death as something for progress, positivity, and unity instead of adding fuel to the hate and blame fire with silly arguments and being defensive.  Let's be positive and use this as a mutual point to talk, not a contentios point to argue.",1615747812

'' With the cooperation of the police agency of a small metropolitan community, 45 consecutive, disposed, false rape allegations covering a 9 year period were studied. These false rape allegations constitute 41% of the total forcible rape cases (n = 109) reported during this period. These false allegations appear to serve three major functions for the complainants: providing an alibi, seeking revenge, and obtaining sympathy and attention. False rape allegations are not the consequence of a gender-linked aberration, as frequently claimed, but reflect impulsive and desperate efforts to cope with personal and social stress situations.''

Hey guys,

I'm writing an article on how feminists use gaslighting to control the narrative. I've developed four main categories:

1. Spinning Men's Issues as Misogyny

This one is relatively straightforward. You know how if you try to bring attention to men's problems you're somehow immediately labeled Anti-Woman. Even if the issue at hand has nothing to do with women at all, like circumcision or the draft.

2. Questioning Your Masculinity and Sexuality

This is when you bring up a men's rights issue and are immediately labeled an incel, virgin or small penis. Perfect example of gaslighting. Your complaints aren't valid because they stem from insecurity.

3. Changing the Definition of Words

How feminists suddenly claim you can't be sexist against men or play no true scotsman with the term ""feminist."" I'd call this gaslighting because it takes something we all accept as true but tries to make you out to be incorrect over semantics.

4. Denying the Evidence of Your Eyes and Ears

This is the most fundamental. When feminists try to claim men's lives are more valued than women's, even though we all grew up in a world where it's the opposite. It could be claims that ""women and children first"" is a myth or that women are the primary victims of war, things anyone who's lived in the real world knows is ridiculous.

Anyway, I'd really like some examples of these methods of gaslighting from online sources. These could be tweets or Tumblr quotes or even professionally published articles. These concrete examples would really help me round out the article.

That's regrettable because I strongly feel that in the longer term exactly the media aspect will be the case's true legacy.

What I see currently is a mass hysteria triggered by the broadcast and social media's treatment of the case. What I see is the unrestrained and uninhibited exploitation of an in and by itself anomalous case, no matter how tragic. When such a case is weaponized for political purposes, especially when the purpose is to extract changes in legislation and public policy, the result can lead or at least contribute to an unmitigated disaster. It would be better if cooler heads prevailed than to risk such a disaster.

The Sarah Everard case is completely atypical. Kidnapping a woman from a street is extremely rare both in the UK and elsewhere. Crime statistics are dropping for decades, and, at least in the US, are at a record low. Men are the main targets of violent crime, 75 - 80% of violent attacks are against men (US data). Moreover the overwhelming majority of victims of homicides by a stranger are men, while women are killed more often by people they know. So women are much, much safer walking down a street than men. But these facts never bother extremists and the propagandists serving them. What they want is the weaponization of a single atypical case, and anecdotes are used the same way.

This how propaganda is made:

The propagandists (in this case feminists and women who approve of them) pick atypical cases or anecdotes, and hype them up by the media that, regrettably, they control. Then they use them as bludgeons to extort female-friendly and anti-male legislation and policies. When there is no atypical single case or anecdote, they just make one up. Like in 1992, when they published an entirely manufactured ""study"" claiming that ""schools shortchange girls"", when it wasn't true then as it is not true now. The ""study"" got hyped up in headlines in the MSM which never performed any reality check about it. The hype resulted in a faux moral panic about ""shortchanged"" girls. This panic led to legislation in 1994, the Gender Equity Education Act (GEEA) that is still not repealed even though it is clearly proven to be based on a falsehood. The genesis of this piece of legislation perfectly illustrates the process from anecdote/atypical case to hype to faux moral panic to ill-conceived legislation that goes counter to all available facts and data, and even counter to reason.

The success of such a tactic convinces the propagandists of the tactic's effectiveness. Rightly so, because despite its immorality it produces the intended results, regardless how sinister those results may be. From this point on the propagandists don't want to waste a single suitable ""crisis""  without turning it into an opportunity for hatred and extortion. If there isn't a ""crisis"", they fabricate one.

What I sense as danger in this case is that the seductive power of a perfect ""opportunity"" to enact policy changes or legislation might prevail, again, leading to even more baseless hatred against men, even more misandry than what we already face, with the appropriate policy consequences. Think of the ill-fated comment of a British MP about imposing a 6 p.m. curfew on men, and the wide acceptance it immediately received. Not universal acceptance but a wide one. Many pieces circulated pondering the practical use and justification of such a curfew, until even broader disapproval forced the MP to retroactively proclaim it a joke - in typical retroactive feminist fashion.  It is just not very believable that a British MP would be joking in the middle of a national uproar about a murder. It stands to reason that she was serious about it and meant every word. Then think of the consequences if it had been taken seriously and implemented. That's what ""ill-conceived"" means, and the unethical use of propaganda is the fastest way to ill-conceived policies.

1752,MensRights,"A lot has been said and written about the Sarah Everard case, except about one aspect of it: the broadcast and social media reactions to it which barely got any coverage. That's regrettable because I strongly feel that in the longer term exactly the media aspect will be the case's true legacy.

What I see currently is a mass hysteria triggered by the broadcast and social media's treatment of the case. What I see is the unrestrained and uninhibited exploitation of an in and by itself anomalous case, no matter how tragic. When such a case is weaponized for political purposes, especially when the purpose is to extract changes in legislation and public policy, the result can lead or at least contribute to an unmitigated disaster. It would be better if cooler heads prevailed than to risk such a disaster.

The Sarah Everard case is completely atypical. Kidnapping a woman from a street is extremely rare both in the UK and elsewhere. Crime statistics are dropping for decades, and, at least in the US, are at a record low. Men are the main targets of violent crime, 75 - 80% of violent attacks are against men (US data). Moreover the overwhelming majority of victims of homicides by a stranger are men, while women are killed more often by people they know. So women are much, much safer walking down a street than men.

So I noticed something recently that I found quite nasty, two years ago, when I was 14, I was targeted by a paedophile who was two years older than me, he sent me some horrific messages, asking to touch me and stuff like that, as an autistic person, I got extremely scared, and it's meant I can't use public toilets without getting scared.

He tracked me down on Facebook, about a year ago, then about a two weeks ago he contacted me on Instagram, he was blocked, a couple of days ago he contacted my other Instagram account, and was blocked again, when he was 16, he also asked a 12 year old girl for sex. far the police have done nothing.

I noticed my mum sharing some posts on Facebook which say things like, "" I'm raising a son your daughter will be safe with,"" then taking about my encounter with the Pedo.

I feel like I was used to prove a point about how men can't be trusted and almost have to be indoctrinated to behave correctly, I've seen many of my mums friends posting the same picture, I feel like I was used then thrown to the side.

Why is it though whenever boys/men have these kinds of issues, it's as if we're always used to prove some sort of point?

I told her yes women are valued on beauty and men are valued on what they bring to the table (job, money, etc).

1776,MensRights,"So hey,
 I have been on social media and hearing a lot of posts about woman being discriminated ( which is disgusting and should never happen). I assume this is because if the Sarah Everand murder (again hope the perpetrator rots in jail) . However the backlash against men in general is extremely worrying.

----So let me get something straight----
 I FULLY SUPPORT the movement tk encourage safety for women and making the streets safer.

However I have been recently seeing posts that have said #k*llallmen and people suggesting that men should have a curfew. 
And some posts I have seen on insta (by @feepaints the one with nearly 400k likes) have truly got we worried. Whilst posts makes some excellent points I feel as if it has some serious flaw/ overlooked points. The final line on this post was ""Not all men but probably You""
Excuse me what. So a small percentage of men (who should be ashamed) who do this suddenly represents the entire male gender. If anything it wants to make me cry thinking that now I am = to the people who commit such atrocities. How can people be so insensitive to the fact that males have emotions to say something so demonising.
To demonstrate its stupidity some of their statements sound I'd like to show you what happens when we substitute a race / religion into that same statement (""not all men but enough to be scared of all men"").

""Not all (insert race) people (insert crime), but enough to be scared of all (insert race) people.""

Imagine if someone on social media posted that. That would basically be a speedrun of getting cancelled lmao.

And before I round off I'd like to lead you to the insta post from earlier (@feepaints). It quotes ""men who are really scared of being falsely accused"" are apparently part of the problem. Now this is BS. Now it's only a small amount of women who falsely accuse. But according to their ideology it doesn't matter if its a small % of women who do, I should be scared of all of them . Sounds dumb right? Cos it is.

Finally I would like to say. I love the idea of equality but does preventing discrimination against one group  require  the need to discrimate against an other? No. This is one way to take an organisation/ cause which I fully support with all my heart and then absolutely discredit everything they said and make them seem downright stupid.

If there are 2 people who had children together. Partner 1 cuts down on his career to support partner the kids. Now partner 2 has a life long obligation to support partner 1 financially. It is because, if partner 1 did not compromise on his career for them both, he could have been much better financially. (I am using he as a universal pronoun here could be a she) And partner 1, indirectly through childcare, contributed financially and is entitled to a share in their combined income.

If one employs a baby sitter or cook one has to pay them. Partner 1 took up that role for free.

Even after a divorce, even if partner 1 is self sufficient, his career has still been set back by several years due to compromises involved in childcare. So a lifelong alimony, seems just.

There is a famous married couple, husband and wife. The wife is an international sportswoman and the husband took care of children and household so she could proceed in her career. In case she divorces him, he deserves a share in her money, by right.

This topic was discussed before but most people here felt alimony shouldn't be a lifelong deal. But if partner 1 could have been a ceo, but is instead in a significantly lesser position thanks to career compromises, isn't compensation warranted in the event of divorce?",1615828128
1791,MensRights,"The first incident that made me question my own feminist label was this incident in India

A female actress and celebrity named kangana ranaut in India claimed that Hrithik Roshan, a famous and beloved celebrity and  a married man courted her but made sure she was not given a role in his movie after their break up.

Hrithik filed a defamation case against her but media took kangana's side. Even after facts revealed themselves, kangana was respectfully invited everywhere to shit on hrithik. The facts of this case are bizarre because kangana literally made up a relationship. Here is what investigation revealed   


1.kangana did not submit ANY proof and refused to submit even her own laptop and phone to the police. She had no practical proof for a 4 year affair (or 7?)

2.Hritik submitted his phones and laptops and police traced their activity. Hritik contacted kangana 4 times in the entire duration of the alleged affair. Police actually declared that they are convinced hritik is innocent

3.Kangana only wrote mails to an a/c that was traced to usa, was probably a catfisher using hritik's name. Or else ya hritik was at 2 places at the same time!

4.hritik's passport had no stamps of foreign travel to paris(?) where allegedly he proposed to kangana

5. Mails where kangana obsessively stalked hritik, even admitting he never talks to her were sent from kangana's mail id to hritik's (kangana said hritik hacked her a/c and sent those mails to himself..!.)

6. Kangana's team tried photoshopping images from a party to prove an affair. Hrithik's ex wife (wife at the time of the alleged affair) came out in Hrithik's support and revealed original photos in which bollywood celebrities were all partying and she was present along with hrithik in that party.

If kangana were male media would have CHEWED her but is hypocritically silent ONLY because she is a woman.

Also when her ex adhyayan suman came forward bravely to reveal that kangana was abusive people made fun of him, something that would never happen to women. 

This is to not say that women in India donot get abused. But there are 2 sides to every coin.

A similar case happened in south korea kim hyung joon. His ex falsely accused him of abuse and dragged him down.

But I also have a feeling that men are being harmed a lot worse mentally and physically than most people know. We are still at the point where most people believe that men cannot even be victims of violence in M/F relationships let alone need help. 

Feminists have been denying women's role in domestic abuse even though several studies have come out shedding a light on it. You still see feminists trying to discredit these studies which leads me to believe that they weren't done by feminists, why would they?

We didn't have a perfect relationship (who does?), we had problems but it was nothing like she describes at all.

That she was a typical covert narc working the situation exactly like they always do (completely eliminating or mitigating any wrongdoing she has done from her narrative and magnifying my wrongdoing to the umpteenth degree by adding dramatic flair and lies onto the truth.). I was wondering if anyone else has ever gone through anything like this? Any advice? It's absolutely horrible that this is what so many men go through. The woman always being the victim. Always getting away with murder. Getting to go around telling lies and people believe her no matter what. I'm automatically the monster because I'm the guy. I'm untrustworthy and deserve to suffer forever because I'm terrible. It's really awful. I'm thinking of getting a lawyer to draft a cease and desist about this and even take her to civil court (I do have people that would vouch for me). I have screenshots of many of her lies and many of them are things that I can prove are lies if it was to be presented to a judge. What do you guys think?",1615939204

""Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast) argues that, despite women’s “strong advancement” since the law was enacted, “there are still several areas where women lag behind men … salary, senior management, decision-making roles in organizations including boards”. This was supported by Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong GRC), who pointed out that women are also financially more vulnerable after a divorce, urging caution against further moves to let other groups of men claim maintenance.""


What does it mean ? Does it mean that vulnerable men are forced to give maintenance to their ex wife ? Because if maintenance are given out of necessity, only men who are poorer than their ex-wife will get it. Men who are more vulnerable than their ex wife. So what those average salary or vulnerability have to do with that ? That doesn't make any sense. This just means F men.

1864,MensRights,"#Part I: Anthropological Analysis 

**Women are not sexually attracted to men.** They are disgusted by the male form, disgusted by our veiny musculature, and disgusted by our body hair. A man can never be attractive like a woman can. As you can imagine, this makes life unfairly difficult for men and unjustly easy for women. 

**If you are a woman, you will simply never understand what it’s like to be a man.** What it’s like to walk down the street in public. You will never understand how we are treated by society. Truly, you would not last a week as a male in 2021. 

Good, hard-working, well-deserving men are rejected and left to rot in loneliness for no other reason than simply because they were born male. For as far back as humanity goes, good decent men have been tortured in this way. You have twice as many female ancestors as you do male ancestors. That’s right, **women are twice as successful as producing offspring than men.** You might be thinking “what? that can’t be right!”. Just take for example this: say there are two men and two women. Each women has kids with one of the men. We can see in this example 100% of the women pass on their genes, but only 50% of the men do. 

Being born a man is like being born an anal beetle. Females are living life on easy mode, they will never have to struggle, and they will never have to fight. Females live a life of blissful ignorance, love, and acceptance. **Even the most unintelligent, uninteresting, unsuccessful, unlucky, physically disabled female lives with a level of privilege far beyond 80% of men.** 

#Part II: Sexual Anarcho Capitalism 

Of course there are the “Chads”, the upper echelon of men that are hoarding all the sex, leaving almost nothing for the rest of us. Gee, sound familiar? It’s almost as if free markets lead to wealth inequality, and **a free-anarchistic-overly-sexual dating marketplace leads to SEXUAL INEQUALITY.**

Like how bootlicking capitalists will convince themselves that every poor person in America “just isn’t working hard enough”, so too will blue-pulled normies convince themselves that incels just need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps! The world is completely fair bro, if you can’t find a date the only reason is because you need to take a shower and hold frame! Why do people think this? It’s because if you admit that the system is unfair, you must thereby admit that your success in the system is unjustified. Once you admit that the economic system is not a meritocracy, it is no longer possible to say “I earned it fair and square”. **And by acknowledging that the dating marketplace is unjust, you relinquish some of your sexual power.** Sure, you’ve fucked plenty of girls. But you didn’t earn it. You just got lucky. Your sexual conquests in life are not based on your own merit, but factors that were completely outside of your control. **Think about that before you go online and give “advice” to struggling men.** Remember that you have no fucking idea what you’re talking about when it comes to attracting women. 

I’m trying to open your eyes. You are deluded. You are wrong. Please, have the strength to just admit you are wrong. It’s better to look like a fool once and admit you’re wrong than to stay wrong and look like a fool for the rest of your life. Men are not the problem. You are not the problem, kings. It’s everybody else that is the problem. Just because someone is poor, this does not mean they are lacking in some moral capacity. Just because someone is sex-poor, does not mean that they are of lesser moral value. 

#Part III: Collective Responsibility vs Individual Responsibility

Also, I’m not absolving myself of personal responsibility. Nice try, though. Just because you admit that racism exists doesn’t mean you’re going to give up on life until the whole world is no longer racist. I’m just saying that your life can be shit and it’s not even your fault. **You wouldn’t tell someone living in North Korea “Hey man, quit complaining about the system you live in and only focus on yourself! Have you tried going to the gym?”** 

I know as a redditor this may seem SHOCKING to you, but we can work on self improvement AND point out problems in society, all at the same time! I know, crazy right? Isn’t that just the most insane thing you’ve ever heard? 

#Part IV: TL;DR

TL;DR Ideas from the sexual liberation movement have been taken to such an extreme that we are now living in a hyper-sexualized coomer wasteland. For women this has led them to having infinite access to sex and very little access to committed relationships. A incredibly small minority of men have access to more sex than any human needs in 1,000 lifetimes, while the vast majority of men are sex-poor and sex-starved. The data reflects this. 

There is only one whole in my argument: I’m an incel so therefore everything I say is automatically wrong.",1615930972

Recently I have come across two new ways of excusing female on male sexual violence. The first answer comes from a feminist in a talk about sexual objectification when she was confronted with the appealing behavior of women in front of stripper. The second is from a woman who seemed adamant about defending women's image as angel. Their answers was something like that :

1)  Women's sexuality was always oppressed for centuries, I can't blame these women when they finally get to express their sexuality freely without being judged. 

2)  When women does it (eg: touching, groping, scratching, slapping), they do it for fun. Women just go to male strip club to have fun between friends, they laugh and talk a lot between themselve and want their friends to see them interact with men . This is not sexual so it is not really sexual assault. 


For the first one, how does women's sexuality is oppressed today ? Do women remember the so called centuries of oppression ? I thought every women was sexually harassed/assaulted in their lives, how could they forget everything ? Would they be okay if men treated them like that ? 

For the second one, if it not sexual why the need to have naked, muscular and attractive men ? Why men going to sexual worker is sexual but women going is not ? Laughing and wanting to participate with friends don't make it less sexual. Btw, If it really was not sexual it would be worse. That would mean that women really not see men as human but as toys to have fun with.",1615911574

1897,MensRights,"Hello r/mensrights!

Tl;dr falsely accused, almost lost everything, if you are curious read the whole thing and if you’re really curious read my post history. A tl;dr cannot express this adequately. 

I’ve been a longtime lurker and occasional poster here. I am a guy in his 20’s who was falsely accused of domestic violence and I have been active on r/supportfortheaccused since just after my case started but I wanted to share here to bring visibility to this issue.

In May of 2019, an ex girlfriend that I refused to date again, decided that I said something just a little too mean to her and decided to go nuclear. I had been dating another girl for a couple months after our relationship ended about five months before. My ex was in a rough place. She was (probably still is) a dancer who had no real family to speak of and just could not find her way. Despite the crappy end to our short relationship, I still wanted to be in her life if only to show her that there were other ways to live and she didn’t have to do what she was doing to survive.

In April of 2019 I had decided that enough was enough. A mutual friend of ours killed himself because of her treatment of him and she had done, what she did to me, to the guy after me. Her kicking and screaming finally didn’t work and I let go. She did not take our friends suicide well and she started spiraling. She regularly tried to contact me and I ignored her. The day before this happened she showed up at my door and I saw the state she was in and felt horrible for her. She had some old bruises on her neck from, according to her, a guy she met at a BDSM club while she was out of state. They were yellow and fading so it had been some time. I knew she tended to be into that sort of thing and it is the #1 reason in a long list of why we broke up. She asked if we could go talk and I said yes, like a moron. We went out for drinks that night along with the girl I was dating at the time. My girlfriend had to work the next day and left about halfway through the night. I ubered with my ex back to her place and was worried about her suicidal ideation and wasn’t in a place to drive myself considering my car was still at home and the drinking, so I stayed on the couch.

The next morning, after I had made breakfast and was getting ready to leave, she started talking about rekindling our relationship which I refused. I told her I couldn’t carry her deteriorating mental health anymore and that this would be the last time. She seemed to have taken this unusually well and proceeded to hop on a video chat with that guy she met at this club and started telling him all the same things she would tell me. All the gushy nonsense. When she got off with him I explained that this was why I could never be with her. She had screwed me over and done this when I was with her, then she did it with the guy right after me, and she had done it so badly to our friend that he killed himself.

It was like a bomb went off. She jumped on top of me and started wailing on my face and torso and screaming incoherently. I didn’t want to hurt her so I just tried to block her arms and calm her down. I ended up with two black eyes, lacerations all over my face, bruises on the left zygomatic bone, and a fractured floating rib. I pushed her off of me and she ran and locked herself in a bathroom.

Some time goes by and the police show up and violently take me into custody. She proceeds to tel every officer wildly different stories and had had her guy in another state call for her who’s story was also wildly different from hers. He had never met me and identified me as the wrong race and in the wrong clothes as noted in the police reports. Every report is different actually and not on little details. They’re wildly different. The neighbors only heard the screams from when she was beating me and none of the supposed cries for help as I “strangled her” one handed. I won’t go into the ins and outs of everything since my post history is a pretty good play by play as this stuff was happening. The biggest kicker is that she continued to text me during the time I wasn’t talking to her and one of these texts is a selfie from the BDSM club out of state, where the bruises I mentioned earlier are clearly visible and it is from a good while beforehand. 

I think I’m set. I show the arresting officers and.....they don’t care. I am charged with a felony and class I misdemeanor. I spend 6 days in jail and denied PR bond. My family posts bail and I come out to my EMS licensure being “suspended while an investigation is underway,” facing expulsion from my college, seeing the applications I had put out for medical school since I was a junior being “no longer under consideration given the circumstances.”

She had called everyone important in my life. My mentors, my friends, my family, my college, everyone to tell them “what I did.” I faced losing everything. I fought for ~19 months. I fought the allegations in court but I fought myself most of all. I wanted to die every day and a few times I tried. I told the world what was going on, anyone who would listen, as I fell apart inside. I had my family and friends behind me as well as the girl I was with (she is now my fiancé lol) and they pinched every penny to pay the cost of defense, something I am blessed for. Then I noticed that nobody believed me guilty. I showed the reports anyone who would listen like a freak. 

The courts though, they didn’t care. The prosecutor on my case reviewed the data dump of my phone (all her messages, her threats of false accusation to me and others, her harassment after the fact apologizing for everything, etc) and the photographic evidence I put forward and added an additional felony. I was facing FIFTEEN YEARS in prison. My ex harassing me every day didn’t matter, my evidence didn’t matter, her blatantly inconsistent statements throughout didn’t matter. I was at a loss. 

One month before resolution, my family retained a new attorney who had been a DV prosecutor for the most liberal county in Colorado for more than half of her career. In this time, the original prosecutor on my case was fired for undisclosed reasons. Still, they would not dismiss it. I was offered a deferred deal of 6 months of probation and 60 hours of community service and I could plea Alford (maintain innocence and accept the sentence). The case would be dismissed at the end and the record sealed “for all time.” 

My family and my now fiancé wanted me to keep going but it was destroying me and destroying them. Not only had I lost almost everything, they had too. We sold everything and my grandfather no longer has a retirement. I could not live with what I had done to them anymore and my attorney said that trial was risky because even if they just convicted me of low class misdemeanor harassment, my future would be destroyed anyway. I took the “deal.” The statute for harassment in Colorado criminalizes everything and if you don’t believe me, look it up. 

The case is set to be dismissed and sealed in mid July but healthcare licensing departments are exempt from the sealing order (the list of exempt entities is longer than you would think) and I cannot find out if they will approve me for licensure unless I go through all the schooling and try. Myself, my fiancé, my parents, and my grandfather packed up and left Colorado. We are the first to do so in over a hundred years. The individuals involved in probation and the treatment they make you do believe I am innocent. They have been kinder than I expected and have done everything they can to help but their hands are tied in most ways. My ex continues to harass me monthly and has admitted, through traceable electronic means, that she lied about it all. I have posted an example here so you can see (it’s in my post history as well). I get death threats from her criminal friends weekly. The state of Colorado does not care. They will not file charges nor will they vacate them. I can attempt to file civilly to the tune of 10-30k that I nor, anyone in my family, has anymore. It has cost nearly $60,000 not including the costs post plea. We are financially destitute at this point and I have to live with destroying my family’s lives.

This is the face of false accusations. Lives are destroyed every day. Not just the men whom are accused but any who stand with them. I barely made it out alive and tens of thousands of others, at a minimum, live like this. This must end. We cannot as a society abide this anymore. I lived through regular sexual assault as a child at the hands of a woman. I was beaten daily the first ten years of my life by the same woman. She faced no repercussions. I was beaten again by a woman and faced the extinction of everything I had sought to achieve and she faced no repercussions despite admitting she lied and everything else I have said. I can tell you having lived through all that, that there is no more horrible thing to live through than a false accusation. I would live through my childhood a hundred times before going through this once. I am still broken and slowly picking up the pieces of my shattered life and I still do not know if it will ever be the same again.

I know that MRA’s stand with men like me. I know that we can do this. I am begging you and the world, do not leave the falsely accused behind. There are too many of us who’s voices are silenced forever. That is why I keep going.

1941,MensRights,I have more reasons to hate feminism then most as I got a serious criminal record for a domestic violence crime I didn't commit which fucked me up in many ways and has kind of ruined my life. It has been about 4 years since then and I have no motivation to hate on feminism at all. I expect a Maoist revolution is the only way true gender equality would be reached but I know most people here wouldn't want that as most people here live in the imperialist first world and benefit from the current system of extracting surplus labour value from exploiting workers in the third world. So why not just move on and live your life with the hand you have been dealt I know that's all I can do. There is no way we can change the current gender system the ruling class supports it. As I write this I realize I am still quite depressed and maybe would support MRA if it worked but I think men's rights is a dead end if feminism is being used by the ruling class.,1616925779

1946,MensRights,"I've been a part of this subreddit for many months. I've also seen A LOT of videos on YouTube about MRA and even feminism.

There are misconceptions from both sides about third world countries. A lot of people from first world countries say that they don't need feminism but third world countries do.

But based on my experience and what feminism spreads, it turns out women of my country don't want feminism too. The recent events on Women's Day confirm it. [I've made a post about it too](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/m5fnl1/do_feminists_even_do_a_research_on_a_country/).

*The summary of this post is that they don't research the culture of a certain country, they just want to promote their agenda no matter where in the world they are.*

I am speaking on behalf of my country. Yes, I am aware that some people (or women) of other third world countries may not have as many rights as my country but I can't speak on behalf of them. I can only tell you about my country.

Just in case you're wondering, I'm from Pakistan.",1616923378

1952,MensRights,"I am a single Dad. I have one son who's 14 with my ex wife and a daughter in my current (2nd) marriage. Tonight my son had a major emotional meltdown and lashed out at me. After hours of breaking down his wall we finally got to the core of his upset which is that he's afraid to trust me because since I divorced his mom (after she cheated on me, but be doesn't know that because he was less than a year old) she has had a revolving door of relationships and every time he gets close to the new guy she breaks it off. So he's angry at his mom because of her serial monogamy and he takes it out on me because of reasons I'm still trying to wrap my head around. He says he isn't angry at me for leaving and is very clear he's mad at her. I can understand it because she has literally been in 6-7 relationships in the last 13 years and every time ends up kicking the guys to the curb. I know this isn't really a men's rights issue, but truly, I don't have a strong community of buddies I can talk to. And I literally have no other Dad friends. So I'm hoping the mods will forgive me because I could use some support from men. But if this post needs deleted or refered somewhere else, I'll understand. Thanks in advance.",1616910711

I've been watching Sammy ""The Bull"" Gravano on YouTube recently. For those unfamiliar, he's a former underboss of the Gambino crime family turned government informant. He's pretty famous because he did a lot of John Gotti's dirty work.

Anyway I'm watching this guy, who is basically a total bastard, but an amazing story teller, saying things like ""That's just Cosa Nostra,"" and ""We were a secret society."" I'm listening to this guy talk about this evil fraternity of killers and I'm wondering why this is so interesting to me? All of a sudden I randomly understood it.

It's not about the danger or the crime. It's the fact that men's organizations don't exist anymore. I totally understand this sounds like a major stretch and there is a lot more involved; notoriety, Hollywood, etc.

But I honestly think that the public fascination with the Mafia has something to do with the lost privacy of men's only organizations. Why did the Elks Club need to admit women? What do women add to the organization? Why can't men have their own space? A hundred years ago it was normal for every man to have a career, a family, and a brotherhood. Now, anyone who talks about men's only organizations are treated like bigots. The only ones who can talk about it are former mafiosos who got out of prison and nobody can shame them any further. Back then, a brotherhood was an important part of a man's social life. The old divorced mafiosos with criminal immunity are the only ones left who don't care what society thinks about them and can talk about it.

I just think there should be clubs for men where women aren't allowed. Just a place to see friends and establish traditions, do good work for the public, and throw some parties. If that makes me sound like a bigot, then fine.",1616886343

What I've noticed is the prob tho, is not just the biased liberal admins but the fact that wikipedia loves academic sources and since academia is predominantly feminists, wikipedia is too.

So not too sure how to proceed, i doubt wikipedia is as important as social media platforms since the avg person doesnt have the patience 4 wikipedia but i'm still trying to make edits here and there. I figure the best way is to make small changes over time that r less noticeable that they will allow, kinda like slowly boiling the frog alive.",1616882436

1978,MensRights,"Paternity leave is beneficial for men. Many women get paid maternity leave after having children, but many fathers are left out. Paternity leave allows men to also spend time with children, and this is beneficial for young boys because boys with a strong father figure are happier and more successful that boys without one.  It also allows a break for men. It is also good for women because women can focus more on their careers when they choose to go back to work, helping increase women's wages.

1986,MensRights," (I guess this is why people here hate me since I've been calling myself a feminist, but I have no idea how else to label myself. What's the term that shouldbe used? Gender Equalist? Idk.) I am part of our gender equality association at work because I've been a slightly active advocate for some years  now. Ideally, the core of what I believe to be feminism is both genders being afforded the same rights. Like if a man accuses a woman of rape and vice versa, they should be tried and protected under the same circumstances. If a woman and a man file for custody of their child, ability and not how the 'more nurturing' gender should be favored(I know this is BS because my father is not a good caregiver, but I know a lot of peolple whose fathers seem to be better at parenting than the moms). Or something as simple(not so simple) as the idea that a man should be allowed to express themselves freely without fear of others telling them it makes them less of a man. 

 So my question: WHAT DO YOUR FEMINISTS BELIEVE TO BE FEMINISM? AND ARE THERE ANY BOOKS OR MATERIALS YOU'VE ENCOUNTERED THAT POINT TO THIS, FRANKLY, ATROCIOUS and ARCHAIC FEMALE SUPREMACIST POV?",1616000495

What I found was particularly interesting, but before I get to that, some headline figures:

* There were 695 victims of homicide.
* For the purposes of the article, ""homicide"" is a collective term referring to the offences of murder, manslaughter and infanticide.
* This figure includes the Grays lorry incident with 39 homicide victims.
* The homicide rate was 11.7 per million population (Men: 17pm / Women: 6pm - 3x difference)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, when homicide rates along gender lines are discussed, be it everything from official political medium to mainstream media to pop culture - we all hear the usual ""basic"" things such as:

* Men commit homicide more often
* Men are the victim more often
* Men killing other men

&amp;#x200B;
