23,MensRights,"So the other night I hooked up with this girl for the second time and we did a sexual act that she apparently felt very uncomfortable with doing later that night. I won’t go into the details but basically I asked her if she would do so thing similar to what did the first time we hooked up, she said yes and she seemed to enjoy it at the time. Fast forward to a few hours later and she has a break down and says I crossed the line and made her feel very uncomfortable. She also was really drunk so I thought she was just over reacting. 

I am worried, however, she might yell sexual misconduct. I am not in a position of power or anything but I have a prestigious job in a very liberal city. If she were to say I conducted sexual misconduct I could very easily loose my job. 

In the future how can i protect myself? I asked her if she was ok with the act but I guess that wasn’t good enough. I am thinking of hiding a mic in my room to record the audio when I have sex with women just so I have something as proof.",1612746344

26,MensRights,"So, I took my newborn in for a nose-job…
and his pediatrician flipped out on me. Can you freaking believe it?!?!

I told her that his nose looked different than my husband’s, and I’d like them to look the same. This should avoid any awkward questions when he’s older. The doc looked at me like I was insane and told me that was no reason to perform elective surgery on a neonate.

I told her that the girls would probably like him better when he started dating if he had a nose-job. Again, baffled, the doctor told me that she could not, and would not, perform cosmetic surgery on a newborn for such a ridiculous reason.

I told the doc that I had heard a rumor that my son would be less likely to get rhinitis later in life if we removed a little of his schnozola. Starting to show a little concern for my parenting, she told me that there was no conclusive evidence to support elective surgery as a means of effectively preventing complications or infection in adulthood.

Starting to get impatient, I told her that I just wanted to get this over with. After all, my son would probably decide later in life that he’d like a designer nose, so it was better to just have it done now while he was too little to remember, and probably couldn't feel it anyway. Looking at me like I was bonkers, she asked me what made me think that this perfectly formed little person wasn’t capable of feeling pain. Hadn’t he shrieked when he had a tiny pin-prick to draw blood from his heel? Of course he could feel pain!

I told her that I thought it would be easier for him to keep his nose clean if we just took a tiny bit off. I could see the doc making a mental note to call child protective services on my crazy ass, but she humored me and explained that it’s very easy to teach a child how to properly clean his nose.

I told her that I was afraid that years later, all of his friends at school might have a certain kind of nose, and that he would be ridiculed. The doctor told me that everyone’s nose is different, and that she would not be performing elective surgery on a newborn for such an asinine reason.

I told her that I heard that lots of people were having their newborns’ noses done. She didn’t even have an answer for this one… she was just so shocked that her jaw hung open!

I told her that this was my baby, and I wanted this nose-job done today! After all, how risky could it be?!?! The doc told me that performing surgery on a newborn is always risky, and should only be done when absolutely necessary for the well-being of the baby.

END OF DISCUSSION.

No nose-job would be happening for my baby today.
Disappointed, I began to leave.

But then I remembered the other reason I had brought my baby in to the pediatrician’s office that day.

“When can we have him circumcised?” I asked.

“We can fit him in today if you’d like!” replied the doc. “Although your insurance doesn't cover it any longer, because it's considered cosmetic, so you’ll have to pay the full $500 up front. Is that okay?”

41,MensRights,"TL;DR: The president sent all identifying information he had of all NCFM-Chicago members to random people he met at one of our meetings.

Hello Everyone,
I was one of the founding members of the new incarnation of NCFM-Chicago.  I am no longer a member as of Monday. I am happy to give any sort of evidence that the mods require to back up my claim(5).  Also, before I start my explanation it is necessary to state that I believe that everyone mentioned here has their heart in the right place.  Everyone truly believes that what they are doing is for the greater good even if the effects are not always beneficial.  

The reason I left NCFM-Chicago is that the president of NCFM-Chicago gave all personally identifying information he had of all of our members to random people(1) who joined our public meeting this last Sunday.  This includes:

Full real name

Email address

Phone Number

Home Address 

He did this on purpose(2).  

When I asked via email for all of my contact information to be removed from his list except for my first name and email he delayed until I called him. This caused me to reevaluate and request that all of my information be removed during our phone call.  He then sent me an email telling me that all of my information was removed except my first name and email.
When I reiterated my request to him for all of my information to be removed this was his response:

“Maybe you're right and I'm a fool. And maybe you're right to stay hidden away in your cave where they who are out to get you can't find you.”

How's it working for you, never revealing yourself to anyone, never trusting?”

As of the time of writing, he still has not complied with my request to have my name and email removed from his list.

I feel that I have been forced me to leave. I feel I have no choice because it is not safe to be a member of this group anymore.  

But the problems in NCFM(the National organization) go deeper than this. Please allow me to explain why.  

The leadership is technologically illiterate and does not know how to lead.

Leadership

A. The National President refused to let us keep the president who we voted unanimously to select and handpicked his friend to lead us(3)

B. We have received no guidance from the national organization on anything. We have gotten essentially no support from national besides some money and some swag(4). We got no guidance on bylaws, we got no guidance on recruitment, we got no guidance on how to hold events or how we should evaluate members or how to conduct ourselves or anything of the sort. All we got was a list of things we couldn’t do told to us verbally in a Zoom meeting.  

C. The national president requested that all communication between national and our group go through our president.  This means that none of us have the capability to talk to national by ourselves.   And then the national president promptly violated his directive by privately emailing another one of our members to promote this person’s pet project.

D. The president has banned different chapters of NCFM from working together.  This makes it so that when we hold events we can invite anyone in the world except members of other NCFM chapters. Because this is so bizarre, eventually our president and the president of NCFM national compromised. Every so often our group can invite on person from one other NCFM chapter to one of our meetings. 

E. NCFM does not appear to do any outreach.  The National president told me personally that he would prefer membership doesn’t grow much larger.

F. NCFM does not appear to be democratic.  Please read the bylaws(6).  There does not appear to be elections or change of leadership unless someone is forcibly removed or steps down. 
 I(a dues paying NCFM member) was never informed of any vote nor even when the board was meeting.   Our chapter voted for our delegate but he was never informed of when the board meetings were and never went to a single one(the delegate was me).

Technologically illiterate:

a. The National President refused to allow anyone besides the president of our chapter to have any passwords for any of the chapter’s resources.  Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, email, access to the website etc.  This means that all social media posts most go directly through the chapter president which in our case was a massive bottleneck. The National President must also be given all passwords to all internet accounts that we create which then only he and our president have.

b. The national president sends important passwords in emails in plaintext.

c. NCFM’s twitter account has been banned and they are not especially active on any other popular social media platform.

d. There are numerous formatting issues and typos on ncfm.org.  These were pointed out several times to the leadership and nothing has been done for almost a year.  The wrong name is used for the corporation when trying to donate money and the donation page looks like it hasn’t been updated since 1995.

e. Leadership accidentally changed the mission statement on ncfm.org  and didn’t fix it for more than two weeks.  Two weeks after they were informed of the error.

f. The National President refuses to allow any chapter of NCFM to have any website not directly under NCFM’s control.  We eventually got a website from them but any change to the website, no matter how minor must go through the National President and then through his web guy and then to our president and then we have to have a meeting to try to help him implement the changes. That is why it looks like a blog from the mid 2000s, the formatting is bizarre and there are conflicting authors for the same article.

Everything above is only a small part of the poor management I witnessed while a part of this organization.  This is much more.

I feel I was forced to leave NCFM-Chicago for my own safety.  I truly believe in the cause and still believe that these were not malicious acts, just poorly thought out.  Hopefully some good will come of this post.

There are six notes.  The third note is an explanation of NCFM-Chicago’s situation which is probably worse than NCFM national.

Notes

1. They were people who one of our members had found on the internet with no affiliation to NCFM and a tenuous affiliation with the Men’s Rights Movement.  This was the first time for everyone else meeting or even hearing about them.  The president sent out the personally identifying information to everyone who was at the meeting, NCFM member or not, after it had ended.

2. After asking if there was any objection from anyone to having their email shared with everyone else at the meeting.  But he also sent out the personally identifying information of someone who was not at the meeting and could not give consent.
For the record, he disagrees and claims that he asked if anyone objected to sharing their “contact info”.  We usually record our meetings but he declined to do it last Sunday.  

3. Our group formed late 2019 and voted to assign positions soon after.  The vote for president was unanimous.  Full disclosure, the vote was for me as president.

We then voted to become part of NCFM. We were told by the current chapter president (who leaked the information) that the national office has a mostly hands off approach and wouldn't mess with what we did. 

It took several months to actually become part of NCFM national.  During that time we set up social media accounts, made plans and had a few events. 

When we finally became a part of NCFM, the first thing that the president of NCFM did was declare his friend(and the person who claimed that NCFM national does not interfere) to be both the president and the treasurer of NCFM-Chicago.  This directly contradicts NCFM bylaws which state that each chapter shall elect their own officers. This person is still president and treasurer as of the time of writing this.

Our president has many of the same issues that the national president does.  Both have their hearts in the right place but both are technologically illiterate and neither knows how to lead.

The fact that this person was the only one to have any password posed a larger problem than we thought.  The person who the National president had chosen is to be the president of our chapter is, to put it gently, not great with computers.  It took us over two months after we requested an official email address before we got one.  But it was another 3 months before our President figured out how to use it(with lots of coaching).  
This caused significant problems for our group because we needed a way to prove our identity with the mods here at Mensrights(and other places) for our IAMA and public meetings.    This was far from the only time technology proved troubling for our president but is a good representation of how most technological issues were handled.

Before we became part of NCFM and got a new president we had quite a bit of activity and activism.  Everything from a teachin, to a movie night and discussion to general hanging out were planned with much more for the future.  
Please look at our IAMA(reddit.com/u/ncfmoc) on this subreddit for some of our plans.  

After the new president took over, all of this activity pretty much ceased.  All projects were effectively canceled.  Some of this can be attributed to CoVid but a lot of our plans were not in person and those ceased as well.   Our Twitter account was banned(as was National’s) and no one knows why.  Our FaceBook group has become entirely inactive with the exception of the president promoting things from his personal FaceBook group.  Our our website has been pretty much inactive and broken.  Over the course of a year, we have had almost no events and with my departure this Monday, our membership has grown by 0%.  

The one semi successful event we did have was the ICMI watch party and that was the brainchild of the previous president who organized and executed it with help from the current president and vice president.

The bylaws that the group had before we became NCFM-Chicago were temporary and expired 1 month after we joined NCFM.  We still don’t have bylaws almost a year later.  Not only is this a violation of the NCFM bylaws but I believe this is a violation of Illinois nonprofit law.  As of this writing, there are no governing documents for NCFM-Chicago.  This has been brought up numerous times in meetings and the president has continued to refuse to take action.  This also means that there can be no elections.


(4). The President of NCFM-Chicago got everyone’s home address by asking for it to mail the swag.  I had no idea he would store it and give it to other people.

(5). Please see the comment below from the official ncfmoc reddit account. After the previous president was forcibly replaced with the national president’s friend, no passwords were changed. I still have access to all passwords for social media accounts I set up as is evidenced by the fact that I am typing this comment with the official NCFM-Chicago reddit account.  This is after I repeatedly told them to change the passwords.

Truthfully it really hurts both inside my soul and all over my face and leg(I had to have nerve replacement from my leg to my face). I don't think I can handle another fight and me leaving.

Are thoes brief moments of her rage and violent aggression worth throwing away or history and future. I can't sleep anymore. I have noone to talk to besides the therapist. I think I'm just looking for the most convenient answers and looking for the easiest way back, out, or idk.

49,MensRights,"For some background , during the years 1987 - 1988 , a 16-year old babysitter ( Colleen Hermesmann )  had began raping a boy called Shane Seyer ( which was 12 in 1987 ) , she was eventually impreganated by 1988 and gave birth in 1989 , keep in mind Seyer was just 13 when this occurred (he was born in late '75).

So fast-foward to 1991 , Shane is 15 and Hermesmann is 20 .  the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services gets the bright idea to make 15 year old Seyer pay $13,000 (2019 money) in child support , you would think that Hermesmann would have been arrested , however she never recieved jail time and was charged with , ""contributing to child misconduct""  sometime before 1991.

So in 1993 a case was opened to make Seyer pay this , his defence?

He got raped.

So what did the court do?

Did they justly arrest Hermesmann?

No , they set a precenent that made minors elgible to pay child support , so Seyer ( a **RAPE victim** ) had to pay , keep in mind he was around 17 at this time .

The court even went on record to say whether he had been raped or not is a matter of no importance as the court deems the child as being the priority , even though a **RAPIST** had been taking care of Seyer's child for around 4 years at this point....

Now this isn't a one-off case , as I said this set a precedent .

And only 3 years later in 1996 , the same thing happened , however it was much , much worse (somehow) as this time it was a 34 year old raping a 15 year old and of course , he had to pay up at 15 years old.([https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/50/842.html#:\~:text=The%20San%20Luis%20Obispo%20County%20District%20Attorney's%20office%20sought%20child,welfare%20reimbursement%20from%20Nathaniel%20J.&amp;text=Nathaniel%20J.%2C%20by%20a%20guardian,Code%2C%20%C2%A7%20261.5%2C%20subd](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/50/842.html#:~:text=The%20San%20Luis%20Obispo%20County%20District%20Attorney's%20office%20sought%20child,welfare%20reimbursement%20from%20Nathaniel%20J.&amp;text=Nathaniel%20J.%2C%20by%20a%20guardian,Code%2C%20%C2%A7%20261.5%2C%20subd).)

&amp;#x200B;

1999 , the same case happened , this time it was 14-year old Nick Olivas and a 20 year old woman , he was ordered to pay $15,000.

Yes, I am aware that there are advantages and disadvantages from either side but both have the freedom to do anything without restrictions. But that's my understanding, someone who's actually from a first world country can tell me better.

Unlike women in third world countries where some of them don't even have rights like women in first world countries do.

If it matters, I am from a third world country too. This question/poll is inspired by my mom and sister when I overheard their conversation on how they don't like feminism and don't want it.

80,MensRights,"So, over a year ago (both 17) we were at a party, and she got suuuuper drunk, and was puking all over the place. It was about a month after we started dating, and she got drunk at about 9pm- me and some people at the party (her friends) were helping her the whole time, making her feel more sober and taking care of her. She tried to touch my privates multiple times but i kept on telling her to stop, that she was drunk and so on. As the night progressed, i was with her and a friend of hers who ive known since im 4 years old, and my gf fell asleep at about 12:30 in the night and i went to sleep much later after cleaning the hosts house and stuff, at about 3am. We all fell asleep and she started acting a lot more sober, was starting to talk properly, and she was getting better, so we all went to sleep (about 5 of us in one room). At about 6 am, (me thinking she was sober), she woke me up, whispering normally, touching me and stuff, and she did sexual stuff to me. I didnt touch or do anything to her, as she said no. She, more than a year after, says she forgave me, and doesnt care about it anymore, but that i took advantage of her for letting her do stuff to me and that how she felt about it after is whats most important to her. It was about 8-9 hours after she first drank and she had sobered up and slept almost 5-6 hours, i full thought she was sober. Did i fuck up or is she accusing me of shit without reason?",1612397322

88,MensRights,"It seems like the same discussions come up around Reddit a lot, so I figured I'd gather up some common topics, and their rebuttals.

Many of these arguments can be expanded with more points and sources but I'm trying to keep this as compact and to the point as possible.

####Myth 1: ""Sexism against men is never institutional or systematic""

Many forms of sexism and discrimination against men are *explicitly* institutionalized or systemic in society.

Examples include police violence, court biases, incarceration, child custody discrimination, military service, educational biases, health research and spending, insurance, housing discrimination, reproductive rights, bodily autonomy rights, and many others.

The widespread ignorance and denialism around these issues can itself be interpreted as a form of systemic discrimination against men as well.

Note that some of these are institutional because they boil down to statutory legal rights which exist in the realm of government policy and administration.  And the government is obviously an institution.

#### Myth 2: ""Most politicians and CEOs are men, and this has led to a society that privileges men and disenfranchises women""

The fact that many positions of formal power are occupied by men does not translate into measurable privileges for the average man.

The assumption this is based on is the idea that men have an in-group bias and prefer other men over women.

Which is an idea that has been debunked over and over again in the academic literature.  The gender bias among men is almost zero, and sometimes manifests as an out-group bias sightly in favor of women, not other men.

In-group bisses do exist among women though.  In fact some research has found evidence for very strong gender biases among women.  Including when it comes to educators, bosses, and hiring managers.  Women in formal positions of power do actually seem to prefer other women over men, in much the same way that men are accused of behaving. So maybe this is just projection: people who themselves have gender biases assume that everyone else does as well.

####Myth 3: ""Women were uniquely oppressed in history compared to men""

Much like today, sexism in history was often two sides of the same coin.  If it was unfair that women had to stay home and take care of their children then it was also unfair that men had to work long hours outside the comfort of their homes.  Many people try to equate sexism to the history of racism, as if men were unilaterally oppressing women for their own benefit. And that's simply not an accurate view of history (nor is it a very healthy belief to have).  

Gender norms were often unfair to women. But for most of history, women could own property, get divorced (where they usually took most of their husband's money), run businesses, and even be heads of state.  Many large empires were ran by women, for example.

The reality of the situation though is that pregnancy (and breastfeeding) often dictated the need for women to have men supporting them. Birth control and baby formula didn't exist. So your options were basically abstinence, or marriage. Which was the same choice that men also had.

**""What about voting rights?""**

Voting rights were historically tied to military service and the draft. It was never something that men got ""for free"" just for being men.

In England, most men couldn't vote until 1918, and that was only because they instituted a draft for all men during WWI.

Women aged 30 and older were also given the right to vote in 1918, and this came without the same obligation to serve in the military that men had.  Women over 21 were given voting rights just 10 years later in 1928, which was the same age that men could vote.  And that temporary age difference had a practical purposes: so many men died in WW1 that there was a need to even out the gender ratio.

So men have been allowed to vote for a whopping 10 years longer than women, *at most*.  And that was only because of the mass, involuntary slaughter that they experienced around the world during WW1.

Other obligations that men had were paying taxes, attending caucuses, and signing up for bucket bridges to fight fires.

It took a few decades in some parts of the world for people to decide that it was fair for women to be able to vote without giving anything back to the state, but I think it's important to understand the context here. It wasn't misogyny or oppression but political theory.  Specifically the question of whether or not it was fair to give women voting rights without equivalent responsibilities that were required from men (something known as a [moral hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard), and that can be contextualized as *""female privilege also sometimes harming women""*).

####Myth 4: ""Domestic violence and sexual assault are primarily women's issues""

Domestic violence and sexual assault affects everyone, and at nearly identical rates between men and women.

In the US, roughly 37.3% of women have been victims of domestic violence, stalking, sexual harassment, and sexual abuse.  Including 1.4 million women who experience sexual assault annually.

For men that same figure is 30.9%. Including 1.7 million men who experience sexually assault annually (defined as ""made to penetrate"").  The vast majority of these men are also victimized by women, not by ""other men"" (which is another myth).

This pattern is similar across the world, including in poor and underdeveloped nations (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/) for a collection of studies), and is consistent with a wide range of research demonstrating ""gender parity"" between men and women for this topic.

http://webshare.law.ucla.edu/Faculty/bibs/stemple/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf

https://1in6.org

It's also not true that there's a significant difference in severity between male and female victims.  Around 66% of intimate partner homicides do have women as victims (which is hardly a staggering majority), but when you include intimate partner related suicide deaths (including assisted suicides), a greater number of men are killed because of domestic violence than women.  These statistic also ignore the fact that lesbian relationships are more violent than heterosexual and gay male relationships.  Which inflates these numbers and doesn't necessarily back up the idea that women are being uniquely victimized by men.

We should obviously work to fight against abuse in any form, but our current, gendered approach to this doesn't seem to be helping very much.  It is also commonly used as an excuse for misandry.  Many people who discuss abuse against women do not actually care about female victims.  All they care about is advancing a culture of hatred and sexism against men.

**""But women are afraid to walk down dark alleyways at night!""**

As they should.  And as do men.  Most violent crime targets men. And fear is subjective. This is hardly evidence of some kind of unique oppression against women (at least one that doesn't also affect men), and it ignores the fact that men are usually afraid of finding themselves in those same situations as well.

Men are stronger and more capable of defending themselves so I wouldn't blame someone for having gendered views or assumptions here.  But let's try not to minimize male victimization or blame it on things like ""male oppression"".

####Myth 5: ""False allegations are extremely rare""

Multiple studies have found alarmingly high rates of false allegations in society.

As many as 1 in 7 men have been falsely accused at some point in their life, and they often have to live with those allegations even after proving their innocence.

In addition, around 1 in 20 women have also been falsely accused at some point during their life.

False allegations are particularly common when it comes to child custody and divorce, where well over half of all allegations have been estimated to be false.  There is also a common racial element that targets minority men.  Especially in history during the era of lynchings in the US.

####Myth 6: ""Men commit suicide more often than women, but women still *attempt* suicide more often than men""

This idea has its origins with faulty hospital reporting which lumps suicide attempts in with self-harm (which is something that's more common among women).  Women are also more likely to report their suicide attempts than men. And even if this statistic were accurate, it ignores the obvious fact that a suicide survivor can attempt again, thus artificially inflating this statistic.

The fact is, most suicid deaths are men, and most evidence points to there being more unique attempts by men. Any evidence that men are ""better"" at it than women has been interpreted as evidence for greater motivation of success, due to the very same factors that lead them to attempt suicide to begin with. Not as evidence that women are somehow attempting suicide at rates similar to men in the background.

####Myth 7: ""Men make more money because of their gender, and this is evidence of male privilege""

Existing gender norms encourage men to earn money in order to meet the financial demands that are placed on them by women.

This causes them to work harder and sacrifice more for their careers than women. Which they do in part because their income is tied to how successful they are with women, and whether or not they qualify as ""marriage material"".

The wage gap is therefore an example of a gender norm that harms men just as much as it does women.

92% of workplace deaths are men. Men work on average an extra 4 to 10 hours a week (depending on your source) than women. They start working at a younger age (often skirting child labor laws). They retire later (which is also during their peak earning years). And they die sooner than women. Men have worse health outcomes than women and that's largely because of the pressures that society puts on them to be successful and earn money to spend on women.

This is the other side of the wage gap that is equally as important, and that is equally as harmfully to men as it is to women. And it's really just the tip of the iceberg.

In many ways the wage gap is just a reflection of the financial exploitation of men in society.  Which is facilitated by things like hypergamy and unfair marriage and divorce practices.

####Myth 8: ""Men don't go to the doctor because of toxic masculinity""

The main reason that men sometimes don't seek help is a lack of time to see a doctor.

Men work longer hours than women at jobs that are less flexible, and more stressful, than jobs that women usually work at. [Men overall engage in an extra hour of paid and unpaid labor per day compared to women](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/), and an extra 45 minutes commuting to jobs that are further away. Meaning men on average have quite a bit less free time to go see a doctor than women do.

This is also something that changes during retirement: retired men are just as likely to go to the doctor as retired women.

https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e003320

A general lack of help and support, especially financial support, for men who need medical help also contributes to this.  There is a myth that men are better taken care of than women which has resulted in gendered policies that help women, but exclude men.  Even though it's men who often need that help more.

####Myth 9: ""Men don't speak up about sexism as much as women, so it's obviously not as big of an issue""

This is because people are less likely to care or listen to them. In part because many men who do speak up are silenced and accused of being misogynistic. A situation known as testimonial injustice or [epistemic oppression](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-epistemic-oppression/).

Men are told to keep quiet and many end up internalizing the idea that only women can be discriminated against, since this is what society tells us to believe.  Instead, men often adopt different terminology when they discuss gender issues.  Like referring to differences in treatment between men and women as ""double standards"" instead of sexism or discrimination.

####Myth 10: ""Most men's issues are caused by men themselves""

Most men's issues are caused by gender norms and those gender norms are enforced by women just as much as they are by men.

Men's issues are often just one side of the coin, and usually reflect disadvantages that women face as well.

One of the biggest gender norms in society is hypergamy, or the tendency for women to try to marry up, and for men to marry down.  And this gender norm is mostly enforced by women, not by men.

Two other gender norm that are enforced by women is the providership gender norm, and the childcare gender norm. Which also causes women to perform more unpaid work and earn less money than men in the labor market.

A fourth gender norm that is enforced by women more than men is the ""boys don't cry bias"". Which is mainly instilled in young boys by their mothers and by female school teachers.  In fact, fathers and male school teachers actually fight against this gender norm.

####Myth 11: ""Toxic masculinity is harming men and their mental health""

The concept of toxic masculinity has never been empirically tested, and some research questions the validity of it in the context of psychology and mental health.

Even if you do think it is valid though, it is still commonly used in a way that is sexist and hateful torwards men.

In recent years it has become associated with female supremacy, feminist hostility towards men, and misandry in general.  And as a result, the vast majority of men find the term to be sexist and offensive.

Men who identify with traditional masculine values have greater self-esteem, better mental health, better relationships with women, and are usually better educated than men who are opposed to masculinity or who accept feminist views about the patriarchy and toxic masculinity.

The key to better mental health for men might therefore be an embracement of masculinity, not a shunning of it.  Instead of trying to redefine masculinity, we should work to understand it better, and offer men better services based on an honest acknowledgement that men's and women's mental health might require different approaches.

Men are not ""defective women"", and treating men's mental health in that context does not seem to be working very well.

####Myth 12: ""Most men's activists just hate women or are opposed to feminism.  They don't really care about men.""

This rhetoric is normally used to silence the voices of men (and women) who support men's rights and prevent them from expressing themselves.  Which makes it another example of testimonial injustice or epistemic oppression.

The fact is that many people do care about men's issues, and that's why they become MRAs.  Feminism does get discussed in the men's movement, but there are a couple reasons for that:

1. Many feminists, ""radical"" or otherwise, have advocated against men and have even pushed for public policy in ways that are harmful to men or discriminates against men. Feminists themselves tend to not fight against this, meaning it's often up to MRAs to address it.

2. Many MRAs are themselves current or ex-feminists who were ostracized for daring to take the feminist rhetoric about *""also caring about men""* a little too seriously.

Warren Farrell is a great example of this. He used to be on the board of directors for NOW, the world's largest feminist organization.

And then he said that we need to work on child custody equality and reproductive rights for men. Topics that he assumed should fall under the umbrella of feminism since they are issues pertaining to gender equality.  Instead of agreeing with him though, he ended up being excommunicated from the feminist movement. And now he's often regarded as the ""father of the modern men's movement"" for carrying on his advocacy outside of feminism.

The problem that many MRAs have with feminism is that it usually stops half way when advocating for gender equality.

So sometimes what MRAs are doing is just taking it the rest of the way towards actual gender equality. Our frustration with feminists comes from the fact that they refuse to see this as valid (or do it themselves to begin with).

####Myth 13: ""Men don't receive custody of their children because they're bad fathers and don't bother requesting custody""

Academic research simply does not back this up.  [The only study that ever found something like this was discovered to be purposefully fraudulent](http://www.breakingthescience.org/SJC_GBC_analysis_intro.php), although that hasn't stopped people from trying to repeat this. The fact is that men are widely discriminated against on numerous different fronts when it comes to child custody and other areas involving family court law.  

Note also how hateful this rhetoric is.  This is the kind of stuff that you find repeated by feminists, and it simply doesn't treat this topic in a fair and honest manner.  Fathers love their children and many fight tooth and nail just to get a few hours a week to spend with them. The system is broken and it represents a grave social injustice that is deeply unfair to fathers and their children.

####Myth 14: ""Most child abusers are men""

A majority of child abuse is actually committed by women, and especially by mothers.  This is even more true when you include emotional abuse and neglect instead of just physical abuse.

By some metrics, the biological father is the safest person for a child to be with. This is because when men do abuse children, it often happens while under the custody of the mother.  Who is sometimes complicit in the abuse or even encourages it.

Close to half of child abductors and traffickers are also women, not men.  And many of their victims are boys.  Boys face sexual abuse and are also used for forced labor and organ harvesting. They are less likely to survive or escape, are less likely to be reported on or identified, and they suffer from higher rates of abuse than girls who are trafficked.

And yet very little attention is given to this.  Missing boys, and especially missing minority boys, are often ignored by society and the media. To the point that people often assume that most of the victims are girls.  Something which is known as the [missing white woman syndrome](https://archive.is/mRIJL) (although in Canada there is a lot of attention given to missing indigenous women, even though 71% of missing indigenous people are men and boys).

Note that I'm not saying these things to attack women, imply that they shouldn't receive custody, or to downplay the plight of girls.  Which is a lot more than you can say about people who try to paint men as the villains in this picture.  We should however be fair about what the facts are, and give male victimization, including victimization by women, the attention that it deserves.

Okay, I don't usually go in for this stuff but I came across a random comment somewhere that men today feel ""less masculine"" if they are circumcised and since it was the opposite when I was younger, I did a Google search and immediately found a ton of articles about the UN and WHO etc pushing hard for circumcision in undeveloped nations.  Knowing that Male Genital Mutilation (MGM) has highly debated, if any, health benefits and essentially proven serious problems, I decided to see if the same for women was once argued as a health benefits and so looked up ""female circumcision health benefits"" and immediately every article referred to Female Genital Mutilation (never EVER called circumcision) and associated with, of course, extreme barbarity.  But was shocked at all the articles taking about how mothers should circumcise their infant sons and how many wonderful benefits there are to women when men mutilate their most sensitive sexual tissue.  Too much to even get into - but this is absolutely disgusting - the idea that MGM (which I thought was rightly steadily falling out of favor with ... Everyone) now has new impetus from women who would probably riot in the streets if anyone, let alone a man, promoted it for women.  It's time men demand equal protection in law and culture - when is it right to mutilate a child - female OR male (and have it referred to as a women's health issue)?  I'm sure castrating men and removing their entire organ would decrease various things too - unwanted pregnancy, rape (at least using the genitalia for insertion) etc would decrease.  That's about how good the arguments for MGM are.",1612377737

104,MensRights,"So the other day i read how women use crying to get out of certain situations.  I commented how this girl i worked with grabbed my ass and smacked it as well like it was a normal thing to do. (Never knew her outside of work)   well she cried when i loudly told her to stop doing it and managment talked to me and tried to write me up.   I contacted a lawyer after i told my job i wanted to talk to our district manager.  (Corprate)   i filed a complaint against her with him and human resourses.   

Fast forward and my lawyer meets up with him and a couple of other big wigs.   (He had them pull the footage dating back 2 months prior to that meeting)   and as you guessed, it showed her doing it about 12 different times.   He laid it all out for them and how bad this could actually get and corprate met my demands and then some.   I got a nice raise, 3 weeks paid vacation, she got fired on the spot, and my general manager got 3 weeks suspension without pay for the way he handled the whole situation.   I also got a apology from said general manager and a promise to handle male sexual assult claims as serious as they handle womens. They also paid my lawyers fees.  It wasnt much since the lawsuit wasnt filed yet.   It was drawn up though ready to be filed.     (Justice!).  

I have worked with this company for 5 years and havent had any other issues other then this one and man was it a big issue.  Took only a couple of days to get it resovled once my lawyer took over.   So all in all im satisfied even though i just wanted her fired.   Literally all i asked since i knew there was cameras that caught it.

Edit to fix spelling and also to add: my lawyer is a pit bull.   He was outraged when he documented my statement with how they tried to write me up.  Its like it was personal to him.   Thats what made the difference.

Edit #2:    i shouldnt have to explain this but im going to anyways for more context.   When i was underage i was raped 2 times.  Once when i was 8 by my babysitter and moms best friend.  She was charged with sexual misconduct, and the 2nd time i just turned 17 and went to reno with a fake id and was drugged by a 45 yr old women.  I didnt press charges for that one.    This is just to explain how im not cool with people of any gender just putting there hands on me like that.   (I had to explain that to my feneral managee because he thinks it was her just being ""flirty"" and me making a mountian out of a ant hill)",1612971711

119,MensRights,"So my girlfriend and I have been chilling on discord talking about anything, and I wanted to share a song I recently discovered which I unironically like. It's [this one](https://youtu.be/l7ZlSHGFfdc) if you're wondering.

So she opens it, and among the first things she said was: ""... with this [ugly photo](https://imgur.com/a/SekFXFx)?""

I was shocked how she could say that at first. A fat kid, but then I thought of an idea. I would search for a fat lady photo, not necessarily ugly one, but fat nonetheless. And I sent her this photo, and asked ""Is [this photo](https://imgur.com/a/RuO5vmj) ugly too?"".

She went silent for a moment and then: ""No... it's not... in the first photo I found cigarette (we don't smoke) and colors ugly... yeah... cigarette""

Well ok, **the cigarette** is ugly, right.

I think that's the issue is that women never realized they had double standards against us guys, because they were always looking at themselves as beautiful and they were striving for beauty since forever. So when someone has a negative opinion of her looks, even tho it's primarily objective observation, they get offended, but not offended because we were jerks, but because **in their eyes** **we are jerks**. How could we say something like that to a lady? And now, she casually joked about this kids looks, and when caught, tried to dip out. She realized that later, which I'm glad she learned something about double standards. But that's the issue with women around the world **right now. And it's not ok.**

I think it would be more pertinent to ask: do individualist societies harm men psychologically more than they harm women? Considering how men are more affected by loneliness, have less solid social groups, commit suicide more, make the majority of the homeless, and are less and less educated, I think it would be fair to ask: is this caused by how we treat men?  


Honestly, that article strikes me as akin to those ""studies"" that ""proved"" how this or that race or ethnicity was inferior.

157,MensRights,"Ultimately I lost my soul mate and was sick of being hurt, which I made very clear in my video but not all women are bad just at the end of today women are encouraged to get careers.

Which is wonderful for the them, the problem I have isn't that the problem is women have always been the nurtures and and men have always been the provider. If you have no one at home to nurture the child/children then well sadly that child will not grow up right and more than likely will have many issues.

We used to think black crime was so high because of color this was always wrong, The truth is when those statistics were taken not many males had male role modals in their life but still had a very loving mother.

Now look at the spike in white male crime what's the common denominator split homes truth is most parents don't stay together, and it causes damage to the children who are innocent, I might add this isn't really something that can be argued since ever since white homes have been separated white crime has gone up.

Therefor it never was the fact the black homes didn't have a male role modal it was that people need BOTH and now a days women are looked down by other women if that's something they desire, not that I'm a traditionalist myself but data doesn't lie and since divorce is higher then ever children suffer the most.

Which is why I took the red pill and pain....lots of pain this video was more of me speaking on my own frustrations and what most men experience in the dating scene. Most women don't want to sit home and have babies which is their right, but if we aren't having kids and the kids we are having are seriously damaged is this really the right choice? [https://youtu.be/Vbb2jiobzKc](https://youtu.be/Vbb2jiobzKc)

I met my soul mate and if she didn't die we were going to have kids and I was going to be the one to stay home because she didn't want to have to and I think its important in the first 5-10 years of development , which we both agreed on it's important someone is always there to take care of them.

So, no I don't blame fucking women is it why I want to be single for sure cause if she wants both of us working the only one who suffers is the innocent child who didn't choose to be born so if someone isn't going to stay home and take care of them then stop having fucking kids, or cause divorce and broken homes fuck children up,

Why do you think so many women have daddy issues cause men aren't supposed to express emotion so most women don't have much a connection with their fathers if you need an article for that too find it yourself cause its out there. I've proved my point.",1612866991

175,MensRights,"A long time ago, people referred to ""circumcision"" for men and women. For men, this was virtually always removing the foreskin - for women, this varied, and could be less, similar or more.

When a single word is used for something, its hard to justify stopping it for women but not men.

The term ""Female Genital Mutilation"" was introduced as a method of ending female circumcision but not male. 

Once the term ""mutilation"" had been created, you could easily justify combating only ""mutilation"". What are you against? Mutilation, obviously? What about Circumcision? Well, that's different. 

By distinguishing between male and female circumcision, it very easily allowed and facilitated focus solely on female circumcision - despite the cases where female circumcision is *less* invasive.

**This wasn't a random development in language - it was a concerted effort to change the term for female circumcision into something more brutal-sounding, to facilitate gender-exclusive protection of women only.** 

**Hence why we should simply stop doing it. Refer to male and female circumcision. If you want to be more edgy, you could refer to female circumcision and Male Genital Mutilation.**",1612841314

From the article:

The male character they had pulled was Tarzan. He moved around the tree house dressed in just a butt flap. Disney had hired these good-looking, muscular guys—even airbrushing abs on—and apparently there was excessive pinching of Tarzan’s ass by the park’s female visitors. Knowing all this, and also knowing what women were like around Jack at the Renaissance Faire, I told the other guys, “Don’t complain if girls flirt with you too much. If you do, they’ll pull the character from the park.”

At least they pull out characters when they arouse women too much. But if a man was groping a female character, security will be there and he will be thrown out. Nothing probably happened to the woman. And witnesses probably laughed when they saw women groping Tarzan.


Ps: I often see that women were seen as sexual object in the past (say 50 years ago) but men didn't. Female sexual violence was always there. Always without any consequences. But now it is glorified, encouraged and is used as a good joke to show on TV, movies, etc.",1612814385

Hey everyone, my boyfriend of 2 years has been subject to some of the worst experiences men can be thrown in. His mother had him as an anchor baby trying to keep his (very accomplished) father in her life, even though he was married and cheating on his wife during basic. His mother has a slew of mental health issues that she has forced her sons to deal with. She is a classic narcissist with BPD. She dated around and had shitty bfs who would abuse her and her sons (she had another kid with another man). My boyfriend got involved with drugs because of her (she used meth heavily). He was involved in gangs (bc of her boyfriends). He ended up in prison at 18, losing out on his opportunity to join the army. On top of this, he has some repressed memories we just discovered of being sexually trafficked. His bio father wants nothing to do with him and denied his existence for most of his life. It took him taking a 23andme to connect with his half brother and sister.

He never was able to fully deal with these issues until we started dating. He got out of prison and dated women who cheated on him, used him for money, and worse. I'm very loyal to him but he still has intense trust issues. (from making money to dick size, you name the men's issues and they're on his shoulders)

When we first met he had no care for his life. He would ride super fast on his motorcycle, take painkillers, and more.

Fast-forward to now. I love this man. He is the most honest and hard-working person I've ever met. I've dated other men in the past and they seemed to always get worse in our relationship, like too comfortable to work on themselves. My boyfriend now is the only person I've seen work so hard to be in a better place, it's inspired me to be better in a lot of ways. He's been trying to get a solid job for a year now, but he keeps getting stuck with employers who use him for his hard labor and promise growth but don't actually follow through. In his current role, he's a glorified trash man and he's really messing with his self-value.

He feels a need to do something \*great\* with his life because he feels like he was born into being a nobody. His father and mother both expect him to just be a drug dealer in and out of prison. No one set him up for success. Every adult in his life used him for their own needs. He's putting a lot of pressure on himself. 

I know he needs to get some intensive therapy, but you can't force anyone to go to therapy. Therapy is also not useful if you don't want to go. I just need to help him build his confidence internally and to take the weight of the world off his shoulders. I'm not a therapist, I'm not well-versed in dealing with men's issues so deeply. We have free therapy through my work (he's on my insurance) and I'm working on getting him to go voluntarily go. 

Now, he's suddenly talking about want to break up because I deserve someone better. I don't want anyone else. I don't want him to talk himself out of our relationship because of money or finances. (I make significantly more than him and I support our household, including his lawyer fees. I don't mind doing this as long as he's also working full-time. I see no problem with sharing my unearned benefits in life bc I grew up with two-loving and hard-working parents who are able to financially assist me and not the other way around)

&gt;You have every right to live your best life.  Be yourself.  Express yourself.  Dress how you like and go where you please.    

&gt;Nothing that you do will make a man entitled to your body or your sexuality.

&gt;If a man looks at you in a way that makes you uncomfortable,  have him arrested or thrown out or have your brother kill him as is your right.     

&gt;Assuming you are of legal age you have the right to drink and your drinking does not give men the right to rape you.  If, under the effects of alcohol you beg a man to take you home and nail you to the wall,  of if you just find yourself dropping to your knees and pawing at his jeans - you have been raped.       

On the other side we have a person who says this is a bad policy,  who recommends women NOT place themselves in such situations.   He will be accused of 'victim blaming' but I often find his arguments compelling.  How was the 'rapist' to know that yes did not mean yes?  How could he have known that she was drunk,  what if he was drunk himself?  

Well,  it's 2021 and I begin to see a new species of this dilemma.  It has not fully gelled yet in the wider discourse so I have no handy name for it,  for lack of a better name I will call it the 'teach women not to use the tools we have given them and begged them to use' argument.  

One one side we have a person wearing a 'men are human beings' mask  who says things like  

&gt;You have sexuality and that is OK.  You can be attracted to women,  it does not make you a monster.  You can ask a woman out,  that does not make you a rapist.    

The conversation has not fully formed yet,  and because he has never been challenged he does not need to add

&gt;And if she takes this the wrong way and decides,  for her own safety and the safety of all women,  to have you expelled or fired or murdered or jailed,  as is her right - well that's on her.  It's not your fault.  You do you, take your chances,  maybe you will survive.  maybe.  

And because the conversation is only beginning there is no clear other side,  no one saying  

&gt;Men,  this is self destructive.  Do not place yourself in such danger.  Avoid women - they have the legal right to have you jailed on a whim.  You have no defense.  Many of them have been taught that they have a moral imperative to beg their friends and families to kill you,  and their friends and families will jump at the chance.

Basically France wants to set an age of consent to 15 and eliminate problems by not having an official one (15 is average in Europe), and although it seems good, a justice minister said that penetration is what makes it rape. Not the best wording and immediately raised a red flag in my mind.

Also when they write about what Olivier Duhamel did with his stepson, they call the accusations just abuse instead of rape. Looked it up, almost every source calls it abuse and only mentions rape when they write about the actual legal side of how difficult it is right now to prove that something was rape, they don't seem to be calling those incidents rape.

At least this is something: *""A notable change is the #MeTooGay movement gaining momentum, which details long-suppressed sexual abuse against gay boys and men.""* But not enough, also I don't think all children under 15 know their sexual orientation.

I'm not French but I hope they won't make the mistake of limiting what rape against children can be to men raping girls or men raping gay boys.",1613044770

If you're a person who can have sex almost at will, sure you might have a problem with that.

But if you're a person that receiveds so little interest from the opposite sex that you barely notice it when you get it, being fetishized seems like a boon.

I'm a black male. We don't even need to go into the stereotypes, we're all well versed. Matter of fact, we're probably the MOST fetishized men. Those stereotypes are probably a good chunk of the reason I've ever dated/hooked up with ANY non black women.

291,MensRights,"I made this post on another sub and someone told me it would be a good idea to post it here as well.

I always thought that sexism, be it misogyny or misandry, can be best understood through experience. I am transsexual, which means that I have experienced both being perceived as a woman and as a man by society. So here's my experience.

Background:

I'm ftm transsexual. I spent the first 18 years of my life as a girl/woman and these last 2 as a man.

My experiences as a woman:

The good:

Most people treated me very well and those who didn't mistreated me because I'm autistic, not because I was a girl. I was never made to feel bad whenever I asked for help and when I did people were happy to help me. Guys were happy to help with emotional issues particularly. They were always happy to be there for me if I needed to talk. Overall my mental health and well-being was taken more seriously. Additionally it was easier to make friends. It just seemed like others were more comfortable around me and felt safe to open up more around me.

The bad:

Nothing really. I never experienced misogyny ( and I grew up in yeehaw land). I wasn't exactly attractive so I never received sexual/romantic attention from guys be it positive or negative. When it came to other girls, there were a few that were shitty but I think this too would have been worse if I was attractive as they would see me as competition.

My experiences as a man:

The good:

Socially, nothing really improved. I hear some people say that men are taken more seriously, especially when it comes to the work place. But at my work men and women are treated the same. I am more confident now but that's because my gender dysphoria has lessoned considerably.

The bad:

I don't ask for help much anymore, especially when it comes to my mental health. Whenever I do ask for help, people are less enthusiastic about helping me. And I've also noticed that the quality of help I receive has decreased. I find that it's harder to talk to people. They just don't seem as comfortable around me anymore nor does it seem that they trust me nearly as much. it's hard to make friends compared to a couple of years ago. People just treat me neutrally and sometimes even negatively. I noticed strangers are more wary around me. Nothing like pulling their kids closer or clutching their purses tighter, but they stay farther away and don't make as much eye contact (not that I mind, but I'm sure many people would).

Final thoughts:

It was a very jarring experience. I went from being treated how a person should be treated (trusted, listened to, supported, etc.) To being treated like, well, a man. In my experience I've been treated far worse as a man. I by no means regret transitioning in any way, but I do wish that someone would have warned me about this.

Keep in mind, my experiences are my own. For some people it can be very different. Additionally, I've only been treated as a man for 2 years now. Maybe that ""male privilege"" I've been hearing about will kick in soon /s. Or maybe I'll just more and worse misandry, especially as I progress in my transition and become even more masculine.

My brother and his baby mama are currently separated and not getting along. Their baby is almost 4 months old, and the Mother is making it difficult for the Father to see her. 

It has been 3 weeks since he’s seen his daughter. She was out of town for 2 of those weeks. When he asked about seeing her upon the Mother’s return she asked what time he could come over. When my brother gave her a time frame, she got frustrated that the time was not exact.. so they ended up arguing. 

He asked if he could visit with his daughter at his house instead for a few hours, she flat out denied. 

She is breast feeding but in the past when they got along she was always happy to pump milk so his daughter could come over for a few hours. 

My question is: Is it legal for her to deny the Father access to see their baby at his own house?",1612979856

Been able to see some stuff on YouTube like raw interviews from The Red Pill and such. But when it comes to trying to find something that would be a deeper dive, it gets tough. 

Tried seeing if I could watch The Red Pill somewhere, but it's behind paywalls. 

Looked at my library to see what it's got. But my local library has zilch basically. The closest candidate I found for a ""men's rights"" book titled ""Why I'm not a feminist: A feminist manifesto"" but that's not really geared towards men's rights. But there were a nice number of options for feminist material. 

I might try looking at partner libraries more, but then there's also the question of how to actually access it. Like apparently one of the lending libraries does have web access for The Red Pill but the page I found it via doesn't actually give access. (Go figure.) 

And it's not like the library in my town is bad. It's actually very nice and well-funded. And there's been other times I get pleasantly surprised at what's available.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;From a purely objective point of view, MRAs are a lost cause. There's nothing in the MRM that is useful or needed for men's issues.\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Importantly, there's nothing inherently wrong with generalisations. The problem is when they are inaccurate and not at all useful. Throwing away MRAs is useful. \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;You say this, but then you've just presented a very common example of bullshit. Koss doesn't dismiss the experiences or say that women can't victimise men, she simply debates whether it should be called rape or a form of sexual assault (because that's how the law defines it).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;We can definitely debate whether she's right or wrong, but that's not a dismissal of the experiences.\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Except the fact is that it's impossible to help men and women whilst being an MRA. That's like saying the only way we can improve civil rights is if civil rights protestors and the KKK stop generalising each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Action needs to be taken against this mod because they are currently allowed to continue spreading their sexism against men. They belittle male suicide and use childish behavior to shove off the concerns of men about how they are treated in society as if it's a fucking joke. No, giving a fuck about men killing themselves doesn't make you a fucking incel.

&amp;#x200B;

feminists will tell us that it isn't the fault of the feminist movement that male rape victims are discredited and defined out of existence, yet these people still call themselves feminists, and yet we continue to have to see them act out their misandry unmitigated and supported by a network of people that absolutely despise men and deny them basic human dignity. This isn't complaining that feminists are mean, this is demanding that anyone who holds these opinions are stripped of their power anywhere they exist on reddit, on campuses and in our government. MRAs tend to laugh it off and make jokes that these are just crazy people with nothing better to do, but I really can't laugh at this, it's vile and it sickens me. I find rape vile and this is no different despite how many of these people try and tell you that you're not being a victim correctly. Gender parity in domestic violence and severity has been known for decades, and our society still refuses to aknowledge it while our taxpayer money does little for victims. I don't want to have to wait until I'm 60 for something this bad to be taken fucking seriously.

Okay, on topic. 

If a bunch of women got together, bought some land, and started building their own little town (without of the help of men of course) Would you support it? And what I mean by support is: 
1) Not try and actively sabotage it.
2) Not try and invade their space intentionally in order to mock/threaten/abuse/talk to them.
3) hold other men to account who try and do number 2.

If you would be against this let me know why.

Now I’m starting from 0 thankfully I have a good work ethic, credit score, savings and just bought a bigger, newer, and nicer house, it’s empty but happy, I’m working hard to have a safe place for my daughter...


This morning I wake up with a cash app request from the mom asking me for more money...

All this situation put my mental health in a bad place almost hang up my self in the basement feeling hopeless I don’t have anybody -family- in the USA and she wants from me


My question is any way I could protect my identity -Not scare of paying child support- I’ll support my daughter but at the moment even going $50 dólar out of my budget will put me in a difficult situation with my “new life”

A lot of men don't like therapy. There are several reason for that. One of them is it doesn't appeal to them. Men anf women are different and therapy is centered around female needs. An another reason is because they fear therapists. As APA Div 51 as shown us, psycology is heavily influence by feminists who will happily blame men, toxic masculinity, Patriarchy, etc. 

An option is male groups. Men are often more comfortable talking about things ""side by side"". [Andy's Man Club](https://andysmanclub.co.uk/) and Men's Shed (presend in UK, US, Canada and Australia) are such groups. 

You can also use helplines, forums and online chat services for male like these ones (for male survivors):

https://www.mankind.org.uk/ https://1in6.org/  https://forum.malesurvivor.org/ https://www.survivorsmanchester.org.uk/

But you have to be very careful. Some male groups are set up by misandrist to talk about how men are violent, ""toxic masculinity"", derail conversation toward women's issues or are not set up to help men but to ""make the world a better place for everyone"" (aka people believing that men need fixing because they f'*** up our world). Before using any services or male groups, check the website, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page to see if there is any misandrist or feminist things (Patriarchy, Male Privilege, toxic masculinity, redefining masculinity, ""making the world a better/safer place for everyone"", etc and anything blaming male issues on male or masculinity).  Try to find who are the ones who control or created it to look at their social media page too. 

For example, do not use Respect UK, No More, DV connect Refuge UK and Safeline. These are anti male. 

You must feel that they think that males have issues and not not that males are the issue. The latter will treat males as a cancer to society, something to fix and to convert to feminism. 

A last ressource that you can use is https://www.selfauthoring.com/ something that had promising results in men. It is promoted by Jordan B Peterson. You do it alone and can bring relief to a lot of issues bothering you.",1613095224

Some examples:

""I had checked with a hospital and been assured a male prep nurse would get me ready for a bladder neck transurethral operation. When the female arrived and I informed her of my accommodation she flipped me off and said SHE would be doing it.""

""I told my doctor that I was very modest and didn't want a female nurse taking care of me. Yet when I went to the Cath lab there were several women around and one male nurse who did the prep work. Then when I went back to the room the nurses were all female and when I objected I was told that there were no male nurses on the floor, I objected to them checking the site and so then they made it their objective to do everything that they could to ridicule me, embarrass me, leaving me exposed to the hall (uncovered on the bed so everyone walking down the hall) they laughed and giggled. I even heard one of them say that will teach him who is in charge [...] I even reported this to the Nursing board of Texas the didnt even do anything.""

""exposed my penis to the room and I remember two of the female assistants checking me out at the end of the surgery while my knee was getting wrapped, and I could only lay there and let it all happen. ""

""I entered the room where they prep you with 4 women. I was told to get undressed &amp; put a robe on. They were waiting &amp; looking at me to do it. I ask them to wait outside the door &amp; they laughed then went out. I was told to remove my underwear. I did. When they come in I was told to lay back on the bed. One of the female nurses approached me with an electric razor and started to lift up my robe. 2 other women were still in the room watching. I ask for a male nurse and received no response. She leaned on me and tried to force the robe off my groin. I held the robe over my private parts &amp; let her shave. She was very upset. She wanted me exposed.

394,MensRights,"Men watch out for bad behaving men and will frequently call out a friend for cheating, sexism, etc.. We want men to deserve respect so we police our own and try to keep bad actors from taking hold. 

Women do no such policing. They actively support hedonistic behavior of other women that is detrimental to society as a whole. When was the last time you heard a woman call out another woman for hurting a man? And to that woman?

Feminists are the worst offenders. Most are misandrists but try getting them to admit it. None will ever call out bad behavior of their peers and instead equality feminists are drowned out by the misandrists. 

The fact that women are letting feminism get such a bad reputation is the tell. They are all fighting that “Not all women are like that!” Bullshit.

406,MensRights,"What is the best age to circumcise?

""Circumcision removes healthy genital tissue that is prima facie valuable, while imposing  the risk of a number of surgical complications, ranging from mild to severe, the full extent of which is understudied and unknown. The favorable attitude of non-voluntary neonatal male circumcision  proponents toward the procedure appears to be at odds with that taken towards medically unnecessary surgeries more generally, especially when the affected person cannot consent. [...] Accordingly, from a moral point of view—which includes a medical cost-benefit analysis as only one part of the overall ethical analysis—we find that medically unnecessary circumcision should not be performed on minors who cannot provide ethically valid consent to the procedure.""

""Neonatally circumcised homosexual males—or heterosexual males who practice safesex—will receive virtually no HIV-related benefit whilst bearing the burden of unsafe choicesmade by others. It is also worth remembering that circumcision is not a failsafe intervention: itdoes not prevent HIV (or any other sexually transmitted infection). Rather, it may merely reduceone’s risk of contracting the virus by around half per coital act, assuming (for the sake ofargument) that the African findings are both accurate and generalizable.""

""The point is that no one other than the owner of the penis is better positioned todetermine whether they wish to assume the risk that circumcision might permanently compromisetheir sexual enjoyment. A person who seeks circumcision in adulthood also has the advantage of
being able to explain to the surgeon exactly how they want the procedure performed.""

""In the case of an adult, any complications that do occur are the result of a procedure that was voluntarily undertaken, after the adult had been informed about the nature andlikelihood of these very risks. This is not possible in the case of the neonate or young child.
Generally speaking, risks imposed on a person who is aware of the risks and agrees to assumethem in light of their own considered preferences and values are much less morally objectionablethan risks imposed on a person who is not aware of the risks and/or does not agree to assumethem.""

-The legal system (Again, sources please, anecdotes are welcome too)

-Circumcision (sources, and SFW images would be appreciated)

The idea that a man would become a woman is the ultimate example of a man acting unmanly, and conservatives hate that.

Type 2: Terfism. It's defined by pseudofeminist man hatred. TERFs see all men as evil and all women as victims, so the idea of a biological man becoming a woman is naturally seen as a sinister plot in their mind, and the idea of biological woman becoming a man is a sign of self-hatred.

OG post:  

&gt;Recently  I read an article on Maariv (link at the bottom) talking about how the court system reacts to falsely accused men of sexual assault trying to get justice by suing or pressing counter charges.  
&gt;  
&gt;After reading it I realized that:  
&gt;  
&gt;15%-40%  of all sexual assault charges are false (there's a lot of controversy  on those statistics, but when you look at it, those are the assault  charges that are PROVEN to be false, what about the men who serve prison  sentences yet didn't commit their crime  
&gt;  
&gt;30%-70% of domestic violence cases against children are false (including male and female)  
&gt;  
&gt;only  13% of falsely accused men cases get indictment, reason is - judges  don't want to scare women away from pressing rape charges, while it is  good to encourage women to press charges against someone who violated  them, it does leave the men out on the curb and give them no  compensation what so ever.  
&gt;  
&gt;I  know so many men who've been falsely accused without charges being  pressed on them, some have pressed charges against them and even though it was proven to be fake their lives were still destroyed, their families  started questioning their innocence, friends have banished them, they  got fired from their jobs, it feels to me like our justice system does  nothing to protect those men, it's as if we must choose one side and  throw the other on the curb.  
&gt;  
&gt;this is not right and I'm questioning why no one shines a light on it?  
&gt;  
&gt;seeing  those people traumatized by the mental stress that has been put on them  and the legal fees makes me sad for them and I wish I could do something  to inspire a change in how we react to false accusing women/men because  it happens on both genders but I feel like one gender isn't being taken too seriously.

This is a study which analyses MRI data of 16,683 healthy individuals 1‐90 years old (7,966 males). This study first reproduced precedent results: in average there is significant difference between male and female brain. But the main purpose of this study is the difference in brain variability between the sexes. Which means it quantified how much more diverse male brains were in comparison to female ones.  Comparisons of sex difference in variability in different characteristics (subcortical volume, cortical surface area, cortical thickness,...) were made.  As expected, the study found that male brains were significantly more variable than female brains (controlled for age).  Depending of what characteristic was meseared, sex differences in varability can range from 12% to 43%. However, sex differences in variability were found to go down with age (the older the less difference in variability), but differences are mostly stable across age (the decrease in differences is significant but not big). No correlation between average sex difference and sex differences in variability were found: the fact that on average a certain characteristic of the brain is similar between male and female doesn’t mean that there is no significant difference in variability.  Greater male variance was most pronounced in brain regions involved in planning, regulation and inhibition of motor movements, episodic memory and multimodal sensory integration (processing sensory stimuli).",1613316309

And I was muted for one month. Amusing considering I may have posted a comment less than five times in several months. And also because I can't find this informativity rule in the sidebar. (I have set my suscribed reddit to private, I think that's the reason. but if the moderators had see me on this reddit, I think the result would have been the same)

I know I'm not the first one to fall under some blatant undeserved ban. I'm more amazed by how little it demand to get it. I'm not even a little surprised by this reaction but I can't help me think about how these people live their live. How have they come to the point they are so sensitive about this ? What are their reasons, their stories ? 

Do you have some thoughts on that ?",1613278986

Men are the ones who go to war, sacrificing their physical and mental well-being. 

Society expects men to go fight in a war. It is seen as normal. What would happen if armies were made by women? People would rise and tell “How dare we send women to die!?”  

If you notice it, this is never brought up as a gender issue. Men going to war is seen as normal, never questioned, an established expectation. And it’s been this way for all through history, even now.",1613276702

473,MensRights,"I'm a student of economics in one of the south Spain universities.

Gender ideology rules in university, is financed, is political supported and it has dark purposes, sadly most of the teachers believe in it with the heart.

I'm a man, before university I don't give a shit about studies, I prefer going out with buddies, smoke, going party, drink, nothing good. But then I discovered my passion on economics, they help my to understand how the world is ruled and the roots of the political issues, so I give her all my effort and I put in to study her lots of energy, sadly I prefer study by my own in the books I like not the books they said so sometimes it implies bad marks. 

Year to year I improved my skills in study and understanding and with them my exams marks, difficult at first because I come from nothing. I found good teachers, other not but finally I'm in my last year. 

They give us a list sorted by note to select the theme for the final classwork and I was there second, I'm very proud of it, it is hard work, but the point here is the first in the list is a girl because she is a girl. She is a good person and I'm not here to blame her but to blame the university staff, she works hard but she is not intelligent she learns everything by memory, but in some subject where teachers are feminists they give them more notes because she is a girl, for example in advanced macroeconomics I have a 9'5 in the final exam and she has an 8, but the teacher give she a with honors so her note became a 10, and lots of other examples, not only related to my case.

I really don't care about marks, I never have good marks before university so I'm used to it, I care about justice and I care about the scholarship/grant because probably I have to continue my studies on a expensive city like Madrid or Barcelona

Sorry about my English, not because of the grammar but because my vocabulary don't allow me to explain very well the story. What I want is to comment with you an other example of how modern feminism corrupts the institutions

Probably is not only because of feminism, also education system don't care about intelligence, talent, critical thought, values, etc. They care about how you obbey an schedule, a superior and how you repeat the ideas they meant you to learn, that probably are not the Truth, so because I learn economics by my own way I pay this price",1613256539

475,MensRights,"A study with 819 first-year undergraduate students attending an eastern Canadian post-secondary institution. 13.4% of women and 8.5% of men were sexually victimized by a drunk perpetrator. 10.4% of women and 6.8% of men were sexually victimized while drunk. While both men and women experienced increased anxiety after sexual victimization by a perpetrator who was drinking, this relationship was stronger in men than women. Men in the current study may have been victimized more severely than women given that women are more likely to report sexual victimization of all types. This may account for the more pronounced negative emotional responses found in men. Rape myths (e.g., responsibility of the victim) also contribute to negative consequences exeperienced post-assault. While much has been done to combat female rape myths, little attention has been paid to male rape myths. The internalization of male rape myths is associated with more self-blame and poorer outcomes after sexual victimization among men. Males may also fail to report incidents of sexual victimization on surveys, even when their responses are anonymous.

499,MensRights,"It's no secret, the US Family Court system is discriminatory against fathers gaining and retaining custody of their children. Some states are really good about considering both sides, but some, like mine, just believe the mother because shes the mother! They CRY ""shes the mother, she has rights!"" but what about the father? What about his rights? What about the kids' rights? What about the child's right to not be abused? In too many cases that I've seen the father is the obvious choice yet custody is still granted to the mother, who just abuses the kids. 

Let me tell you a little bit of my and my fathers story. I was born in the US to my amazing father and my thundercunt mother. I'm not exactly clear on the time line, but I know meth was involved before my birth. I know my mother was using it when I was in utero. But it wasnt long after my birth that my father told thundercunt he had enough of the meth, and they needed to stop NOW. She didnt like that, and after a physical altercation there was a legal battle where she had falsely accused my dad of rape and assault. It was so obviously a lie my dad got off with only a minor assault charge that he got only because he took a plea to get me back. 

Meanwhile, me and my [half] sister are living with thundercunt, her boyfriend, and his kid. Let's just say it wasnt good for us. We had almost lethal amounts of meth in our system, we were starved, beaten, and our childhood ruined from the start. But! Sisters dad got her tested for drugs, and when that much meth was found in her system we were taken and she was given to her dad, I was given to my maternal grandparents for about 6 months. But I was taken after more neglect, specifically medical care. Then I went to my dad again.

I lived with my dad from 2 to 7. And there I had an actual childhood. So many good memories we share from that time. One of my favorites is that when my dad had a day off he would take me to this awesome amusement park. Hed tell me we were going there and I'd be so excited, I drop whatever I was doing (probably drawing on my big easel) and I'd be running out of the house half dressed! Hed have to chase after me like ""Babygirl! Come back! You need your pants on!"" Wed get there and my dad would be conservative with his money of course, but one day I reeeeeallllly wanted to go on the go cart track again after we had spend all the money loaded onto our pass. My dad just tried it even if nothing was on it... and it worked!! He asked the staff at the ride how many credits he had left and he had over the max credits. Whoever last loaded that card made it a master card, where you cant run out of credits. My dad says he thinks it was a mistake. But I think we ran into a certain staff member who saw this dad with his little, hyperactive shadow who was just so excited to be there with her dad. They probably noticed my dad didnt have terribly much to load onto the card, so they made it into a master card. Why the hell not? It's just a button on their computer away. And we certainly deserved it. It's amazing the little kindnesses you'll notice if you look around. 

But anyway, from day one my dad and I have been two peas in a pod. I am him, just little and female. One glance at us and its obvious. And we go perfectly together, even in conflict we still have that harmony. I was a really easy kid, I was fine doing my own thing most of the time, and even though I liked playing with other kids, I didnt need other kids to feel content. I'm a quick learner, I just need the how what and why answered and I understand. But I definitely struggled with some things really hard. Coordination to name one, I'd eat shit pretty much everyday. Once I hit school age my dad knew from my teachers and his observations that I obviously had a learning disability of some kind. 

Then re enter thundercunt. Thundercunt left us alone until I was 5 which was when she wanted visitation. My dad fought hard against it because I didn't want to see her AT ALL. But in the end he had HIS OWN LAWYER AGREE that she should be allowed visitation. So then I started having supervised visits with her. And those were fine, only a couple of hours. Then she got overnight, unsupervised visitation. And things got weird.

I'd come home and for a few days I'd be in this weird mood. I'd be shut off, shit down, nervous, anxious, unable to sit down, and not very responsive. I wouldnt look him in the eye. When my dad would press me a little for answers as to what happened during these visits I'd be very vague, never giving him a clear answer. Which that just isnt me, I was a joyous kid. Ask me a question and I'll answer 5 more you didnt know you had. And whenever my daddy said my name he immediately got my attention and my eyes. This just wasnt me at all. And what made my dad even more nervous is that when he asked who was there during the visit I said ""Mommy told me not tell you who was there.""

So then thundercunt starts to pick on my dad for every little mark on my body, accusing him of abusing me. She tries to make a CPS case against him over every little thing. But all the marks were from me eating shit all the goddamn time. So it wasn't working for her. Until one day I had a mark on my face from the dog, and thundercunt said I had a bite on my face. My dad checked again and again and there no such thing. But the next day when I had a visit with her I had a huge bite mark on my face. And it was ugly. I never got to talk to my dad after that to tell him what happened. Thundercunt took me into her work during our visit, and into the bathroom. She kissed my check, then bit me and HARD. She apologized and locked me in an office as I cried. She left me there who knows how long and then called the police at her work. 

And I was taken away. I was given to my maternal grandparents, then my thundercunt mother. And I hated it. I just shut down. I became chronically depressed at age 7. She tried at first, I could tell but it wasnt long before I was being locked in my bedroom for hours and hours. I had my first suicide attempt at age 7 because I felt so alone and sad. She hated me even mentioning my dad, I'd get hit if I dared refer to him anything other than a sperm donor. 

My dad fell into depression too, suicide attempts too... But child support took so much of his money. It got to a point he was only getting 600$ of his paycheck a month. And they took away his professional license so he couldn't work, then his driver's license so he couldnt even drive to work if he wanted to, and it just got him stuck in this hole. And of course he never got visitation with me. When he went to court for his visitation  thundercunt got a slap on the wrist and was told to attend visitation. But she never did. So my dad was stuck going into debt because of child support he was paying for the little girl he couldnt even see anymore. 

As the years go on, thundercunt gets a boyfriend who's a peice of shit. A MONSTER. I'll spare you the gorey details but from age 11-18 this dude physically, emotionally, mentally, sexually financially, ritualistically, and religiously abused me and other kids they took in. They drugged me to abuse me, make me forget, and manipulate me. It's a horror movie like situation. I tried many times to report them to CPS, but COS would come around, investigate, talk to thundercunt, tell her EVERYTHING I TOLD THEM then leave me at home with them again. They seemed to care about what I had to say until they talked to thundercunt who would tell them I am developmentally disabled and the case would be dismissed on that note. Or thundercunt threatened me into dismissing the case. 

After I hit 18 they kicked me out with nothing. No life skills, no money, no job, not even a high school diploma. So I was homeless most of 2020. But they were still claiming I was living with them for child support. 

Now me and my dad have been reunited and we're going to be seeking justice for the both of us. We couldn't be happier just being together again. Which just goes to show we shouldn't have ever been separated in the first place. 

The sad ing is that this isnt close to the only story like this I've heard. If I had a dollar for everytime I heard about a similar situation I'd have enough to pay for my college tuition.  

So yeah, the family court is against men and it shouldn't  be just because of a spike of father led abuse almost 100 years ago. This needs to stop, because I am a lucky one who made it out. I didnt make it out okay or even in one piece but I made it out. So many dont make it out. Either they're killed or they just shut themselves off to everyone.

I just started a podcast to work on trying to struggle my way through some harder conversations, talking to friends and professionals who have different viewpoints than me. I feel like the tribalism and group think dynamics that social media is teaching us is killing the art of the conversation, so I wanted to work on getting better and speaking and listening for long periods of time--long enough periods of time that I could begin to genuinely get to know people and perspectives that I don't understand. That's the project of ""This Could Be Interesting"".

In this first episode, I took some time to talk to my friend Ken Paradis who's a lit professor at Laurier University in Brantford Ontario. He has a bunch of interesting things to say about religion, especially evangelicalism, and cultural identity. We took some time to sit down and talk through some of his ideas and ended up spending a lot of time trying to sort out the role of masculinity in the modern/postmodern/postpostmodern world.

If you make it through our fumbling around, let me know if you agree with any of the points we made. What does masculinity even mean? Is it defined by society, evolution, both, or neither?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGcCuULuPGI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGcCuULuPGI)

A few years back (when I was 20) a girl from my class used the defenetition sexual harrassment to get me kicked out of a college (It was from a FB message I didn't write and that I apologised for). She not only said this message was harassment but also fabricated things I didn't even say - this was as a revenge for a series of unrelated events between me and her - the principle (woman) and deputy principle (man) took me in (while I was accompanied by my dad) not only did they not ask or listen to my side of the story in any way, but the principle started screaming and shouting at me (and my dad) calling me ""underdeveloped"" and essentially making me out to be a sexual abuser, while the deputy principle just powertripped and said things to me to get effect. Even when my dad argued with them they didn't budge.

&amp;#x200B;

After this experience I left my country (Ireland, honestly for the better because this college wasn't benefitting me) I found myself feeling dirty and ashamed over having any kind of sexual thought, I had trouble even looking at an attractive woman (It made me feel weird, which hard to explain on here) It also made masturbation very difficult and my libido was continually getting lower (I'm getting over the experience but my libido is still very low) I also felt very humiliated and was unable to talk to my dad for a long time, I only recently addressed this with him last month, actually.

My problems with this video:

\-It makes incredibly angry when the media or people act as If men don't understand boundaries or how not to abuse women, as if they're animals with no morals. 

\-sexual harassment by defenition, even though it was and is still sometimes a legitmate problem, is way too vague and which can cause alot of problems (this is just my personal opinion) and this isn't new, It's actually been like this since the 90's

\-Women abuse and sexually harass men too, and this is continually ignored

\-alot of young men have issues with sexual shame, guilt, psychological problems etc and I really feel all this just backs these anxieties and problems up

I've been trying to avoid this stuff as much as possible as of late, but I just really slipped up tonight. I really hope this idea of men needing to learn consent ends eventually, but It's hard to tell. If I said something that might be considered offensive I do apologise, this just really had an effect on me and I had to let it out somehow.",1613542897

"" Finally, feminism can’t be sexist towards men because of how oppression works. It has a unidirectional, systemic flow, from a group at the top that has social and cultural sanction to misuse power, toward the group at the bottom. Patriarchy hurts everyone — even men — but as long as men are in a greater position of social power that allows them to oppress women culturally, socially, legally and financially, they can’t be victims of sexism.""

528,MensRights,"So, it's just a little thing I'd like to share. 

I live in a post-soviet country, so it's already a bit depressing. But that's besides the point. What I want to talk about is the military. 

In my country if you're a man  from 16 to twenty something (don't remember it of the top my head) you get called for an examination (to determine if you're ""fit"" to serve) twice a year. And starting at 18 if you don't have a good reason not to join the army (I.e. chronic illnesses, broken bones, but that only helps for a time, being gay for just not straight also works here) you might just get enlisted against you will and send to peel potatoes god knows where. 

If you're not showing up, you can get fined and even jailed. 

Getting higher education helps, because if you prove that you're actually studying they'll stop bothering you for around 4 years. 

And it's not like the examination itself is any good. I can really find the words here, the best I can come up with is ""dehumanizing"". There isn't really a single part of the process that all that bad, it's just doctors who aren't interested in anything asking you things and checking if you really have these problems. But the part that just pisses me off is the last part, you just walk in a room alone with a doctor and he just goes over every health problem you claimed to have. And I get it, they're trying to figure out if you're just lying to get out of service. But the whole process is so god damn frustrating, because at every turn they just assume you're a piece of crap who never tells the truth and every proof you present is also crap. 

It's obvious that only men have to go through this. And, in my opinion, the whole process wouldn't be too bad if not for the societal pressure of it all. If you don't want to join the army most teachers (only in school) treat you like shit for not wanting to slave away a year of your life. I mean, my own dad didn't serve, he just worked in construction when he was in uni (in the USSR), yet he always says that I'm a wimp (or something like that. Language barrier and so on) for not wanting to work for free for a year. 

Quite a lot of people think that it's fine that a man has to either serve or he's not a man. 

There's always getting a contract, but it pays relatively little and lasts a minimum of 4 years. It is also almost impossible to get a contract, because the bar is set very high. But that's only for men.

Women have the bar set unbelievably low, plus they get a payed education guaranteed after service.

* Fathers are the butt of jokes more frequently in recent sitcoms than in the past.
* Fathers are shown in fewer parenting situations in more recent sitcoms.
* And when fathers were parenting, it was depicted as humorously foolish in just over 50% of the relevant scenes in the 2000s and 2010s, compared with 18% in the 1980s and 31% in the 1990s sitcoms.

539,MensRights,"I've been trawling through UN documents and in the lastest one, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women comes right out and states redistribution of power and resources to women is one of their goals.

The Committee makes recommendations to States. This one was about the application of 'temporary special measures' which are intended to make up for discrimination. 

Here are a couple of choice quotes which I found shocking.

**General recommendation No. 25: Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention (temporary special measures)**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;18. Measures taken under article 4, paragraph 1, by States parties should aim to accelerate the equal participation of women in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field. The Committee views the application of these measures not as an exception to the norm of nondiscrimination, but rather as an emphasis that temporary special measures are part of a necessary strategy by States parties directed towards the achievement of de facto or substantive equality of women with men in the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms. While the application of temporary special measures often remedies the effects of past discrimination against women, **the obligation of States parties under the Convention to improve the position of women to one of de facto or substantive equality with men exists irrespective of any proof of past discrimination.** The Committee considers that States parties that adopt and implement such measures under the Convention do not discriminate against men.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;39. Although the application of temporary special measures may not be possible under all the articles of the Convention, the Committee recommends that their adoption be considered whenever issues of accelerating access to equal participation, on the one hand, **and accelerating the redistribution of power and resources**, on the other hand, are involved as well as where it can be shown that these measures will be necessary and most appropriate under the circumstances.

The boys had to do 100push ups, a 3 minute plank and some other hard tasks (which we considered to be really hard, most of us are really sporty but we could barely make it and everyone who wasn't too sporty failed)

The girls had to do 10push ups, 15second plank and some other easy tasks (none of the girls in my class are really sporty, however every single one of them managed to get a 1 (=A))

So as a boy, doing 3minute planks, 100 push ups and some other stuff 

I GOT THE SAME GRADE

as a girl doing 15second planks and 10push ups.

And as a boy doing a 2min59seconds plank and 99push ups I would have gotten a worse grade than a girl doing a 15second plank and 10push ups.

572,MensRights,"I've been raising hell any time I encounter someone who uses the sexist and hateful slur ""mansplaining.""  I wrote a letter of complaint to the Mars Corporation over their use of the term in their Super Bowl ad.  There is no legitimate use of this word.  It's used to shut down discussion via shaming, and it implies that a man's explanation is automatically invalid based on gender alone.  Our society would never tolerate targeting other groups with this kind of word creation.  Imagine if a major company like Mars had used words like ""jewsplaining,"" ""blacksplaining,"" ""femsplaining,"" or even ""chinasplaining.""  There would be an uproar, and rightfully so.  So I wrote them back to let them know that's not acceptable.  

I've also complained on social media any time someone uses that bigoted word.  It's a word dreamed up by hateful feminists to denigrate men.  There is no legitimate use of it.  I've seen feminists claim it's needed to express the idea of a man explaining to a woman in a condescending way, but that's a cop out.  That's still stereotyping men as people who act that way.  Condescending speech has no gender.  We have non-gender-biased terms in English for expressing that idea.  

I've encountered people being very surprised that someone would object to this term.  They try to belittle me to shut me up by saying the same old cliches like ""fragile male ego,"" (which is another sexist and hateful term).  But I won't back down.  I've had it up to here with this bigoted term, and so I'm fighting back.  

I'm curious if any of my brothers out there have had similar experiences, and what you've done to fight back against this hate speech.  I won't stand for this hypocritical and sexist word being normalized.  There are other man-bashing / sexist terms, but this is the one that really disgusts me.  

If you've been fighting back as well, please let me hear from you.  But if you wish to write to try to justify this term of hate, please don't bother.  You should not try to justify misandry on a men's rights board.  You can go find some other forum where this type of hate speech is tolerated.

577,MensRights,"Yes, I generalized the question just so you can make a sense out of it for me.

I'm a big puzzle enthusiast and love everything about them (*important*). Someone was arguing with me about how it's unfair that men and women don't compete against each other. I gave her not one but three examples and she told me that they don't count.

These are the examples:

1. There are competitions for Rubik's cube type twisty puzzles known as speed cube competitions. In those competitions, both guys and girls compete against each other to get the fastest time. There are many types of events for multiple puzzles. But most of the time, both guys and girls are competing against each other.
2. The same is the case with chess. Both men and women compete against each other. Yes, there might be events for women only or men only but it doesn't mean men and women don't compete against each other even in a professional competition.
3. Similarly, in the competition of Sudoku, both men and women compete against each other.

I'm sure there are a lot but these were the ones that came on top of my head.

Generally speaking, I may not know any competitions related to strength, but I know at least 3 competitions related to wits where men and women compete with each other.

Why is it that these examples don't count if they are not that famous or not related to strength?

As a puzzle enthusiast, my opinion might be biased, in favour of puzzles, so I would like your opinion about it.",1613404606

No problem with the video, scrolled down to the comments. One guy said something along the lines of: ""You're good. They're ruining people's lives and you'll be helping people's lives"". One woman replied its the men who are ruining their lives. Ok. Another comment said women are profiting off of ""misogyny"".

First of all, women need to stop acting like these women doing OF are some morally upright women cause they're not. They're in love with money and see a chance to use their looks to profit off of LONELY, DESPERATE, DEPRESSED and traumatised addicted men. Cause that's most of the men buying OF, they wanna feel special, which is why they go with a single creator, but usually their lives are hell. Its the men's choice yeah, just as a drug addict goes to the dealer by their own choice, but these women are shallow.

They are essentially worsening their lives by providing for their addiction to sexual content. The horrible effects of p*rn and m*sturbation addiction, so no they're not completely out of blame or atleast they're not good people.

Its funny that women doing OF is ""empowering"" but the men paying are ""misogynistic"". Feminists love demonizing men for anything because they want to perceive men as evil. The men paying are lonely and need female attnetion, most likely depressed too. However, it's easier to disconnect from a person if you view them as subhuman so feminists will say that instead. Its funny cause they'll show so much sympathy to traumatised and mentally ill p*rn stars but no sympathy for p*rn addicts with the same conditions.

I'm starting to feel like women are aware of this too. That's why so many women advertise their new OF pages on dating apps. They target lonely men and get them to spend all their money. Its sick.",1613738591

625,MensRights,"I came across a interesting fact recently. In a survey done by the CDC in 2010 ( the most recent gender-comparison survey by the CDC) , called the [National Intimate Partner and Sexual Abuse Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf), more men reported intimate partner domestic abuse then women. (I will be rounding to the thousand in this post for simplicity), 5,365,000 men reported it compared to 4,741,000 women. Now we already know women will victim blame men, so let me drop that right here. The difference between these two numbers is around  900,000, which would be 18% of intimate partner domestic abuse reported in this survey. Domestic abuse in gay relationships is thought to be about 2%, so let’s do the math. That would be 113,000 of the total 5,365,000 . So now we still have a 770,000 difference between both numbers and 5,252,000 cases left. Since we accounted for homosexual relationships, all of those 5,252,000 cases are women abusing men. Now to be fair, we will take the 2% (lesibian and gay relationship abuse is about the same) and subtract that from the 4,741,000. Now since the same amount was removed from both sides, we have a difference of 900,000 again and the numbers for women are now 4,622,000, all come by men. Now that we’ve accounted for homesexual relationships and covered all the statistical mumbo-jumbo, we can get to the interesting part. If men are abused so much more in relationships, then why are abusive relationships stereotyped as men abusing women, and women get more support in this aspect?   They twisted the narrative and told half the truth. As an major example of them getting more support, let’s talk about the good ol’ VAWA (or was it VAVA?) Basically, they use government money to support intimate domestic abuse shelters and such. But they have a large bias against men (mEn CaNt bE AbUsed, ThEy ArE StRoNgEr) and won’t fund men’s domestic abuse shelters, but will gladly give money to a women-only one. On top of that, this bias actually harms men in abusive relationships a lot. Not only are they usually turned down from most domestic abuse shelters, they are even arrested after they call the police for help because they assume “man stronger = man instigator”. Now why are people ignoring this? It’s because feminism told white lies and made /reinforced stereotypes of men being abusive. There’s basically this same attitude towards men being raped, but that’s a different story. And the worst thing about it is feminists always victim blame and say “well men are the ones doing it” (I already disproved that) and “it’s the patriarchy’s fault” (feminism slang for “some men were in power 50 years ago, so it’s mens fault for all this“) It may sound like I’m going a bit over the top here, but it’s just so hypocritical.

&amp;#x200B;

How handsome he was, that man who did not court

the girls fawning all over him as if he’s already saved them,

it’s my leg, one said, raising her hem as she’d raised it 

in dreams

he knew of, for everything reached him as prayer, my leg, Sir,

is not perfect although as he looked, it glistened and the blood

became more productive. He did not date, nor rendezvous 

in tunnels and tents,

did not kiss except to heal, did not harass, malign 

nor mutilate;

threw no stones

&amp;#x200B;

and he was a man; never forget that he was a man,

&amp;#x200B;

that being a man improved him. Before the mothering. He was 

a solo act

ramming omnipotence down the throats of Ramses, Job, all 

the sinning nobodies

of Sodom. He was feared before he was born a triplet 

of flesh completing

the one vaporous, the other heavy and strict; now he’s 

desirable, vulnerable;

in the mother he visited stages of: fig, fish, pig, chicken, 

chimp before settling irrevocably

on a form more able to strive. This was a more significant 

time in darkness,

gestation of forty weeks, than three days in a hillside morgue; 

he learned maternal heartbeat

and circulation of her blood so well they became dependency,

and so he learned that some radiance is not his, hers

&amp;#x200B;

came in large part just from being Mary—how content she was 

even before pregnancy,

betrothed, blushing to ripen the fields; content even before she 

knew of angels,

and now, with this mound of baby, she was parent of a world 

whose prospering

she encouraged, activity of fish, magma, sulfur, the earth 

striving 

just as she did.

&amp;#x200B;

He was a man

yet the usher of miracles, preaching 

on a mountain

where reverberation gave him the power of five thousand 

tongues, yet not

a big man, not athletic, ordinary looking except for that glow 

and doves circling

him in the desert, doves that had been vultures earning their

transfiguration

by consuming decaying meat just as he ate all the sin; for that 

flattery, he bid them dip their

feathers in his eye, drawing into them that sweet milk around 

the iris.

&amp;#x200B;

He was a man

when he began to understand love, 

erasing the lines between

Gentile, Jew, and invited any who wanted to come to his father’s 

house for bottomless milk,

honey, ripe fruit, baskets of warm bread and eggs, wine, 

live angels singing. Weary revelers

could lay their heads on his breast, he said, needing intimacy; he 

thinks

as a man, therefore

&amp;#x200B;

he is a man

and good times, memories can be

adequate heaven. He knows the distance a man

is from his father, how likely it increases till the deathbed; 

he knows

what a man knows

&amp;#x200B;

the now and here, and can be called by name,

and can be wounded, and must struggle, and must be proud

every now and then or could not continue, must be worth 

something,

must be precious to himself and preferably to at least one other, 

must be,

in these thousands of post-Neanderthal years, improving, 

must have

more potential, becoming not only more like God, but more like

what God needs to become, so moves also,

so God moves also

653,MensRights,"Background: im a alienated father of 14 years and counting.  

Tl/dr im tired of being angry

So i want to dicuss and get some other info from other alienated fathers.   We all deal with emotions differently but i feel it always comes back to the same thing.   I feel angry/sad most days but recently more and more anger.   I feel like a complete and utter clown for paying my child support when i havent seen my daughter since her 1st birthday.   

I was adopted 2 times and found my biological family when i was 28.   Im angry because she is being deprived of 3 huge supporting and loving familys.   

My first adoptive mom got married 7 different times and put me thru so much because she had a tbing for abusive alcoholics.   I never wanted that for my daughter but all to my suprise i recently found out she is on step dad #9.   (Not sure if her mom married them all but she is calling him dad)   

I recently found out from my daughters best friend that my daughter has cut herself and refuses going to theraphy.   Im angry because legally and financially (family court is expensive) tied.   Im even more angry that her mom hasnt done anything to help her.  

Im angry because the majority of people who just dont care because they are either women or men not going thru it and refuse to beleive that it could easily happen to them.   

Im angry that i cant get the proper theraphy to help keep my anger and suscidal thoughts in check.   1. Because i cant afford it and cant even afford insurance to help cover it 2. There are no programs in my area to help men pay for theraphy (even though mens suscide rate being so high). 

So with all that said.  Is there anyone else who relates? What do you do to help it?",1613664786

668,MensRights,"Just want to preface this by saying that I am a trans guy. A female to male trans person for those that don't know. I'm a masculine man in all aspects of my life. 

Growing up as a man with a female body I got to see the true side of womanhood. I can't say I stopped being a feminist after I begun to transition because I never was one. Even when the world viewed me as a woman I never agreed with modern day feminism and I never agreed in the saying that men were evil. 

Woman were always the ones who put me down. Tried to put me in these little boxes. Told me things like all men were rapists and that every time I leave the house I had a 25 percent chance to be kidnapped, raped, and murdered. And yet, all my best friends throughout my life have been males. They've never judged me, never put me down, nothing. Men have always been there for me when I needed it. Women? Not so much. 

As I've transitioned I realized that men actually had life hard. More expectations, harder work, shorter life span, having to hide emotions, always being shit on, etc. Yet I can honestly say that I enjoy being a man. I like myself, I have some dope ass dudes in my life and for the first time I have no female friends and my life is actually drama free. 

I think women need to take a step back and stop being assholes to men and fear mongering the Hell out of young girls into hating us. Most of us just want to live our lives. But it seems like being a man is the worst thing these days.",1613647099

681,MensRights,"The law ratio (laws lobbied for by feminists for women and for men) and growing bias towards men shows the original motives of the 1st wave. Since people didn’t have stats and surveys to see the downsides of being men, they meant by equality to move up and be equal that way because they saw the obvious fact they were put below men. therefore, they mean “get better laws to be on par with men” rather then “make men and women equal in all ways” which explains why the act the way they act and why it doesn’t seem to live up with the latter defention.

When homosexual teens were committing suicide disproportionately as recently as the early 2000’s, it wasn’t because society was discriminating against them or treating them as sub human. It was because they didn’t cry enough.

When Natives commit suicide, it isn’t because they’d been marginalized from greater society and face abuse, it’s because they need to cry more. 

Right. It has nothing to do with any of the societal injustices that create the depression in the first place. It has nothing to do with fathers losing their children and all their assets in a divorce. It has nothing to do with being displaced at work by an under qualified woman. It has nothing to do with blatant discrimination in schools. It has nothing to do with lack of social services which women have plenty of.

704,MensRights,"I just got out of this mess happening and thought I needed to vent a bit to get this thing out of my mind and move on with the movie I was watching beforehand\*... So I, a 5’5 (165cm) engineering student, live in a condo (many houses enclosed by a wall) with my family for the time being during the pandemic. My brother was playing football in the courtyard when out of nowhere a dog comes running in his direction and grabs the ball out of his feet and proceeds to destroy the ball. We my family is pretty close to our neighbors, and the dog was not familiar (which directly led him to think it might have rabies, which is why we didn’t fight back). He get’s home, is very sad and irritated because it was his only birthday present for last year (of course no party thanks to COVID) and says the dog is still in the courtyard and is worried he may go after the balls that were still there from the younger kids from the other side of the street. My father, who has a history of very complicating diseases and if catches the virus is sure to be dead within the week, goes out to help me pick up the other balls and we proceed to lock the dog in the court to keep it from running away before we find it’s owner.  
 

Right after we do that, we hear one of our “what pandemic?” female neighbors who parties every week coming out calling the dog’s name and, obviously, does not have a mask on. I repeat 5 five times calling her to “put your mask on” as she hurries down the hill. She stops, no more than 30cm (1 foot) from my face when I tell her “will I have to hold you back?” and she replies with “If you touch me, I’ll call the cops on you!”. Nervous but level-minded as I could be, I reply with “No problem, now put on your mask”. She goes right back to her house, picks a mask, goes down the hill no problem and I even make sure to get at least 12 feet away from her. She picks up her dog, says we can put the destroyed ball on her mom’s check, and we both head back to our respective houses.  
 

Now, it is important to point out that this was only the second time I really interacted with this woman, and the first one was when we she threw a party right when I had just come back from São Paulo doing some volunteering at a hospital there (I’ll just say I could not last long there). It’s also very critical to point out that nobody is vaccinated yet, and she know my fathers medical history pretty well.  
 

A few minutes after we get back, this girl’s mother calls saying that her daughter was threatened by my, that I grabbed her and basically assaulted her. I would not be too worried in many circumstances, but the damn girl in a freaking lawyer with 3 month old baby (who did not deter her from partying like crazy, of course) and threatened to sue me for assault!  
 

And the worst part is, my parents are now shouting at me saying that I’m on my own and that the whole judicial system is geared against me, and if there are expenses I’ll have to find a job to pay it. All because I DID NOT WANT MY FATHER DEAD!  
 

I’m gonna be honest that I really want to move out and get on with in-person school as soon as I possibly can. Those friends who really know me know I could not hurt a damn bee if I wanted to (generally I just spend way too much time trying to get them to fly back through the window to safety 🐝) and now I’m scared to death because I now that just an accusation like that, regardless of court decision, could haut me for the rest of my life. According to my parents, she won’t bring charges or anything, but I should not be so scared for my life just because of standing my ground and telling her to put on a mask during a fucking once-in-a-hundred-years pandemic that, may I just remind you guys, has killed more Americans than the entirety of WWII!  
 

I’m just angry, scared, tired and just want to get back to working on telescopes and spacecraft like I was a year ago...  
 

If you guys have any advice, I would greatly appreciate it. I’m just a young person and have never felt so scared of having been born with the wrong bits down there... If it helps, I’m based on the southernmost state of Brazil.

705,MensRights,"First of all, please don't ban me, I like reading and interacting with posts on this subreddit

Second of all, most of the posts on this subreddit make me more aware of problems, but  the comments blame women and generalize women as if all women do this

You complain about feminists doing this but do it yourselves?

People act like some men don't contribute to hurtful comments about men

 ""You can't be abused by a woman""

""You can't be raped by a woman""
""You're gay if you paint your nails""


A lot of people in this world have old views on how the sexes should act, women should clean or whatever, men should do physical work whatever

But both women and MEN can contribute to these, telling young boys they shouldn't cry or express their emotions isn't good, it was mostly the women in my life that told me I shouldn't play soccer because it isn't ""ladylike""

Literally anyone can make offensive comments

If I see a post that implicitly blames men for rape, which I have before on the ""Feminist"" account on Instagram, and I say that rape can happen to anyone including boys and men, 

^^ my comment gives off ""All lives matter"" energy, but to this sub, im a patriot who doesn't blame men for everything (rightly so), 

but if I mention that men can also contribute to hurtful comments about men and boys on this sub, I'm ""disregarding what happens to men just to mention that Women don't do everything

708,MensRights,"A comment that I made to another post about the MRM vs Men's Liberation:

The men's rights movement was an inevitable and required pushback against feminism. No ideology should be allowed to run unchecked.

 Think Nazi Germany and North Korea. 

A pushback is necessary to keep them from having absolute power or disaster ensues.

From a feminists perspective, feminism was the inevitable and required pushback to the ""patriarchy"" (I despise that term btw). 

Feminism wants to quash the patriarchy. 
I think that is pretty standard methodology for all feminism. Even though the patriarchy doesn't exist but that's besides the point.

Did they expect that society would just give into all their demands without question?

That's where the MRM comes into play.

Men's Liberation lol.
This is a feminist construct to make it look like feminism is good for men. It isn't.

Feminism isn't going to ""liberate"" men.

Look at what feminism has done to due process and innocent until proven guilty. Two of the pillars of modern democracy and the legal system.



No. There is a response to every ideology.  There has to be. And the MRM is the required response. Not Men's Liberation.

**And I'm going to listen to the one that the ideology in question doesn't want you to hear. Not the one that it does. Because I'm smarter than that.",1613863315

Girl has a dog that doesn’t listen to her, so she decided to download an app that talks to the dog for her. Her phone then got damaged in water and was luckily salvaged. Later on, the app doesn’t work but for some reason all the “disgusting” boys were all listening to her. She later finds out it is because of the app, and her reasoning behind this is that boys act relatively similar to dogs. Already EXTREMELY sexist. The app does not work on girls, but if you were born a male, it works on you. This bothered me SO much as this was what the entire movie was based off of. Not only that, but she yells at the boy she has a crush on to kiss her when he was being reluctant, and he did of course. This was... I just have no words.

So I had a friend who got falsely accused of rape. And I’ve been thinking of this, almost problem for a while but, can you ever, completely prove one received consent. 

It just seems like almost anything can be said to vitiate consent at any time. But to me more accurate this is my example in words.

Let’s say this guy does it all. He asks the girl for verbal consent before he starts, periodically he checks up on her to make sure the consent is still ongoing. The girl is completely sober. Etc etc. 

Then she goes and claims rape. And her argument is yes I consented, but I only did it out of fear as the man is a 6 ft 9, 250lb African-American varsity athlete. 

Can one even argue against that. The only argument I even see that could go against that would be arguing that one is not a physical threat. And that seems impossible given the stats",1613961784

878,MensRights,"Hi, so this is kinda a story/ analysis of the stuff that made me an MRA and my experiences with sexism.

Let’s start from the beginning. During my childhood my mother was emotionally manipulative and abusive towards me, my sister and her husband. As a kid, I always felt like home was a potential war zone, as we never knew when she was going to snap and start yelling and emotionally abusing us. I never really had any connections as a kid and felt all alone. 

During my early school years, I found it hard to make friends and was often sad. I tended to be reserved and ungodly quiet. It didn’t help that much of the trauma from at home stuck with me throughout most of the day. I would sometimes try to tell my teachers about how I didn’t like seeing my mother so upset at my father (she primarily yelled at him but would also yell at me an my sister from time to time), and they would just say that that’s what all parents do.

During my later years of school I did eventually make friends and opened up a bit more to others. My mother still berated me and my family during this time. During my middle school years and elementary school years I always felt inferior to the teachers (who were primarily female) as well as the girls in my grade. I think it was mostly due to my situation with my mother at home. It still didn’t help with my self esteem.

During high school, I transferred school systems and I was back at having zero friends. I was shy as usual and felt like an outsider. During this time, the modern wave of feminism was starting to creep in, as well as the 2016 election. During high school, many of the male degradation campaigns started to creep into the high school and lectures. Also I was online a bit more and more of the things about how men are unable to know what pain is or are inherently inferior.

This is where some of my MRA attitudes came into play. I knew that being treated as a lesser being was not right and I would not bow down to the women who were “constantly being oppressed and unable to be mean or abusive” because I knew dang well that was a lie. I had seen and felt firsthand how women could be abusive and that men had their own set of problems just like them.

During college is when it really took off. I started college in 2018, and this is when stuff was really getting out of hand for radical feminism and anti male propaganda. While I (thankfully) was never accused of assaulting or raping anyone, it still didn’t mean that my experience was positive. During freshman orientation, we were given a speech on sexual assault and rape. Not once did they mention men being victims. It also didn’t help that I was very sexually inexperienced at this time, unlike everyone else, I didn’t have a girlfriend or boyfriend since high school or right before college, so some of the stuff they were saying about sexual assault and rape was new to me. It was infuriating hearing a bunch of girls snarking on how anyone who hadn’t heard of the stuff they were talking about was an idiot.

There was another talk less than a month later and it was similar in the fact that there was zero sympathy for men and zero mention of male victims. As time wore on in college, things kept getting worse, with the university pushing for more female oriented talks about violence and sympathy. It worsened my already bad anxiety and depression. My two trips to the mental hospital didn’t help either and I received little sympathy.

Anyways, all this showed me that the modern  world did not care for the problems that men had. It made me (and many on this sub) feel like lesser people. I do not hate women in the slightest, and I don’t blame them for everything wrong in my life. In fact, I support women’s rights and wish them the best in life. However, I have no sympathy for misandrists and the ignorance of male suffering and demonizing of men as a whole.

TLDR: Grew up with an abusive mother and school system that downplayed my experiences at home lead to severe depression and a rejection of modern anti male propaganda and modern feminism.",1613931170

My argument centered around behavioral differences and I made the point that, on average, men are more aggressive and interested in things, and women are more agreeable and interested in people, but there is more behavioral variance within each group then between. This is why you see the most violent humans skew heavily male. 

She blamed all differences on externally driven forces like societal norms and felt male behavior is a result of how they are raised, and what they are told they should be like, rather than biologically driven forces. 

I’m looking for more examples to prove my point that the majority of male/female behavior is driven by biological forces. One thing I remembered was car insurance is more expensive for men than women. But that that could still be explained away by “external forces”",1613909846

966,MensRights,"I'm sick and tired of this attitude.  First, marriage puts massive demands on a man.  Feminism has demanded that women be released from their gender roles, but men are still expected to adhere to theirs, and more so than ever.  You're expected to be a great provider by making lots of money.  Then, if you do, and you get married, any quick no-fault divorce can swipe half of that wealth away from you, plus possibly alimony and child support.  For a man, marriage is a great way to become financially destitute.  So then if a man makes the rational decision to not participate in marriage, society looks at him as some kind of creep.  Who's life is it anyway?  You can either get married and have those huge demands put on you and likely be destroyed financially and emotionally or you can opt out and receive a heaping helping of social stigma, as unmarried men are constantly suspected of being up to no good.  If you even look at someone the wrong way, you're assumed to be some kind of child molester.  

I'm so tired of all this crap, I'd rather live alone in a cabin in the woods and spend my days reading or canoeing on the nearby lake.  Maybe I could write some stories on a manual typewriter.  But being stuck in corporate America and simply expected to earn a lot and support a woman -- that sucks.  I'm sick of it.  I don't understand why any man would take the massive risk that is marriage.",1614098969

I couldn’t resist the urge to do something about it. I couldn’t just let myself be packaged away to live underground, I couldn’t just let myself stay depressed and suicidal, and let the accusers win. 

I met some other people with similar experiences and just wanted to reach out. Anyone that wants to send me their story so it can be heard. Just let me know, obviously it’ll stay completely anonymous.

981,MensRights,"Currently, I'm a 17-year-old guy and am in a much better place than I used to be when I was falsely accused of rape and sexually assaulting this girl in school, and thankfully things didn't get out of hand for me during the whole situation, and I got away from it relatively quickly...

So this story occurred 2 and a half years ago when I was in school... I was always the quiet kid in school unless I was around people I was very comfortable with, I was an above-average but not a superb student, I was in the school band and in the school table tennis team (and most of the band members were a part of the table tennis team, we were almost always together) and represented my school till the state level once...

I was a pretty reputed student around the school and was considered as one of the nice kids who were kind, always submitted homework before time, worked hard in school projects and, most of the teachers (who didn't teach me as well) knew me pretty well... I wasn't socially great but still recognized well throughout the school...

So in 9th grade, a week after the midterm examination we were having a PE lecture after which we had our recess, I spent all of that time (one hour for PE and 30 minutes in recess) with my friends, all of us played table tennis together and then ate our lunch together (in the class, our class teacher was in the class as well), right after the recess during lectures I was called by one of the peons saying that I was called by the principal...

I've never been called by the principal outside of a couple of situations where they called me and my table tennis team just to talk and congratulate us for doing well, but I've never been called alone... so I was a bit confused... while going to the principal's office the peon gave me many weird/disgusted looks which I didn't know why he did so at the time...

I enter the principal's office to see a girl crying with her hands over her face (I don't recognize her) and the principal looking at me with a VERY angry look... I ask what's going on she tells me to shut up, and said ""what you did is completely disgusting, you don't deserve to be on this school premises and I am considering suspending you for this"" which really caught me off guard cuz she's never spoken to me like that before... I ask again what happened and she tells me in a very condescending manner ""oh so you don't know what you did just a few minutes ago?"" to which I replied that I was eating food with my friends in class...

and then she asks the girl to tell everyone her story again...

(Back story of the girl: she's a student from the other class and she's one of the entitled girls who wasn't that super popular but still had many friends, she apparently had a crush on me, and she asked me out a few weeks before the midterm exams to which I rejected her very respectfully telling her that I wasn't looking for any form of relationship, nor am I interested in dating anyone and it was nothing against her)

her story mentioned that during PE class I went to the 5th floor where she was, and while she was going to the washroom I followed her and went into the washroom right behind her, and also then manage to keep her quiet with my hands, pull down my pants and rape her for 10 minutes and then leave her in the washroom floor and back to where ever I was...

and I was devastated on listening to the story cuz I've never even thought of doing this to ANY woman I know (or even not know) and I would never wish it upon anyone ever... I immediately started stuttering and struggling to speak cuz I was still trying to interpret what she said, I kept trying to say that I was with my friends the whole time, struggling to say anything and mumbling most of the things, almost on the verge of tears, the principal then threatens to call my parents and I get very scared cuz they're very abusive to me, and I don't know what they would do to me even after I was proven innocent, I kept repeating that I was with my friends the whole time to which then the principal  said ""okay then, call your friends, I want to hear from them, and I'll be checking CCTV footage of where you were"", my friends were called and the principal had the footage of my class, the 5th-floor corridor and the table tennis room pulled out cuz those were the places I either was or claimed to have been there (I was in the table tennis room during PE and in my classroom during recess) I was playing table tennis with my friends during the time period the girl specified and my friends also testified for the fact that I was with them the whole time, and even my class teacher was called and she testified for me too...

it was clearly visible that I was innocent and that I didn't do anything remotely close to what she said, and then the girl says that all my friends were in on it, my teacher was in on it too, and started saying more and more lies and tries to maneuver her way out of the situation...

my friends and I were told to leave the room and we did so too... I couldn't sleep for a couple of days after that cuz I was so scared because of the whole situation and thought that I would be treated like a rapist, put in jail, thrown out from my school, my parents would disown me, and a lot of other thoughts... a couple of weeks later after the whole situation I'm told that I've been removed from the table tennis team and won't be allowed to represent my school in any form of competition ever again, I was also removed from the school band, the girl was told almost nothing other than the fact that she had to go through an hour or so long lecture from the principal, she still told her lies to all of her friends and many other teachers, even though I had proved my innocence within mere minutes of being accused I was treated like a criminal in school, my friends spoke to me less as well cuz they didn't want to be painted as a ""rapist's friend"" (and I don't blame em for that) I got bullied a whole lot more than I used to be, my teachers would be more sarcastic towards me, everyone gave me the looks and made the last year and a half of school a living hell for me... thankfully these topics were never brought up to my parents in any way, and my teachers didn't bring it up to my parents during the parent teacher meetings though they were passive aggressive during em overall...

it was a really rough time for me cuz I was treated like an outcast, it made me go into depression and get into self-harm telling myself that I was actually a rapist, beating myself up for rejecting the girl, even having suicidal thoughts, and considering that life just wasn't of any use anymore, everyone would treat me like this even after school was done... it made me miserable...

but I'm glad I hang on to dear life then... after school was over everything was a lot better for me... since the whole situation never got out of the school (cuz the school didn't share it, basically shut it down to keep their own reputation high as well) and since I've gotten into college I've gotten away from the whole story and it isn't a tag attached to me anymore... nowadays I always keep my distance from all the women I know, surrounding myself with people who could testify for me, staying around CCTV cameras at all times so that I can prove my location at any time... and I really suggest you all do so too... never having girls as friends ever again...

I was reminded of this story today cuz of a nightmare I had with a very similar story... and just wanted to vent about it and also spread awareness that just stay away from women and surround yourself with trustable people...

&gt;Note: I won't be sharing the names of the girl, principal, peon/teachers, myself, or my school in the comments or anywhere to maintain my own privacy, you all are completely in your right to doubt or question this story in any way because you should never trust a random story completely and always have an ideology of innocent till proven guilty... these concepts go both ways... I'm not in a court battle to give any revealing information about myself to anyone here...",1614083654

I have come to the conclusion that feminist talking points are specifically engineered to disguise toxic feminine narcisism as righteous indignation. 

As an example of what I am talking about I draw your attention to [Second to last paragraph of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/lpuqbg/aita_for_wearing_a_tank_top_and_shorts_around_my/). OP said Roommate was "" tearing down other women"" because she (at an appropriate time, place, and 1 on 1) asked OP to be a bit more modest when Roommate had company over. the whole rhetorical method of representing such a respectful request as an attack makes it so OP can ignore how she imposes on Roommate and focus ONLY on how Roommate's polite request was an imposition on her.

what do you think? Does feminism disguise and buttress narcissism? Is it a coincidental function of dogmas created with no regard to it? or am I seeing links that are not present?",1614066325

996,MensRights,"For some context. I am a 25 years old male french canadian in a social circle ranging from 16 to 30. The wide range is due to the hobby of competitive video game. Along with many other getting busier in their life I no longer participate but I still hang out with them and sometimes we discuss/watch professional players.

One day, there was an outrage about a player accused to have raped a underaged boy. I know this sub often discuss about woman falsely accusing men. But lets say underage boy get a similar privilege too. Many in my social circle were mad and started to insult the player.

I said, while the justice system isn't perfect (because they somehow believe the system favor raper and men), the community doesn't have the competence to judge the guiltness and do self-justice, especially with so many grey areas. The pressure will push Corporations in which the players is affiliate to punish him and ruin his career.

I got plenty of immature reactions, insult, projection and reinterpretation of my words to debunk what I never said. Some stayed silent and some tried their best to be civil holding themselves. I was alone and a little afraid to speak up but I had to it.

So the player got banned of pretty much everything and lost most of his followers and subscribers as expected.

Many months later, we learn after a lot of procedure, he proved himself to be innocent with the ""victim"" public apologize.

People were like ""oh, ok."" Back to their everyday life with no second thought. That made me mad they didn't learn anything so I called out their hypocrisy. Giving themselves the right to judge, contribute to the movement that ruined his life and do as if nothing happened because they have no consequences.

I was afraid, especially considering their reaction last time, but I had to do it. But surprisingly, all the people that were silent people took my side and all the non extremist admitted their mistake. And the one extremist was seen as a dick.

That relieved me. They're not all my friends, but friends of friends, we're a big group. It's hard to get along with everyone and if I were to kick of my life everyone with different opinions, I'd have barely any social life. So I'm glad that I at least changed the mind of my groups.",1614054307

Today, on my twitter, I was put into a Group Chat of teenagers and college students. We were cool for a while until there was a video put into the chat. The video was a video of the poem ""Rape Joke"" (Look on YouTube under that name for more info) and it was a part of it that said ""Real men don't rape? I guess that's a ghost..."". Implying that all men lack the ability not to rape women. At the end of the video the it was a guy that put up a picture of a ghost saying ""Boooooh, give me those titties!!"" him being silly and taking there words in a literal fashion to make dark/light humor of their sexism.

I put in the gc(group chat) that ""I shouldn't be laughing..."" assuming that everyone understood the joke and was laughing at the dumb kid in the video. I got pounced on and called monstrous and kicked from the gc and blasted on everyone's page. They used semantics to take my words and twist them to suit there fashion. They proceeded to call me a rapist and blast me on twitter claiming that I thought rape was funny. I tried to explain myself and threw a couple of jabs back and that was that. 

All of the girls in the group are feminists and so were the creators of the poem. The poem said that all men like to listen to rape stories for ""porn"" and they use the phrase ""men get raped too."" as a way to silence women. I found it funny because I have a weird sense of humor and saw it as mocking the sexism in the video.

Now technically the United Kingdom is led by a woman, but when I checked the guardian article ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/18/female-led-countries-handled-coronavirus-better-study-jacinda-ardern-angela-merkel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/18/female-led-countries-handled-coronavirus-better-study-jacinda-ardern-angela-merkel)) asking whether women led countries were better at responding to covid (one can argue that a vaccine is a response), they included the Britain and Ireland as a male led country.  Since you can't have it both ways and I know Scotland is female led, I'm leaving the UK out..  That leaves only Denmark as a female led country in the top 10 and just barely ahead of Switzerland and Turkey.

Now lets talk about the gender of the leaders who's countries actually created a vaccine.  Just off the top of my head, I think they're all male.  Yay for toxic masculinity.  If a virus is nature's way of population control, I can see no more ""toxically"" masculine thing to tell mother nature ""No, I refuse to die.""",1614215932

The title says it all really but what I will add is that the article, as usual, does a horrendous job of creating a balanced response and there is no detailing specifics. If there is more to the article that actually would give reasons why she deserves paying it is not mentioned. The fact that she has done housework seems to be the only case they bring up for her validity of payment. 

It also says that the case sparked heated debate online but then goes on to only list 3 examples of the same argument that she should have been paid:

""Some social media users pointed out that 50,000 yuan for five years' of work was too little. ""I'm a bit speechless, the work of a full-time housewife is being underestimated. In Beijing, hiring a nanny for a year costs more than 50,000 yuan,"" said one commenter.

Others pointed out that men should assume more household duties in the first place.

Some also called on women to continue pursuing their careers after marriage. ""Ladies, remember to always be independent. Don't give up work after marriage, give yourself your own way out,"" 

There is no mention from the other side of the coin that would suggest maybe 4 hours of cleaning and child care per day is not unreasonable in comparison to a full time job (again the article does a terrible job at pointing out specifics but if we are to assume it is a typical traditional household then let's assume, until told otherwise, he brought home the money from work and she was working as a house wife).

Is that not a classic template of what one form of a relationship is? Sure I'm very supportive of the idea that she could have gone to work for the equal amount of time that her husband works and they find an arrangement between them to evenly do the housework and childcare. But that doesn't seem to be the arrangement here. As far as I can tell, he worked in 'the office' she worked at home. Fair deal. 

But now women want paying for that job!? Are women now saying they want to be employees of their husbands? Doesn't seem very liberating to suddenly have your husband as your boss. And as for the husband's. Might as well ditch your wives and hire a cleaner!",1614215212

Also I've always found this argument to be incredibly hypocritical , since most villians and grunts in most movies are males , so are movies anti-male now?

No , its just a movie and even though most villians are men , why does that matter? Them being men isn't the reason they'rebad.

Also the basis of the argument is that women become anorexic or something?

Which is an incredible fat lie , as women now , are as fat as the average man in 1960 America ( 75 Kg! ) and are 18.5% heavier than their counterparts in 1960 ( 63 Kg was the average weight of a woman in 1960 America ) .

So this whole oversexualisation argument is just stupid , hypocritical and downright a lie , considering how action heroes looked like in the 80's.

My mom was watching a show this afternoon where guests talked about their history with domestic violence/abuse. I immediately noticed, there were only women as gusest aswell as one hetero couple, where the man started abusing the woman when she slipped into an addiction.

Whlie the storys of the women were haunting and truly horrific, I'm sad there were no male victims present. I qulickly looked up the statistics on domestic violense in Germany, and at least 20% of the victims are male. Though that does seem very low compared to other rich countries like the UK und USA.

&amp;#x200B;

This LinkedIn study from 2019 used their internal data to examine differences between men and women when job searching. Among the key findings are the fact that men and women view a similar number of jobs though women apply to 20% fewer. A recruiter is 13% more likely to view a man's profile which she described as result of a problematic bias that must be corrected (even though they also found that recruiters will still contact both genders at equal rates).

However, the author (Maria Ignatova) makes no effort to hide her own bias (and sexism) by writing:

&gt;The good news is that when women do apply to a job, they are 16% more likely than men to get hired. In fact, if the role is more senior than their current position, that number goes up to 18%.  
&gt;  
&gt;While this is an uplifting stat, it does show that women do a very thorough job at vetting roles — sometimes maybe too thorough. If women only apply when they feel extremely qualified, this could also indicate they are not pursuing stretch opportunities.

Linkedin is a mainstream website, not a fringe feminist blog. Yet blatant discrimination in hiring practices is celebrated as ""good news"" and as ""uplifting stat(s)"". This doesn't lead to equality, it's just another piece of evidence that equality isn't the actual goal.

Her analysis is also very weak and uses the usual strategy of reframing all issues so that women are the real victims. I think a more plausible hypothesis for why men apply to 20% more jobs is because if we are getting rejected more often then we need to submit more applications to increase our chances of finding work. Of course I would submit fewer if I was getting offers at 16-18% higher rate.

For most of us, this is just seeing statistics that support what we already knew is happening. The worst part is just being gaslit, and told this is ""equality"" and if we have a problem with it we are misogynist or examples of ""toxic masculinity"".

1132,MensRights,"After doing lots of research on the topic of circumcision and other forms of genital cutting, I have identified a clear double standard that I would like to talk about and address here.

There are forms of FGM today that are less invasive than male circumcision, such as the 'ritual nick' which are criminalized, illegal, and seen as a severe human rights violation, and yet the more severe male procedure is legal and not frowned upon as such.

[Davis 2001](https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.bing.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1562&amp;context=healthmatrix) writes:

* “...federal and state laws criminalizing genital alteration on female minors are so broad that they cover even procedures **significantly less substantial** than newborn male circumcision.”
* “...a complete laissez-faire attitude toward one practice coupled with total criminalization of the other, runs afoul of the **‘free exercise’** clause of the First Amendment. There are also troubling implications for the constitutional requirement of **equal protection** because the laws appear to protect little girls, but not little boys, from religious and culturally motivated surgery.""

[Arora et al. 2016](https://jme.bmj.com/content/42/3/148) wrote in a paper published in *The British Journal of Medical Ethics*:

* “Male circumcision is legal in USA and tolerated in most of the world, even when done by non-medical practitioners in the home. Yet comparable or less radical procedures in women are deemed misogynistic and human rights violations.”
* “..the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics as well as WHO have labelled all forms of FGA as a human rights violation as it violates ‘bodily integrity in the absence of any medical benefit’ and victimises vulnerable girls. However, male circumcision is also a procedure that violates bodily integrity and up to recently was thought not to have justifiable medical benefit—but was instead tolerated due to religious and cultural freedom and the lack of long-term harm.”

[Earp 2020](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341965054_Why_Was_the_US_Ban_on_Female_Genital_Mutilation_Ruled_Unconstitutional_and_What_Does_This_Have_to_Do_With_Male_Circumcision) also noted:

* “There are now legally prohibited forms of medically unnecessary female genital cutting—including the so-called ritual nick—that are **less severe** than permitted forms of medically unnecessary male and intersex genital cutting.""

He also writes about the differences in 'khatna,' which is the genital cutting procedures practiced for both sexes in Islam. The male procedure is more severe and yet completely legal, whereas the female procedure is criminal in all 50 states and treated as a 'mutilation.'

* “The Bohras practice what they call “khatna” – an Arabic word for circumcision – on both girls and boys within their community...In the female case, “a pinch of skin” is typically cut or removed from the clitoral hood, often leaving no visible sign of alteration. In the male case, the entire penile foreskin is removed, leaving an unmistakably altered sexual organ. According to the ruling by Friedman discussed in the previous section, the less severe female procedure is already illegal in all 50 states—as a criminal assault. It might seem, then, that the more severe male procedure must also be a criminal assault. In fact, that has been a dominant view among legal scholars who have addressed the issue since 1984. However, the male procedure continues to be treated as legal regardless of jurisdiction, including in its more dangerous forms.”

The double standards don't stop there. There is a procedure that ultra-Orthodox Jews perform called 'metzizah b'peh' which is an ancient, unhygienic form of male circumcision where the “mohel” (traditional circumciser) tears the immature foreskin from the penile glans, typically without pain control, and then takes the baby’s penis into his mouth to staunch the blood and supposedly “cleanse” the wound. This has been known to have caused many cases of herpes and led to two cases of serious brain damage and two deaths in one year alone. Not only is this practice not treated as illegal—it isn’t even regulated. City officials ultimately dropped even an informal plan to require that parents sign a consent [form](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/nyregion/new-york-city-health-board-repeals-rule-on-consent-forms-for-circumcision-ritual.html).

However, any forms of female genital cutting, including ones done in sterilized and anesthetized manners are seen as illegal and criminal, **full stop**.

Now, some might respond with something to the degree of: ""Circumcision has health benefits whereas FGM has none.""

Well, the question I would ask is: ""If it was demonstrated that FGM had health benefits, would you concede your position that it is a moral wrong?"" Presumably not, and this is merely a moral red herring. If so, then you might have to be prepared to give up your view, as some health benefits have also been noted for FGM in many scholarly sources.

For example, there has been found: ""a lower risk of vaginal cancer … fewer infections from microbes gathering under the hood of the clitoris, and protection against herpes and genital ulcers.” - [Source 1](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1525/maq.2007.21.3.301), [Source 2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276160197_Female_genital_mutilation_and_male_circumcision_toward_an_autonomy-based_ethical_framework)

Moreover, at least [two studies](http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=iph_theses) by Western scientists [have shown](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265824402_Female_Circumcision_and_HIV_Infection_in_Tanzania_for_Better_or_for_Worse) a negative correlation between female genital cutting and HIV. The authors of one of the studies, both seasoned statisticians who expected to find the opposite relationship, described their findings as a “significant and perplexing inverse association between reported female circumcision and HIV seropositivity.”

Again, no one would ever consider making FGM legal on the basis of these potential, prophylactic health benefits.

I would also like to bring to your attention something known as ‘cosmetic’ female genital cutting, which typically consists of medically unnecessary procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other alterations to the female genital organs for perceived cosmesis—widely practiced in Western countries and generally considered acceptable if performed with the informed consent of the individual. These consist of the **same** procedures that are typically classified as FGM.

Given that there is overlap (or a close anatomical parallel) between each form of WHO-deﬁned ‘mutilation’ and Western- style ‘cosmetic’ female genital cutting, neither of which is medically necessary, one must ask what the widely perceived categorical moral difference is between these two sets of procedures. Controlling for clinical context varies across the two sets and is often functionally similar—the most promising candidate for such a difference appears to be the **typical age**, and hence **presumed** **or likely consent-status**, of the subject. But if that is correct, it is not ultimately the degree of invasiveness (which ranges widely across both sets of practices), speciﬁc tissues affected, or the precise medical or non-medical beneﬁt- to-risk proﬁle of medically unnecessary (female) genital cutting that is most central to determining its perceived moral acceptability. Rather, it is the extent to which the affected individual desires the genital cutting and can consent to it. This suggests that the core of the putative rights violation is the **lack of consent** regarding a medically unnecessary intervention into one’s sexual anatomy. This consideration applies regardless of the sex or gender of the non-consenting person.

We were having trauma drama after our son was born, I have no history of physical violence, and thought we would get couples therapy and work it out... but looking back she was on a different policy. She said I was abusive and she feared for her life and that I would hurt our son. Looking back, through therapy with a licensed therapist, they were projections. I recall her even saying no one will believe me because you're a man in one of her slights. Something inside told me not to chase... she seemed to be building a trap or at least emphatic about painting me abusive. In the meanwhile, crushed because I lost my baby boy... but, I struggled and managed to barely maintain weekly video chats with my son through her. I also managed to find unsteady work in another State. It has been a struggle to make an income during the pandemic however I managed to save enough for an attorney by the end of the year and hire a inexpensive private investigator. Putting together that she is most likely living near her wealthy parents. Long story short, my attorney manged to send her papers through a postal box she provided. However the court in my State where my son was born will not accept jurisdiction because he has been out of State for longer than they require, so I have to re-file in the jurisdiction of my son. Which means I need a new attorney and possibly another private investigator. This was little over a month and half ago, I was referred an attorney in his area and she said I have a strong case, however I've been unemployed with no unemployment and almost out of savings unable to cover her retainer. At my current rate it seems it will take me almost a year to save.  


No longer connected to my immediate family for some many years, like most men I have a limited support network too.  


I came across Men's Rights and reading about it, so much of what I read is my whole life!... A mother who constantly controlled my emotions leaving me emotionally frustrated which often got painted as anger even tho I wasn't, feeling disposable as a man in society, being circumcised was a not my choice and feelings of violation, in relationships with projecting traumatized women, and the list goes on.   


My therapist was the first women who ever saw me, even calling me a gentle giant, who's just been mistreated and mishandled.  


Conclusion, I was supposed to be the stay at home parent and to this day I know I was/am the better ""mother"". I love my son dearly, he's my #1 and deserves his father too... but struggling to find my way... I'm so overwhelmed with struggle and pain feeling like I'm frozen, living in a constant nightmare.

Married couple uses artificial insemination to try to get pregnant, first attempt fails. Husband divorces wife, but there are still frozen embryos. The ex-wife sues for the right to use the frozen embryos even against the wishes of her ex-husband.

The court not only ruled that she can, as his consent to the fertilization was ""irrevocable"", but that he'll also be responsible for any resulting child.

There aren't any special ""ifs"" or ""buts"" in the case, it's as bad as it sounds. The husband will probably appeal but it might well be too late: if she goes ahead with implantatin and has a child, he'll be on the hook for it no matter what as Italian law is adamant that biological parents are always legally responsible for their children regardless of any other circumstance.",1614366838

I feel like I need to vent a bit. I'm a medical student and in my 3rd year. Needless to say, we're well into the realm of dealing with patients and helping out with their care and medical treatment etc...

The world of medicine, I've noticed, is *profoundly* gynocentric, to the extent I've actually started to second guess my career choices in becoming a Dr... CONSTANT messages about ""brave women in medicine"", and ""Encouraging and celebrating female doctors"", meanwhile males fall behind in education and women start to dominate medical school entry and graduates. The majority of new and young doctors are female, and with the education system essentially rigged to pull the best academic performance out of female students, celebrating females in a career path like medicine while males fall behind seems profoundly sexist to me... Our medical school even has a formal event called ""Women in Medicine"" dedicated to celebrating the female students in our course... It is truely pathetic....

On another point, EVERY gynaecology or breast lecture/tutorial we get, the teaching physician says something to the affect of ""now, MALE medical students REQUIRE a chaperone, because we don't want any of these female patients accusing you of something you haven't done""... It makes my blood boil that my female colleagues can examine a female patient without ANY restrictions or concerns about false accusations, and they can approach these patients the same way they approach a patient with any other medical concern. AS a male? I need there to be a nurse free to sit with me while I do the exam, I need written consent from the patient, and I need to tip-toe around out of fear the female patient will misinterpret or dislike something I say and falsely accuse me of something like sexual assault.There were something like 45 accusations of sexual misconduct made against Doctors in January of 2020 in Australia, and only 2 were investigated further. in other words, 43 were verified FALSE. Male Drs are having these accusations made about them in seriously high numbers.... And what's worse is many of the male doctors who were accused, investigated, and cleared of any wrongdoing STILL have gender-based practice restrictions. Imagine being a male endocrinologist and not being allowed to see female patients (the majority of your patient list) because of a verifiably false accusation... Imagine losing your income, and imagine losing your reputation, just like that....

Tl;dr it's seriously dangerous being a male doctor dealing with female patients... And you're seriously under-appreciated as a male doctor, mainly because you're a male...",1614310135

His brother was not circumcised, and the ""phimosis"" soon resolved naturally.

The way feminists look at men, is as if all men want only to rape and kill women, and feminists work day and night to install in as many women as possible this delusional paranoid mindset.

- additionally, she told me that she was infertile due to a reproductive condition unless she went on specialized medicine.

- she just told me today that she's miraculously pregnant from the one time we had sex, even given her dire reproductive issues.

- during our discussion about it, she seemed to focus on her desire to have a baby/family, while brushing aside the consequences of doing so.

However oddly enough if you search misandrist Clinton's quote , its actually supported , which is kind of yikes.

So lets evaluate this quote , ""Women are the primary victims of war"".

Now everyone is a victim in war however war affects men worse than women due to the draft , this is very evident in WW2 , as there were 35,000,000 soldiers who were killed  and most were  drafted.

Now even if we equate rape to murder ( which I think we should ) , its practically impossible for any faction to have raped 35,000,000 women , even if we looked at all the factions of World War II , its impossible , the Soviets had around 30,000,000 military personal , the Nazis had 13,000,000 and the other factions had a collective 15,000,000 or so.

So every Soviet soldier would have to rape , which is just impossible as the average Soviet Soldier had a lifespan of less than a day , even though the nazis raped alot and were by far the most brutal faction it would still be impossible as even if 1 in 10 Soviets raped , that means the Nazi's would have to rape around 32,000,000 , which is impossible.

So why this quote important? Well it shows the double standards that people have , keep in mind when Trump said ""grab them by the P "" people recoiled in disgust ( as they should ) however Clinton said somehting far worse yet gets no pushback at all?

Next time you get into one of these arguments hit them with this...

“Let’s say for a minute that this is indeed true, that radical feminism is just a minority that speaks over the whole movement and makes actual feminists look bad.

Why would you rather go through the vast lengths it would take to clear feminisms reputation when you can simply just call yourselves men and women’s rights activists?

You could spend the nanoseconds worth of time and energy to just stop associating yourself with an already widely unaccepted movement amongst men but you choose to waste months of time and energy on end trying to fix the rational repulsive attitude men have towards feminism, why is that?

Also

You know that men as a whole at this point are on edge, most of us have severe issues due to the inherently destructive behaviors that we were (and still are) slammed with via social conditioning from a very young age. 

You know that men’s issues are being either created or sent to the next extreme every day by feminists across the globe.

You know this point men as a whole are so unprotected and left so vulnerable in our society that a group of women with a decent level of social political standing could come up one day and say 90% of all men need to be castrated at birth for the safety of women and the only reason that wouldn’t happen is cause men make up like 99% of world governments and military.

You know the reason men react in such a negative way towards feminism is cause we fear for our lives which feminism is putting at risk more and more each day with its words and actions.

You know men are hurt and are acting like women do when their rights and lives are being threatened.

And most importantly you know feminism is the biggest threat to men today and you know you could do something to help men

Yet you choose to support and even defend feminism then choose to tell us men that we’re wrong for reacting to attacks on their well being, we’re wrong for despising feminism, we’re wrong for going “oh boy” whenever someone says they’re a feminist etc.

Sorry if this sounds a little harsh but saying you support my rights yet you claim you stand with and support the people who took them away from me doesn’t make you sound credible or trustworthy in any capacity, if you truly were for men’s rights you’d acknowledge that feminism is the last thing men will stand with or for and stop associating yourself with a clearly sexist and deceptive movement.”",1614733524

This is of course not true, and the real etymology for the phrase comes from a practice of using the length or width of your thumb as a unit of measure.

You'd be surprised just how many people believe this to be true though.  The idea that men could legally beat their wives is a cornerstone of feminist dogma that they've tried to push for decades.  The evidence for this practice, however, is basically non-existent.  There are a couple court cases from the 1800s where men have seemingly gotten away with hitting their wives, but it has never actually been a legal practice under US law or under English common law.

And even those court cases that some feminists try to cite seem fairly lackluster. In one such case, the husband was found innocent due to a lack of bruising or marks on his wife.  Which feminists try to interpret as, ""it was fine so long as you didn't beat your wife too severely"".  Even if such a husband did get away with hitting his wife, clearly it was still a crime since it was prosecuted. And the reason he was found innocent came down to a lack of evidence, not because there was a misogynistic loophole that he took advance of.  

Other court cases ruled on interpretations of English common law, which is taken to help legitimize the idea that some form of wife abuse used to be legal. However, those court rulings consistently found insufficient evidence to justify an exception, including for cases of ""mild discipline of your wife"".  Which if anything seems like evidence against this, not in favor of it.

Domestic violence wasn't explicitly outlawed in the US at a federal level until the early 1900s, which is another talking point you see about this. But it was still illegal at the state level going back to the 1600s. And would have also been illegal under regular assault laws. This is because there weren't any legal exceptions granted to husbands to assault their wives the way feminists like to say there were.

Even more damning is that wife abuse (but not husband abuse) carried with it very cruel and unusual punishments throughout most of history.  Under one law, a husband accused of beating his wife would be buried with just his head left above the ground so that his wife could do whatever she wanted to him in retribution.

In fact it was actually husband abuse, not wife abuse, that used to be legal in history.  Under some laws, a wife was not only allowed to beat her husband, but if she did, it was used as evidence that the husband had actually done something wrong and needed to be punished *even more*.  The assumption is that he had to have done something to piss her off bad enough to hit him.  And him making her mad, but not her hitting him out of anger, was deemed to be a crime.  Under some versions of this law, the punishment for making your wife angry enough to hit you included being drug throughout town by horses.

The expectation, both socially and legally, was that husbands were supposed to be subservient to their wives, not the other way around.

So not only is this feminist view lacking in evidence, but the very opposite of it seems to have been true.  

Here is a source I've been using for this for a while:

######The ""Great Taboo"" and the Role of Patriarchy in Husband and Wife Abuse

https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+%22great+taboo%22+and+the+role+of+patriarchy+in+husband+and+wife+abuse-a0165430144

Not only does it go into the background of this controversy, the authors analyzed a bunch of papers that claim that wife abuse used to be legal to show that their citation trails basically go nowhere.  The only legitimate primary source is something written in the 1700s by Sir William Blackstone, an English judge. He claimed that someone told him that you could use moderate discipline on your wife at some distant point in the past, but even he couldn't find a reference to it in older law books. He then went on to say that such a thing would be obviously illegal in modern times (meaning in 1700s England).  Thus apparently refuting the claim in the very source that is commonly cited as evidence for it.  Modern historians have of course found no evidence for this, either.

Like a lot of things you come across in the context of gender and gender equality, I was expecting this to be fairly unknown outside of the men's community.  Obviously there are academic references but just because you have sources doesn't mean it's widely known about.

On a whim I decided to check out Wikipedia, just to see how this was handled there.  And I was surprised to find that not only was this mentioned as a myth, but the article itself went into a good bit of detail over the history of this revisionist claim.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb

Clearly there's been a bit of ""debate"" that's played out on this page, given the length of discussion that's afforded to this just in the intro section (where it goes back and forth with a few feminist talking points sprinkled in here or there). But ultimately the facts have prevailed.

What I found interesting is just how much time, energy, and money feminists have put into making this seem like a legitimate fact.  To quote Wikipedia,

&gt;In the 20th century, public concern with the problem of domestic violence declined at first, and then re-emerged along with the resurgent feminist movement in the 1970s.[3] The first recorded link between wife-beating and the phrase *rule of thumb* appeared in 1976, in a report on domestic violence by women's-rights advocate Del Martin:

&gt;&gt;For instance, the common-law doctrine had been modified to allow the husband 'the right to whip his wife, provided that he used a switch no bigger than his thumb'—a rule of thumb, so to speak.[5]

&gt;While Martin appears to have meant the phrase *rule of thumb* only as a figure of speech, some feminist writers treated it as a literal reference to an earlier law.[5][19] The following year, a book on battered women stated:

&gt;&gt;One of the reasons nineteenth century British wives were dealt with so harshly by their husbands and by their legal system was the 'rule of thumb'. Included in the British Common Law was a section regulating wifebeating [...] The new law stipulated that the reasonable instrument be only 'a rod not thicker than his thumb.' In other words, wifebeating was legal.[20]

&gt;Despite this erroneous reading of the common law (which is a set of judicial principles rather than a written law with individual sections) the spurious legal doctrine of the ""rule of thumb"" was soon mentioned in a number of law journals.[3][7] The myth was repeated in a 1982 report by the United States Commission on Civil Rights on domestic abuse titled ""Under the Rule of Thumb"", as well as a later United States Senate report on the Violence Against Women Act.[3]

&gt;In the late 20th century, some efforts were made to discourage the phrase *rule of thumb*,[7] which was seen as taboo owing to this false origin.[3] Patricia T. O'Conner, former editor of the *New York Times* Book Review, described it as ""one of the most persistent myths of political correctness"".[5] During the 1990s, several authors wrote about the false etymology of *rule of thumb*, including the conservative social critic Christina Hoff Sommers,[3] who described its origin in a misunderstanding of Blackstone's commentary.[12] Nonetheless, the myth persisted in some legal sources into the early 2000s.[3]

There are other myths floating around out there as well.  For example it is often said that you could beat your wife on certain days of the week or in certain locations (commonly the courthouse steps on Sunday).

Despite being widely repeated and endorsed by feminists, as near as I can tell, that one is a myth also:

https://www.thisismysouth.com/11-unusual-outdated-southern-laws/

So why make these efforts to rewrite history?

And what does it say about your ideology that you have to make things up to help legitimatize it?

This isn't the only area that feminists have engaged in historical revisionism.  Other examples include the nature of coverture under English common law (a type of marriage), the treatment of women as literal slaves to men, and of course the history of the movement itself.  ""First wave feminism"" and ""second wave feminism"" weren't actually older incarcerations of feminism. Most of those people didn't call themselves feminists and they definitely wouldn't have agreed with modern feminist ideology. However a great deal of time and effort has been made to appropriate their accomplishments under the banner of feminism.

The good news is that a lot more attention has been given to this recently.  Sources are easier to come by and there have even been a couple books written by impartial historians about this (including at least one book, *The Privileged Sex*, where the author went in to it under the assumption that women were oppressed, and was surprised to find just how incorrect of a view that is).

Facts can't be hidden forever.  You can try to rewrite history all you want, but people are going to find the truth when they actually go looking for it.",1614700612

1273,MensRights,"A few months ago we were gathered in a flat chilling. A few men and women. People started drinking and having fun, dancing... Not one person in the room was drunk by definition cause most had to work the next day . I recall the story better than anyone because I was the only one who didn't drink, because I simply don't drink and I could see whether someone was getting out of hand. Wasn't the case from start to finish.

The 2 started making out aggressively and full of passion just in front of me and they went to the 1st room on the left. Every room was connected to the living room, so you could hear what was happening in any room even if you didn't want to. They just started having sex and were loud doing their thing, both dirty talking. I can't tell you exactly what they said cause I wasn't paying attention but that tone of voice was dirty talking undoubtedly.

Fast forward, a couple of days ago, I heard that there's a rumour going around town (I don't live in that town but I used to, so I spend time there) regarding that night (their hookup). Her friends apparently asked her whether it was true that she hooked up with him and she allegedly said that she was too drunk and remembers having sex but not even with who. Which is absolute bs. The friends told her that that's assault and are persuading her to take action without even trying to ask her anything related. Both were in immaculate condition, my friend isn't what you would deem as popular and apparently only I and another girl knew they hooked up. She's  refusing to take legal action but they keep persuading her.

I'm 100% sure that her intention wasn't to get to this point but more like to give an excuse as to why she fucked the nerdy guy no one fucks, it backfired and now she probably doesn't know how to manage the situation or is willing to admit it. I spoke to her very politely and told her that I was there sober and she didn't seem to be drunk whatsoever and nobody did drugs. She said that she doesn't want to go forward with the law but she was drunk. I didn't argue cause what's the point? I know that she knows the law isn't something to make a joke about and that the truth will get out there and will destroy her and her reputation like it is doing to my friend right now.

The guy is scared shitless because even though he knows myself and the other girl would come forward if necessary, anything can happen if they end up persuading her. The town is divided. Most women haven't even questioned him and are assuming he assaulted her and the other half of people trust the facts that I gave them. To me this isn't a matter of friendship. If I heard anything odd whatsoever I would have undoubtedly walked in the room and see what's going on. Wasn't the case and now the guy can't even sleep just from thinking about it. What would you guys suggest?",1614488775

1290,MensRights,"I want equality, not the roles to be reversed. I don't want men to be victimized the way women were 100s of years ago (worth based on criteria, used to be birthing a son for women, now men have to make $$ and shut up) 

Funny things my husband and I know more men falsely accused of being abusers or harassers/rapists than women who were raped/harrassed. At least 2 of husband's former colleagues got ripped to the bones in a divorce.

I have always told my husband if we divorce I am okay 50/50 custody and actually I don'twant full custody, I don't want his money or his 401k. All I would ask is that he gives me time to get myself comfortably out and a portion of my share of the house because I wouldn't want it to be sold (VA loan and he has to live in it) through a cash out refinancing which seems fair. We both care about our children and one spouse ripping the finances of the other, spending all their assets into lawyers and court would be making our children even more miserable than needed, divorce is tough on them.

I have experienced sexism but honestly don't feel like the world is against me. If anything I have been given a harder time by other women. I prefer male doctors, yes even Obgyn (my son was delivered by one and I was so pissed when he moved to another state when I was expecting my daughter. The best doctor I ever had) 

In all honesty I am not afraid for my daughters (6yo) future, but my son (9yo). How do I protect him once he gets older, as early as middle school from those bitches that play the feminist card taught by their karen mothers. How do protect him from someone falsely accusing him just because he dared asking her out, or he broke up with her and she wants revenge. How do i make sure he doesn't get trapped because one decided to stop using her BC and got pregnant to keep him? 

I am not afraid about teaching my daughters to stand up for herself if she ever encounters some jerk (because they exist, feminists use these to justify their movement) 
I also know teaching respect to my son is important because I don't want him to listen to negative influences that some friends could bring (both genders have these) but I don't want him to be a pushover either who gets victimized because he made a joke that some female decided to label as""sexist"". 

The only thing I could side with feminists is about abortion. Old men politicians and religious folks better stay out of my body when making laws. I also believe abortion rights protect males who get trapped into an unwanted pregnancy. Sadly there are stories of women who get pregnant (stop taking birth control)to keep the guy. We all know that doesn't work, for the boys safety they need a way out when they realize their mistake. 

I am a woman who doesn't let anyone walk over her, men and women together. I hate women whose definition of equality is men persecution the same way I hate sexist pigs. And idc if some guy looks at my a.. (make sure my husband doesn't see you though), I check good looking men too. I tease my husband on hot males like Jason momoa, Chris Hemsworth the same way he teases me about Katty perry or scarlet Johanson. If anything women are more perverse than men (even though I agree porn depiction of women is gross). 

Just wanted you to know. We re not all bad!

Let's not diminish the fight of feminists who did so in good faith, we don't want to be accused of ""patriarchy"". I am also pro choice and I want to help men who got the wrong end of the stick handed to them because a woman screwed him over.

1333,MensRights,"**This is a long post and I didn't add tl;dr, because I need to explain everything briefly. I am sorry for no tl;dr, but discussing these issues are very important to understand and help men's mental issues.**

We all know that a man's status can differ. They can be working class, they can be white collar working class, they can be rich or they can be middle class. Yet, the society not only compare men within their socio-economic class, but also compare men within different classes, a ""cross-class"" comparement.

At the end, the measurement will be done by looking at two things: How much the men earns, and how many partners they get. You can achieve something great scientifically, you will be headlines for once. Eventually, if you can't turn it into huge money or investment, you will be forgotten. 

This is not only done by men, but women also values men based on these things. After all, we are a society and every gender is part of the society they live in. 

 This is a huge problem. Men who can barely sustain their life plus not getting laid are suicidal. Yes. They feel weak, worthless and complete failures. Men who can sustain their life can cope a little, while men who can sustain their life and get married without divorce can also cope enough. Marriage is somehow viewed as a ""success"" by society, even by most progressive ones. Somehow marrying resets your past mistakes, and you are baptised by marriage. The man gets a life-long partner, so he must be succesful; that's one of the highest levels of success for working class men. If they can manage to avoid huge debts, may be buying a house with debt or mortgage, get their children in school and get them jobs and marriages, they will reach their peak level of success. 

Now, of course if their children can get into middle class, that will be beyond their realistic goals. Anyways. My point is, to feel successful, secure, worthful and complete, a men has sets of tasks given to them by society. To be worthy, you need to complete them. Each men, according to their socio-economic class, has different sets of tasks. And all link to earning money and getting laid.

We all know incels, or heard about them. If we break down their psychology, or ""lonely man"" psychology in general, we can find that most lonely man, even if they are surrounded by people, can't feel ""complete"". They lack the satisfaction. We, humans, have an evolutionary response for loneliness, or not accepted by society: depression. This feeling is a defence mechanism of body to stop doing acts that secludes them from society. Still, if you are successful at work and have a social life, but can't get satisfacted for varying reasons, you will feel lonely. And this loneliness eventually lead to depression.

Yes. Getting laid won't make you more men, and not getting laid won't make you a lesser men. I did have many partners and girlfriends, but it shouldn't be the main focus of our lives. I see many young men feel bad for not being able to get a girlfriend. That shouldn't bother you, but the system and society wants you to feel bad. It is designed in that way, and our one of the first struggle shall be against these norms. Men shouldn't be valued by how much they earn and how many partners they can find.

Also, we all know what this means. To get more money, you either need to be rich because money attracts money, or you need to get in a good earning job. Otherwise, like if you are the clerk at McDonalds cashier, you are doomed. And, to get partners, our today's society is very ""lookist."" I see many men being rejected because of them being at medium or short height, or not being very well looking. Money can cover up all of them, but if you don't have money, then your look really matters. The system doesn't only forces men. They also make women think they are worthless unless they get the best partner for themselves. Like I said before, the society is not made up by a single gender, and both gender are victims of this system and society. This is why we all dream about a united struggle, a solidarity where men and women fight for their worth and rights against the system. 

Now, let's talk about reasons of these problems in a very summarized way:

**Reasons:**

 To breakdown these reasons, societal norms are not enough to explain everything. The capitalistic world, where there is an illusion of choice, freedom and ""competition"", makes everything worse. There is no denying that capitalism uses every method to ensure it's own safety, profit and presence, and has no shame into destroying lives, souls and environment in the process. There is no freedom of choice, but we are raised to believe that we have. Getting different unhealthy snacks from supermarkets is not freedom of choice. We don't have freedom after all; we can't get in the hermit life just like that. Ensuring survival and living in harmony with nature is near impossible in today's world. The most brutal truth about it was colonisation of Africa. You can never be left alone in any corner of the world. And finally, the illusion of ""competition.""  
   
There is no competition. We ""compete"" with each other to be best servants of their system. They don't want you to start up your own small business and live peacefully. They want everything to serve in their economic mechanism that allows them to earn most, and be the dominant class. If you can get into their chamber, you are welcome. Otherwise, we are all equally piece of shits, and will be treated in that way. We will compete with each other, harm each other, block each other or even plot against each other. So, only the ones who can serve better will rank up. And most of us, I mean almost none of us will be CEO of McDonalds who earns millions of dollars per year.  

And men are also got into the plastic surgery trap. This is a market, and it targeted women first. They made women feel inferior and worthless when they weren't just like celebrities they presented. Celebrities are one of the aristocratic establishments of capitalism. Their main task is to set up the standards for society, and make it look like those standards are mere average. Being 10/10? It's just average. They don't even get any plastic surgery(!), they just drink lots of water. Yes, they targeted women first like I said. Women who felt worthless because they couldn't meet these standards of course tried plastic surgery, so they could feel better. It's not their fault, and we should be fair about it because sometimes I see people blaming women for these stuffs. It's not their fault. 

Now, men are being targeted by this beauty market. Buy products to look handsome. Get your nose and chin done. Get some more jawline. Because outlook and money are all that matters. Nothing else has any meaning in todays society, and we are both slaves and consumerists of the system.

Thanks for reading. I hope we can help our fellow brothers with their mental issues. We should encourage them. We should tell them that not getting laid or not earning much is totally ok. They need to find things that they love in this world, and get on the track. Don't let the system and society ruin everything. It is a fight against the world designed to make us suffer, and we are all veterans of this war.",1614852498

1345,MensRights,"First incident was when I was 16. I was trying to be friendly with a kid out in public, and his Mom grabbed him away and gave me the filthiest look ever. 

Now I know to most people that would seem like a harmless minor incident that should be ignored. But think about the implication: I was just labeled as a PEDOPHILE.

And another time was when my friend brought his girlfriend over, and she'd keep getting annoyed/uncomfortable every time I looked in her direction. And then I had to consciously divert my gaze away from her and now think about where I was looking. 

And I was once walking out in the street at night and this girl walking in front of me burst out into a run and starting running forwards. 

And during university, there were a couple of girls who'd actively avoid me (I once offered a seat next to me to one of them and they ignored me and walked to the other side of the classroom). All because I was an introvert who wasn't outgoing. Girls don't like reserved quiet guys (unless they're Robert Pattison). 

I know to most people these might seem like minor harmless issues. But my self esteem is nowhere near as pristine as it was when I was a 15 year old. All of these years of '' women trying to be safe '' has  damaged my self esteem. And I know I'm not the only one, a lot of men have endured this. 

I used to know another guy with Aspergers who would always avoid women because he was afraid of '' creeping them out ''.",1614830393

1350,MensRights,"E: Oops. Male sexuality that is attracted to women, in some form, that is.

**Disclaimer**: I didn't feel like making a million fucking ""sarcasm"" quotation marks, apply them as necessary while reading. lol

This is hypocrisy in the purest form, they use old anti-porn feminist arguments and logic when dealing with issues that relate to female sexualization through the male gaze, and call it objectifying and dehumanizing, and yet they switch over to sex-positive arguments and logic when it comes to their own sexualization and self-objectification, insisting that it is healthy or even empowering when a woman chooses to do it, regardless of the circumstances or context. The issue is that those anti-porn arguments are fundamentally sexist, and sex-negative against women, they imply that women are inherently demeaned by their own sexuality relative to a male's.

Yet, this sexist logic that concludes women are sexually inferior to men, is allowed to be weaponized against us and to shame our own natural biology, without implying anything negative towards women. They will assert that they are being sexualized in ways that are inherently sexist, that sexuality itself isn't the problem, it is because we view them as sexual objects, but this is nothing but bullshit assumptions. A woman being objectified is seen as more harmful than a man, because of the implied sexual shame for women. Women were primarily valued for their looks, femininity, and domestic role long before the sexual revolution ever took place.

Now, just to clarify, I want to express that my issue is that they simply twist their ideology to benefit themselves at every turn, I am against the ludicrous double standard that this represents. I am not in favor of shaming men or women for sex, just because we have different biology. I want to create a more sex-positive and equal society, apparently much more so than feminists do. Feminists want to hide behind their victim status when it is convenient, and put unnecessary suffering onto men in the process. I can't express how fucking insane it is that their whole theory of objectification is widely accepted, despite being a mess of contradictions.",1614825132

when boys go into puberty and start looking for more mature content, they will pop into those YouTubers who do low effort Reddit videos and reaction videos but they will show off cleavage. this in itself is not an issue, and younger boys seeing this is also not a big deal, but I feel they should understand what is happening. you know that they are feeling arousal or attraction to said YouTubers. but they don't know that, and whether this is predatory and manipulative is another topic altogether. you see I fell into this trap of not understanding why I watched these YouTubers because at the time I was watching another more interesting and understandable Reddit YouTuber who made real content. I did not understand the feelings I felt towards these YouTubers and I think that that isn't good. I also see my younger brother finding these YouTubers and I think that boys should have the information to understand what is happening. also, some personal things are happening with my brother that are very personal and I will not share even though you guys have had the same thing. also, mods if you don't like can you direct me to a place where the mods will like this post.

TLDR: younger boys entering puberty are attracted to female YouTubers who show off their bodies (and that's fine of course) but they don't understand and they also go through personal changes they won't understand until captain hindsight tells them.

1408,MensRights,"So basically I was a temp at this job, and there was a woman there who seemed a little interested in me as something more than a friend. I do have above average looks so I'm not too unfamiliar with this happening to me. But I had a girlfriend and this woman coworker of mine was 10 years older than me at the time and divorced. Anyways I got to know her over the weeks and one day she invited me to her house for dinner. I accepted because she had been very nice to me and I know she's a good cook. When I got there she gave me a glass of wine which was laced with some kind of roofie that made me become something of a vegetable but still conscious. After about half an hour the roofie kicked in and she started with the raping. When she was done she also took what I can only assume was another roofie because she laid down on the floor and soon she was in the same state that I was. A couple hours later I started being able to move fully again and I left while she was sleeping, probably high as fuck. 

I decided not to be a pussy about that and on Monday I talked to my female boss who just sat there and smiled and sometimes giving me the ""are you stupid enough to think I'll believe that?"" look while I told her this story. I wasn't too emotionally scarred by the incident itself, honestly my biggest concern was that my girlfriend might find out and dump me. But after I had told my story I could tell my boss was about to start laughing but she said she would talk with my rapist about this. Her office had glass walls and I was looking into that room and could see my rapist crying. I though that she had been fired and that was the end of that. But no. I get called back into my boss's office and she locked the door when I got in. Then she told me that she had called the police and that I were to wait in her office until they arrived to take me away for rape. 

Fast forward a bit and I'm in jail, and no one believed my story. Not the interrogation officer, not the arresting officer and not even my family and friends. The only one that believed me was my girlfriend and her parents. Luckily they were rich and could afford a good lawyer. 

I also had the luck to get a fair judge and jury who eventually gave me a non guilty verdict. Now what did the rapist get who drugged me with an illegal substance before raping me? A promotion and a TV interview about speaking up against rape. What did I get? Kicked out of my apartment, fired from my job and probably have little to no hope to get a good job in the future.

1409,MensRights,"In honor of international women's day, I would like to post some of my conclusions following several years of research on feminism, men's rights, and the gender war.

1) What group is primarily hurt by the division of men and women resulting in the fragmentation of the family?

It is the lower classes, who depend upon the cooperation of individuals, who are primarily hurt by any loss of social cohesion. The more money a person has at their disposal, the more insulated that individual is from the effects of social deterioration. They can simply purchase what they need and throw money at any problems that come their way. The less money you have, the more you need the cooperation of others for survival, even more so to thrive. 

The upper classes have a long history of using social issues to fragment the lower classes, one prominent example is the widespread use of race baiting on syndicated news programs, who despite any claims to the contrary, serve as nothing more than mouthpieces of the ruling economic elites. Multinational corporate support of feminism, serves this function and any divide in the family hits at the heart of the functionality of the working class as anything more than simple wage slaves- a condition that corporate interests require to maintain a philosophy of endless growth.

2) What group benefits primarily from the division of men and women, resulting in the fragmentation of the family?

Since the rise of feminism, the average wage of the working class, adjusted for inflation, has stagnated (if not dropped). At the same time, the productivity of multinational corporations has steadily increased to the point that certain individuals in the economic elite have as much money if not more than the federal government. At the same time, social programs that benefit the working class have been systematically cut, things like school funding, welfare programs, social security, and unemployment insurance (all providing valuable safety nets and resources), in order to fund systematic cuts to the taxes paid by these individuals and institutions. So long as they are divided against each other along the lines of race and gender, the lower classes cannot mount an effective defense against the squeeze. With this ungodly wealth the elites now have at their disposal, it is an easy thing to buy off the government to turn a blind eye to their enslaving, usurious practices. From the legalization of corruption through citizen's united to the outright theft of elections, the government is now their strong arm. 

From this, we can clearly see what feminism is: an ideology co-opted by multinational corporations and the economic elite to hobble the working class and strong arm them into perpetual wage slavery in order to maintain a philosophy of unlimited growth.

So, MRA's

Don't expect the government to support you.

Don't expect wealthy corporations to support you.

When you fight for men's rights, you are not just fighting for men's rights but also against their will to power. Expect  resistance. Expect to be vilified. You are what they fear most- men standing in unity.",1615232499

Correct me if I'm wrong, but in order for a female to ""produce"", a man would need to fertilize the egg. Without men, it would be impossible to fertilize the egg and both women and men would both go extinct.

At the time, Gillette executives defended this atrocity and crafted bizarre ideological explanations fuled by the support of the puppet feminist media, but after millions in loses and a huge criticizism Gillette was forced to shift their advertising and ditch their misandrist focus, at least for now.

1485,MensRights,"I'm new to this sub, but after being severely abused by two romantic partners in my life, I've become much more personally involved with men's rights. I might get into it in future posts but here's my current concern...  


Just now on facebook, I saw a post telling us to teach men to not normalize touching women's waists as you pass them by. I've never personally done this or felt a need, and of course touching someone like that shouldn't be accepted, but I've become admittedly jaded. Yes, I agree it shouldn't be done, but the wording of the post came off as bigoted and demonizing to men. I immediately thought: what about all the women I've known that say ""excuse me"" once, and then proceed to push the man out of the way before he even has time to react.

It's not just they they push past them, they do it aggressively. What I observe is that the specific women who do this enter the situation expecting to be disrespected. The last time I saw this was at a bar, and a man was standing talking to a group of friends. The woman said excuse me and he obviously didn't hear her, simple as that. She perceived it as him purposefully ignoring/disrespecting her, and proceeded to elbow him out of the way. No one said anything, no one did anything. They allowed it to happen and let her get away with it without consequence. To me, this normalizes it, because the woman who got away with it leaves the situation feeling as if she's in the right, because no one told her it was wrong.   


It's funny to me, because society views men as the aggressors, but in my experience, most of the aggression and hostility I've experienced has come from women. Now, obviously I'm not saying this to diminish violence women have experienced, I'm simply describing something men experience and nothing more. In hindsight, I see men being physically pushed around a lot; concerts, bars, and subways to name a few. It's not necessarily an every day occurrence, but it happens enough that I notice it, and no one seems to care enough to speak out about it. 

Has anyone else noticed this trend? I know for a fact I wouldn't appreciate being elbowed, and I sure as hell am not out to disrespect anyone. If I don't move, it's because I didn't hear you.",1614896742

1489,MensRights,"So me and my friend had a discussion today. (We focused on US, and excluded third world countries as women have it worse there)

It was about the topic if there should also be a month dedicated to men.

I was on the side that there should be, to not create a toxic gap between both of the genders, to bring awareness to mens problems as well.

Whether it would be sort of awareness month or just mens history month, or something of this sort.

My friend however said that men don't deserve this kind of a thing.

As they didn't suffer enough compared to women.

My points were divorce cases, men being forced to go to war, false abuse or rape accusations, suicide rates, or just how media don't cover as much of the problems that men face as women do.

Over time it went from talking about if there should be a month like that to an argument of whether men's issues are equal to female issues.

It got to the point where there were 2 sides.

Mine: Both genders issues should be treated equally, and we should aspire to solve both of them.

My friends: We should prioritise women issues over mens.

I said that we should be prioritising both genders problems as postponing the other genders problems would only make society root from the inside.

But I guess having this opinion makes me an incel.

Guess we should only focus on female problems, and ignore the struggles that males have to face in the current day.

**Take into consideration it could be biased from my side, as we both got frustrated at each other that argument.**

So what do you think? 

Edit: I just wanted to say this because its been stressing me today. Im allowed to study online or in person. I study online and my friend studies in person. We had the discussion on a discord call. I just don't want rumours of me being an incel spreading, and me not being able to do anything.",1614890763

 Is it not okay to talk about paternity?

In one post I brought up that a school project had children get their parents blood types. It turned out that 30% of the children were not the father's biological children. People freaked out trying to shame me for posting that.

In a different post I brought up the 23 and me (also other DNA matching companies) it is speculated that overall the number is near 30% of the people who were not related to their father's.

I mentioned in both of these posts and others that it is speculated as there has not been an actually study. People still flip out.

Is it wrong to know if your child is your genetic legacy?

At home paternity tests are not all that expensive and I am curious about how many men are paying child support for another man's legacy.

I am sick of women getting all of the attention. Oh here are some statistics on women who are abused per day. Here is the number of women raped each month. Here is - women women women women women women women.

When the hell are men going to start to be able to talk about their issues? The United Nations even tweeted out on International Men's Day about women and a big ol' thank you to men who SUPPORT WOMEN.

Fuck women.

Oh yeah. And I was homeless for a bit after I decided being homeless would be better than being psychologically, economically, and drugged my way into forced sex. Ironically?

They'll also have various counselling rounds for women for the following things:

* Personal stories of top management 
* Leadership talk
* Inspirational - ""Dare to be different""

A few weeks ago **the HRs** organized an entire day for **women employees' development**:

* Being assertive at work (even more than they already are)
* Work-life balance
* How to say no
* Followed by counselling rounds for them

These events are **exclusively for women**. I call **BS** on this. Just how much more are we going to empower these bit\*\*es? 

And most of the women employees that I've personally met in the software industry are **extremely F'ing NEEDY!** They need help with the manuals, help with what work needs to be done, they need help with emotions as well! I know that that sounds cliched and you might not believe me but I've experienced this first hand!

And lastly, **they don't want to acknowledge** taking the help. You sit with them for an hour helping them/mentoring them for a fucking technical task that they were supposed to figure out on their own. And at the end there is no real gratitude. They're like ""Yeah, it's your job to explain to me"". No bitch! It ain't my job to spoonfeed you! It's your job to figure things out. Just like the f'ing rest of us.

1629,MensRights,"Hey lads, first time caller long time listener here. 

As the title says, I fell down a reddit rabbit hole, found /r/superstraight and I'm interested to hear if anyone's been watching this and what thoughts they had, if any. I followed it for a couple of days and.. whew. I'm happy to be off the wild ride now, I think the sub has been shut down as of a few hours ago - I was just about done anyway - but must admit it was a guilty pleasure to follow and there was just *something* intriguing about watching the sub devolve in a matter of days (hours?) as far as I can tell.

For anyone out of the loop, I *believe* (and stand to be corrected on any of this) the whole ""movement"" is less than 2 weeks old. It apparently was started by a Tiktok user by the name of Kyle Royce, who posted about being guilted and called out by others over being attracted exclusively to women who were born female, and I believe he coined the term ""superstraight"" at that point. This meant acknowledging that trans women are indeed women and that if you're a straight man you're attracted to them just as much as any other type of women by default, hence the need for this new term to specify that as a heterosexual man you're only attracted to biological women and this makes you ""superstraight"" as it were. This ended up catching the guy a lot of flak and he was called out as transphobic etc. 

This is where I'm a bit hazy on the details - I really thought the subreddit was formed as a tongue-in-cheek response to the über woke reaction calling this guy out, but in essence wasn't to be taken overly seriously - they were using the abbreviation 'SS' for God's sake of course I thought it was a joke! I saw posts calling out ""superphobes"" and calling for superstraights to band together and unite for a greater good - it was a parody a-la the Super Best Friends in South Park - there was no way this was 100% for real. I saw it as shining a light on the ridiculousness of the extent woke culture has gone to and holding up a mirror to their cause with a ""cause"" of their own. I was into it because I genuinely don't think anyone should be given shit over who they are and aren't attracted to, or who they should be *allowed* be attracted to, and thought the ironic shitposts and memery was an ""up yours"" to anyone trying to guilt straight dudes telling them what to do - but also just saw it as a good time as I procrastinate on reddit. 

Soon it wasn't just straight dudes anymore, there were superstraight girls posting ""transitioning"" pics going from non pregnant to pregnant, people posting aryan looking ""super"" families, then supergays, superbis even supertrans (trans who were only attracted to trans) but hey the more the merrier we're just having a good time here. Lots and lots of superlesbians posting, I was still assuming at this point that there was a comedic air to all of this. People would post and ask if the sub was for real and of course people would respond that it was a legitimate sub, keeping in line with what I thought was the spirit of the sub, I even responded to one myself to assure someone that ""we"" were legit! Another time I suggested we have our own flag emojis - I said it thinking it would add an obnoxious authenticity to the movement but I think people thought it was unironically a good idea and it got something like 100 upvotes lol 

Extremely quickly the mood on the sub changed, terms like TERFs were being thrown around (Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists) posts were made about trans women raping biological lesbian women by coercing them into sex under the guise of being a fellow biological woman. Charity posts for women's shelters that banned trans women were posted and stickied. Someone commented with a link to a men's shelter that reached the top of the post and the OP responded that their focus would be on the women's shelter for now and that they wanted to concentrate on one at a time, to give people a break in between asking for donations. I didn't know that the sub had become a channel for fundraising or who the OP was as an authority to tell anyone who their money should go to while disregarding the other charity but the priority was stated clearly. 

I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but the penny had dropped at this stage that this was something else now, it looked like a hostile takeover from the remnants of the ""lgb drop the t"" crowd trying to make their reddit comeback. A quick Google and I saw a post on Ovarit from feminists who were rallied behind the superstraight cause for their own reasons but were giving a stark reminder to their own that straight dudes were appalling in general and that any allied common interest was an unfortunate coincidence. They were not to join in with the memes and humour because the straight dudes didn't care enough about women's rights or radical feminism and that women could not be funny in their eyes anyway. 

Tl;Dr - Piss-takey subreddit suggesting straight guys should be allowed choose who they wanna be with in the form of memes and shitposts becomes subject of hostile takeover by radical feminists within days who enforce their own agenda astonishingly quickly and lead to the sub having a transition of its own, sucking any and all fun out of it turning it into a dour, political black hole for humour. Men resume their rightful place as cause of all pain and suffering and are asked to fund a women's shelter shortly before the sub is driven into the ground altogether.",1615377013

I've noticed that a few of the men on here get obsessed with the level of hate and inequality that gets levelled towards men, and that's fair, but you gotta stay away from toxic communities like the feminism ones on here and in other places. In exposing yourself to all that hate, every day, you will be impacted by it. Men, please take care of yourselves. Have open and honest discussion here and in other spaces that are actually interested in equality, but when you go to those other forums that are only interested in female supremacy you will be shat upon from dizzying heights, and I can only assume that's what you might be looking for, because at this point you shouldn't be expecting that conversation to go differently. You're actively seeking out people who hate you, stop it, just live a good life, do good work, and take care of your communities. Toxic ideologies like feminism always die, it might be popular today, but a lot of hateful things used to be popular, all you have to do is keep speaking up for yourself in your every day life. Think of it this way, a black person making an impassioned speech about racial equality at a KKK rally is stupid because no one there is interested in their views and in fact actively hates them for being black, so making impassioned equality speeches and paragraphs in feminism groups is stupid because they do not care about men's rights and in fact actively hate you for being a man who loves himself.

Recently, a commenter here asserted false accusations don't ""stick"". Well, misandrists and media have dined upon the Farrow false accusations for decades.   

For fun and profit, a new docuseries revives already-debunked accusations by one Alison Strickland:    
https://www.yahoo.com/news/nanny-witnessed-woody-allen-disturbing-224546757.html

&gt;The nanny who first testified that she saw Woody Allen behaving inappropriately with a young Dylan Farrow has spoken out about the incident for the first time in decades amid the airing of a new documentary series.    

But Moses Farrow debunked Stickland years ago:   
https://levine2001.medium.com/the-woody-allen-controversy-reader-why-maureen-orths-10-undeniable-facts-about-the-woody-allen-5f26791c15a0   
&gt;The sitter, Alison Stickland, is the only one who claims to have seen this.
  
&gt;Moses Farrow completely destroys the facially ridiculous notion that Allen would choose to molest Dylan in full view of everyone in house full of witnesses, as Orth implies here.      

&gt;He writes: “Along with five kids, there were three adults in the house, all of whom had been told for months what a monster Woody was. None of us would have allowed Dylan to step away with Woody, even if he tried. Casey’s nanny, Alison, would later claim that she walked into the TV room and saw Woody kneeling on the floor with his head in Dylan’s lap on the couch. *Really? With all of us in there?*""",1615372826

1645,MensRights,"Sorry for the format, and also if is not allowed or correct, but I need to share this.
This time surrounding the march 8th protests in my country put me in a critical point. 
I fully support the critique against the Mexican government for the lack of actions towards violence and their misogynistic behaviour.
Nevertheless, seeing all the hate speech shared in the social media towards men by the common folk, by women that at one moment I considered friends or colleagues... All the media coverage for the protests, also seeing my male friends arguing with my female friends about which gender is more ""victimised"" and how the feminist are too violent or too extremist, made me realize that the problem is not the injustice or violence from one gender to another...

What I realised is that all the modern society is showing the true idea: women's life is instrinsecally worthy. Therefore, all their problems are important, worthy of attention and action to be taken. 
The underlying message also is: Men's life is worthless, men are expendable, therefore their problems can be ignored as there are and there will be more men to fill the gap.

And that's what hurt me the most.

If we raise the banners to protest for men's rights, that our life is worthy, we will find ridicule, jokes and be minimised. That we should man up, that is not a big deal.
We are treated as mere numbers in the statistics.

And that will be my stand point from now on. Not fighting the feminist, not contradicting, but raising awareness on the men Issues, as the feminist did. But not asking for special treatment, only what is fair.",1615355820

There are a lot of people out there especially online that say that white men rule the world and receive extra privileges because of it but I very rarely see this. I have never been treated any different because Im a white dude. Not in school, not in public, not by family or friends. And I have never seen any different treatment of white males compared to other people that was helping the white men. I am even to go out and say sometimes it feels like I get treated worse because I am a white male. For example this post(1), and most of that sub. If I said something like that about women unless I said it to the far right I would become twitters new poster boy to hate, receive a lot of brutal comments, and probably receive a death threat. But she (presumably and i feel its a safe guess) can make fun of a issue that a lot of men face that affects their mental and physical health with encouragement? Now does the porn industry dehumanize women? Yes I agree with that but it also sets unrealistic expectations for men too and I sure as hell have never seen anyone say that. Theres also this post(2) which isnt upsetting but the comments are brutal. Theres one comment that really pisses me off too because its full of lies. ""Because men only ever pretend to care about men's issues when they're trying to shut down conversations about women's issues."" No. Just no. Remember when the boyscouts were shut down over the sexual abuse of boys? I dont know about all men but a lot of the ones I knew were happy that something like that was being put to an end. Then theres the thing that every day is mens day. Im genuinely concerned here. I guarantee you 100% the only men who agree with this are so far to the political right there wives arent allowed to speak unless spoken too and they arent the proudest examples of a man. The last thing is mens mental health. When women post something about depression or anxiety they are called strong and heroic (that isnt a bad thing its a fucking amazing thing) but when I do it somewhere that isnt centered around mental health I see a dramatically less happy comments. Ive been called weak and it hurts. Im expected to be strong and emotionless in public because I am a man.  The mens suicide rate is nearly 3x times higher and the homeless mens population is double. So I sit in bed tonight wondering, is there actually any privilege for men because it doesnt seem like it. Am I overlooking somethings? Maybe being a little dramatic? What do you think reddit?

**Important Note: I am not trying to downplay womens or minorities issues. I see that they too face hurdles in life but in my opinion (white) men are facing large hurdles and  hate. I do not encourage hating on anyone including the comments or the people in the post mentioned above. Do not do that it is a really bad thing to do.**

1676,MensRights,"Everyday I come on here and see more and more posts about how feminism is hurting our cause, or how some dude has been charged with rape, or some dude has been killed today. It's honestly quite depressing to see all this. This sub is now becoming more negative than positive, and we are just proving our hater's assumptions about us correct with how we behave. This place has become less about men's rights and combating the misandry we see on a day-to-day basis, and more for complaining about life's frustrations. We claim to have absolutely no tolerance for misogynists, but there are several MGTOWs who haven't been downvoted to all hell yet. Sooner or later, we won't be any better than r/MGTOW 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, take a quick look at the sidebar. We have for more negative flairs than we do positive flairs. A lot of them haven't even been used enough to appear on the sidebar. Almost every post here are flared as either:

\- Social Issues

\- Discrimination

\- Feminism

\- General

Sometimes you may see a post flared as ""Progress"" or ""Humour,"" but those make up the vast majority. Why do we call ourselves a movement if we aren't doing anything big to benefit our cause? People have already disproven the wage gap, feminism, and even the patriarchy. So if these are the major things standing in our way, why do we not at least try to change it? We have an already solid list of problems men face on a daily basis pinned to the sidebar, as well as an even broader list in our back pockets. Why do we continue talking about how hard life is when we aren't even taking the steps necessary to improve it? And I know that men can't win in today's world, and we'd get hate from incels screaming about how misogynistic we are for being fed up of the bs we face on a daily. But if we band together and protest a lot, we could make this work. Take the Women's Rights Movement as an example. Remember all the boomers shooting them down when they started out? Well, they persevered and managed to succeed at their goals. If they could do it, so can we! Maybe then we'll have less ""Discrimination"" in our feeds and more ""Activism/Support"" and ""Progress""

I'm pretty sure we can all agree that that there are a lot of problems men face that women often don't have to because of gender, I.E: Men commit suicide more often, the majority of homeless people are male, and so-on. But, one thing we, as men, might come to think is that women are born with more entitlement than men, and men have often used that to say that all women are bad. But that's just simply not true.

Now, before you tell me things like, ""Oh! You're one of the lucky ones!"" or, ""Oh! You're probably not even a real male for saying stuff like this!"" let me tell you a little story about myself:

I remember growing up in a small town in Montana, and would go out of town almost every Wednesday night to go to a Christian youth group. However, this circle of cliquey, popular girls, would often tease and prank me, but not on the biases of gender. Instead, they were teasing me because of my mental disability (being Autism). But as much as I know many females that have been like this - and even worse in some cases - I also know many females that aren't even a little like them. Such as my principle, who has given me many amazing opportunities to improve myself, and where I am, and my mom, who has also done just as much as my dad to provide for me (not dissing my pops. Love you dad!)

Also, let us not forget that there are so many women out there, who while speaking for women's rights, have also advocated for ours, like Helly Shah, or Allie Stucky. These brave women, and more, have advocated for us, and risked being labeled as bigots' and traitors for it!

At the end of the day, I know there are a lot of men, who have had a lot of bad experiences with women, and have used those experiences to hold a grudge against all women, but in my experience, that's because they haven't met any women that are better. Trust me, there are better women out there, people! I think my point is, we should judge people based on character, and not their gender.

&amp;#x200B;

""This is one of the reasons why beings like us exist. We may be aliens to this planet, but we still have a responsibility. We have to save them from our war. Even though we are strangers; sometimes, a stranger can be a great teacher. Even a savior… And perhaps soon: It will be up to us to remind them of where they stand. So then they have more knowledge on how to make progress as a civilization, so they can finally be one with each other… Like how we once were… Before the Decepticons… When we were peaceful and just… And I promise you: We will be again peaceful and just.""

I complained at a quote that said that men got away with crimes saying that was completely untrue and its a disgusting thing to say. Men face significant discrimination in the criminal justice system. But the problem is that my mum was a victim of domestic violence. So she sees her experiences in the criminal justice system and when i challenge them I'm essentially delegitimizing her experiences from her point of veiw. When I have conversations with her about these things i try to avoid the subject because i know its something she went through. But whenever i try to explain that I'm not trying to minimise her experience by saying women also commit domestic violence she shuts down and refuses to talk. I'm kinda fine with this more or less because i know she's not trying to be rude or ignore me she just finds the conversation hard.

Not only that but it was apparently done by a male police officer and yet again the feminists are at it saying how women are too afraid to go out at night. I saw one post on Twitter that was a rant about this and it got over 100k likes with people agreeing women are being hurt. Even tho men are the largest victims of violent crime. Clearly this is discrimination. Of course it’s bad she was murdered no doubt, by the bias and blaming of men is absurd.

1751,MensRights,"In the UK at the moment, the disappearance of Sarah Everard has been a huge talking point. This has led to discussions on twitter and other social media outlets over women's safety. One of the most common points raised by women on this issue that I've always struggled with is 'Men need to hold other men accountable for their abusive behaviour' and I've never figured out what they mean by this and how to tackle this particular point.

Where have women gotten the idea that these awful rapists, murderers and violent men are sharing the information of their crimes with their friends (If they have any, the majority of the time the more serious ones are loners) How can we convince women that we are just as clueless as to who in particular we need to be calling out?

The second dilemma I've got is the safety at night thing. All people (Particularly in a city) should be wary at night. I went to Uni in Southampton and I always made sure I was walking home with someone at night or on the phone to someone the whole way home. I've never thought it was a gendered issue, it's just what I've been raised to do to stay safe, in fact it's what my Mother insisted I do.

do you have the glasses from my last post? keep them on.

""**Heterosexual men always have and always will despise women.**""  
well uh thats a bold statement, switch the genders and that sounds like what an incel would say

""It is because they cannot both respect us and be sexually attracted to us, those things are always mutually exclusive.""  
you can respect someone and find them hot

""Their brain just somehow functions so that what they're attracted to sexually always has to be less than.""  
thats not how it works  
nobody sees their significant other as less than or their suboordinate, they see them as, idk, a **significant other?** 

""Heck, the whole Madonna-whore complex is a great example of this mindset. As soon as a woman becomes something he might even respect a little bit (she's still just an object to him, now gone from sexual to motherly), the sexual attraction disappears. ""  
we dont see you as objects. you've been on IncelsWithoutHate.  
you can be attracted to someone you respect - chances are if we dont like you, we dont respect you, no matter how highly you think of yourself. you can be however attractive, but with a personality like that, we dont respect you. if anything, you're 'objectified' when we no longer respect you - we might not like your personality, but we like your body - but if we respect you too, thats not the case

""If a man is sexually attracted to women, he just simply cannot see us as actual human beings. ""  
we recognize you as actual human beings  
like I know you're a real person behind Mutteriman  
I dont think I'd like you but I know you exist  
and there are various girls who I've been equals - even suboordinate - to and attracted to  
both romantically and sexually

  
""It has something to do with power; just think about how much some/many men hate homosexual men, especially the ones who are more submissive and feminine. ""  
we dont hate gay people  
we just don't respect those who dress as a clown **and before you call me out** I mean those who literally look like a clown  
RuPaul is fine, he's just looking feminine  
but the netflix thumbnail for his show has a literal guy with the clown hair and the white powder and all that

""They aren't ""men"" anymore and hence not human. To men, a person cannot be respected if he/she is in a receiving end sexually.""  
to you, maybe

""What makes this all so sad is that women are not like that at all. We've loved men and women all over the world continue to love them in such an innocent and pure way. We believe in romance and deep emotional connections. We are capable of seeing them as more than just objects. ""  
bruh really insulted half the human race and explains how the other half is perfect

""We can have male friends but (heterosexual) men can not fathom the idea of being friends with women; that would mean they'd have to see us as actual human beings first. ""  
just because none of your male friends dont want to be around you doesnt mean they objectify you because you're female  
I assure you its an attitude problem, the same way how incels arent rejected cause they're short - misogyny is bad for getting girls

""They always want to benefit somehow.""  
sex isnt neccesarily a perk though

"" Some might argue that there are so many gold diggers and shallow women, but it's really men who have made us that way. We've been taught to be dependent on men. We've been taught that only our looks and youth matter. How can men complain about a system they created? ""  
you **literally have an entire guide** that states men will immediately leave you if you arent perfect  
**A LITERAL FDS HANDBOOK THAT SAYS THAT**  
**AND IT USES THE SAME WORDS INCELS USE LIKE 'a becky' and 'a chad' I SWEAR**

anyway, have a good one

Context: [https://prnt.sc/10idc23](https://prnt.sc/10idc23)  


the post in question in and of itself (dishonesty in a relationship) is a reasonable issue  
the response, however, is not  


**put on your glasses, you'll need them**

&gt;TLDR: Being a working woman is the goal because if you have your own money, you can leave. SAHM is a precarious position and risky. A HVM can turn low-value after 10, 15, or 20 years. So you should always be financially stable of your own accord. 

okay this is literally saying you should be a career woman so you can leave marriage  
right off the bat  


&gt; Majority of women who stay in abusive relationships do so because they do not have the financial ability to support themselves alone—especially if they have children. Case in point above. 

alright, this is true and to be fair thats a serious issue  


&gt; There also doesn't even have to be abuse. You could wake up one day and realize you have now become a ""mommy bangmaid"" or just plain old realize this is not the life you desire, and newsflash: you need money to leave. 

""he doesnt have to do anything. you can decide that you're a mother who takes care of the house, or realize you just dont like working, and leave""  
this is literal irresponsibility and **exactly** what deadbeat dads do - they decide they dont wanna rise to being a father, and just leave. you cant just decide you dont want to be a mother and walk off  


&gt;Some women on FDS say that if you want to be a SAHM you should have: a rock solid prenup, passive income before marriage, have a stash sufficient for your possible escape.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bullshit, that is not enough.  
&gt;  
&gt;Firstly, that isn't even realistic for most women since majority of households in America need two incomes to survive. In 2017, 54.4% of all household in America were [dual income](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2020/article/comparing-characteristics-and-selected-expenditures-of-dual-and-single-income-households-with-children.htm).  
&gt;  
&gt;Secondly, a woman would need enough money to not just sustain her during a divorce, but for a few years after. Losing out on career advantages and progress derails financial stability. She will need extra time to either go back to school or work her way up the ladder to a wage until she reaches a median salary for the country.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not to mention, no one wants to employ someone with a 10 year gap on their resume—and if they do happen to get hired, it's for well below the average salary. It's been proven statistically that [divorced women are significantly poorer than their married counterparts](http://marripedia.org/effects.of.divorce.on.financial.stability). And while women's livelihood **decreases** after a divorce, men's livelihood **increases** after a divorce.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thirdly, even a HVM is not going to sign a ""rock hard-prenup"" that will entitle his female partner to 85% of all assets. But I'll bite. Who's to say in the culmination of a divorce that he won't hide assets or properties? What will you do if your HVM is no longer a HVM and pulls LVM moves? A HVM can turn low-value after 10, 15, or 20 years. The person you marry is not the same person you divorce.

true  
you need money to leave

&gt;  
Thirdly, even a HVM is not going to sign a ""rock hard-prenup"" that will entitle his female partner to 85% of all assets. 

because its 85%  
this literally isnt even equality or maybe ""60-40 since hes asking you to marry him"" this is outright stupid

&gt; Clearly being a stay-at-home mother isn't working out in our favor—no matter how many women ***desperately*** want to stick to this traditional ideal. 

did someone say **our**?  
**again, working as a class does not help individuals - individualism is why some are better off than others, and you must accept that**

&gt;The *only* way this would work is (1) if you come from a well-off family that provided you with a padded trust fund, (2) you are highly educated in a lucrative, easily employable career (doctor, orthodontist, optometrist, etc), or (3) your husband gives you half of every paycheck.  
&gt;  
&gt;If this isn't you, don't be a SAHM.

if your parents give you money, if you're a doctor, or your husband gives you $0.50 off every dollar he makes

otherwise, dont be a stay at home mother

1785,MensRights,"we all know how feminism wants to claim women are so ""objectified"" and all that and they want to say men are privileged and it's a man's world, stuff like that. they will say they're objectified while we get drafted in wars because we are literally considered disposable. and they'll say they're objectified after leaving a disaster first because of ""women and children"", since men are literally considered disposable. they'll say we are privileged despite nothing being truly catered to us. I get that feminism has some valid points, as does ""meninism"". I mostly advocate for egalitarianism over feminism or ""meninism"" but that's besides the point. 

point is, everybody in society views men, especially white men as ""privileged scum pos"". because society views us as so privileged they actively ignore anything truly wrong with how society treats us and hates us for being so ""privileged"" when arguably women are more privileged imo, but even then the whole concept of ""privilege"" is silly. I never have ever called someone ""privileged"" and as a whole I dont think anybody is really truly ""privileged"" in society unless you're a filthy rich corrupted elite. 

Anyway, the only people who will care about you are other men. men are supposed to be the care giver and anything that they deal with they're just told to man up or whatever. you're expected to care for others when others arent expected to care for you. even then, most men wont care about you either. most men only care about women, either for relationship purposes or to try to get sex or whatever but really, go around saying ""I'm a man and depressed"" or ""my wife abused me"", and see how little anybody cares. 

ever since I made close friends with my ""bros"" I've felt so much happier since I always had girl-friends beforehand.

In a sub that discusses moral issues I posted my opinion about abortion. My post was more in the form of a question as I am still unsure about how I feel about abortion. I was immediately attacked by dozens of people and I was downvoted into oblivion. I do not mind being downvoted as long as the person who downvotes me also explains why they disagree with me. 

But many people kept telling me that since I am a man I am not allowed to have an opinion about what 'women do with their bodies'.

As always I was polite in my replies and I did not even react when insulted in the most vicious and personal way. They went so far as to say that a fetus is just a parasite.

To my surprise a day later I was banned from the sub but I received a message from the moderators telling me that I had to apologise for being a bigot and for trolling. I decided to humour them and I apologised. They kept asking me to apologise again. Eventually they told me to send them no more messages.

What is so shocking is that it has become acceptable for men to be denied from expressing their opinion, let alone having a say in any action that involves women.

1821,MensRights,"I am currently writing a masters thesis on impulsivity and emotional regulation, a process underlying practically all mental illness, and I believe there are some important parallels to be drawn between these processes and the current climate of proposed female vulnerability that I think is worth sharing. 

It is first important to understand that we are machines constantly recognising environmental cues. These cues e.g. the sound of running water or the smell of a fast-food joint guide us toward beneficial resources such as food and water. Furthermore, cues such as the howl of a wolf guide us away from potential threats. Our dopaminergic reward system plays a really important role in regulating our behaviour directed toward these cues. Take the example of smelling the fast-food joint; the irresistible familiar smell guides you through the door and drives to purchase the divine greasy treat. Subconsciously, your brain has observed a cue and predicted a reward based on your previous behaviour toward the cue. Due to your brain’s correct prediction of the reward it releases a large amount of dopamine to help you remember your response (buying the burger) is a beneficial reaction to the cue. On the flipside, not buying a burger is likely to make you a bit sad as your brain incorrectly predicted the response to the cue and less dopamine than expected is released. 

Impulsive disorders such as OCD, substance, and behavioural addictions all stem from maladaptive responses to cues. In other words, a cue may have a much more substantial effect on cognition than it deserves. You can think of this as the snap of an opening can of lager to an alcoholic; an otherwise normal cue that is now tied to intense craving of alcohol. 

What has this got to do with women and their perception of safety? Well, being the plastic malleable creatures we are, our response to environmental cues can be learned from others. Most of us know to steer clear of a rattle snake without having any prior experience of its bite. This is the issue.

The continuous conversation about female safety has taught many young women to recognise men as a cue (especially in the presence of other cues such as the time of day) that something horrible will happen to them. This leads to maladaptive responses to the cue such as crossing the road, calling a friend, or getting in a taxi that results in… you guessed it – Nothing. The fact that nothing happens results in a nice dose of dopamine reaffirming their response to the cue no matter how unnecessary it was.

Why is this a problem? Men are unfairly being associated with horrible people and are being mass generalised as such. This is damaging not only for men but for the women who are conditioned into thinking that any man is after them. The only way we can counter this is through education. In a twist of narrative, I believe it is now time not to have a conversation with your son about how to make women feel safe but to educate feminists and others (men and women alike) who perpetuate a notion of constant murder and abuse toward women. It was never men telling women to be vigilant, dress a certain way or avoid the streets at night, that fearmongering came from within the feminist community that constantly reduces women to nothing more than perpetual victims.",1615565312

It seems that people have gotten sick of the ""not all men"" responses that inevitably show up when women's issues are being discussed, due to the inevitable ""all men are dangerous"" type of language that tends to be used when sexual harrassment and rape are being discussed.

In order to avoid that, they've shifted to saying ""too many women"", as in too many women have been harrassed, assaulted, and raped. Too many women face these problems on a regular basis for the problem to be ignored, too many women get harrassed on a regular basis to stay silent about it.

At first glance it seems to be a great idea, it addresses the real and serious problems that women face without condemning every man for it, and should help the discussions not devolve into the usual men vs women arguments.",1615535675

Some quotes:

""Boys are more likely than girls to die in their second decade of life ... But even more troubling, Blum’s team [found](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X1930062X) that boys suffered higher levels of physical violence, neglect and sexual abuse by adults than girls.""

""In [one study](http://unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV365-Gewirtz-Meydan%20and%20Finkelhor%202019.pdf) of 13,000 children age 17 and younger, three-quarters of the boys who reported being sexually victimized said the person who violated them was another child. ***In a little more than half those assaults, the violator was a girl.""***

""The overwhelming majority of male rape victims say that the person who violated them was another male, but ***most male victims of other kinds of sexual violence say they were violated by a female.***""

""When we convey to boys that unwanted touch is a serious issue of sexual assault only when it affects girls and not when it affects boys, we are sending a message that only girls’ bodies are worthy of protection.""

""As the trial approached, lawyers representing the school board asked the judge to prohibit Martin’s legal team from using certain terms in front of a jury: rape, aggravated rape, sexual battery, sexual assault.""

Finally a real gem:

""Lara Stemple ... told me that her efforts to bring attention to male victims — and to the surprisingly high rates of female perpetration of such violence — have at times triggered false accusations that she is aligned with men’s rights activists, who are known for anti-feminist and misogynistic language and ideology.""

Even in an article about sexual violence against boys, MRAs are ""misogynists"". God forbid aligning with them. That's the Washington Post to you.",1615532162

1889,MensRights,"I think it would be more accurate to say men AND women are responsible for shaping social norms. Of course, they're also subject to social norms, which will affect their role in shaping them.

In times of societal change, you will always find those who struggle with the new societal demands. Here, it seems that society is trying to shift away from sexism. Consequently, we're seeing a lot of people struggling with change. Some object to this change and are frustrated to discover that rejecting emerging norms does not foreclose their effects. So I think we're seeing attitudes and behaviors reflecting this frustration.

Frustration is understandable. It's also confusing because the source is not always clear. I sympathize with frustration, but we can't lose sight of the real issue: Is it reasonable for women to want a less sexist society, and are women using reasonable means to pursue one? Those who disagree with the first question will not accept any answer to the second one.

And I think this is how social change always leaves some people behind. Those who simply cannot concede the reasonableness of pursuing social justice ultimately reject all methods of doing so. But this doesn't prevent changes from affecting them, so frustration naturally follows. And though I sympathize with frustration, that doesn't really change anything. Pursuit of a reasonable and necessary social goal justifies the frustration it inevitably creates. Would it really make sense to prioritize things the other way?",1615511728

This subreddit highlights a lot of big issues, but I think we need to start doing more. We should have a pinned thread dedicated to killing misinformation surrounding men, and link changes that need to be made to fix many of the issues men face today. 

For example, women can't be charged with rape in the UK, women who force men to have sex with them aren't legally rapists, family court issues, paternity allowances, the lack of support for male domestic violence victims, the lack of funding towards suicide prevention for men, the high rates of suicide amongst men, amongst many other issues. We need to combat the hate speech against men, on whatever platform you see it on, and the best way we can do that is with facts and statistics highlighting the issues, and pointing out flaws in the arguments used to support the hate speech that is being said. I highly doubt governments will talk about this evident issue, so I think its important that we work to fix it ourselves.

Here is the translation:

Kamaraj says he was supposed to deliver \*\*the food at 4:30PM\*\*. But \*\*he was 15 minutes late\*\*. The lady was already waiting at her door when he went to deliver. She took the food and placed it inside, on the table, \*\*just a feet away from the main door\*\*. 

She asks him to wait while she talks to the customer care. At this point, Kamaraj was worried and \*\*requests her not raise a complaint\*\*. In a rude manner, she refuses to pay the money and asks him to leave. \*\*He asks the lady to pay-up\*\*. Kamaraj then tells the lady to be polite and not to treat him like a slave. In reply, the lady acknowledges the delivery boy saying that \*\*he is indeed a slave\*\*. 

Kamaraj then takes the food and starts walking. Meanwhile, the \*\*lady grabs slippers and starts following him, then begins hitting him to snatch the food\*\*. To protect himself the boy pushes her hand. As a result her finger ring cuts her nose.

At the police station, the lady threatens him with names of big people. She swears that he will not allow him to escape. 

In the Video, Kamaraj can be seen crying and swears on his dead father that he is innocent. He says he is the only bread earner in the family. Roopesh Rajanna, a well wisher of Kamaraj proceeds to say that he has not eaten since the fateful day. Roopesh says He is poor and wants to die. He assures he will support Kamaraj.",1615611610

Upon removal of this variable, we see a marginally statistically significant trend suggesting that men are more likely to engage in behaviors of sexual harassment and assault as compared to women (27% of men vs. 21% of women, p=0.051).  

It's interesting that they try to also cherry-pick out the ""sexist comments"" part so that they could twist the numbers against men. However, even with their cherrypicking, they acknowledge a p-value of 0.051, which, as anyone who has ever taken a stats course could tell you, means that the difference is not statistically significant with a standard significance level of 0.05. So in the end, they failed to find that harassment and assault is a gendered offense in terms of perpetration. 

I have a feeling that this little hidden nugget of information won't be featured in any media articles or stopstreetharassment.org articles anytime soon.",1615599336

1971,MensRights,"Today I decided, as one of the complaints of us MRA's is a lack of shelters for men, to lodge a Freedom of Information request with the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government. 

The aim of this is to see if there is a disparity in funding using information readily available on the proportion of men to women living on the streets and creating a mean cost per man and woman on the street to decide if there is an existent disparity between funding provided for both. 

This is short as I have just lodged the request however, we will be able to answer the question in, at most, 20 days time.",1615596063

1974,MensRights,"That's a pretty tame headline in reference to multiple rapes of a minor.  It's even pretty tame for the crimes she was actually convicted of.   First-degree sexual assault sounds a lot more serious than just the generic sexual abuse.

1979,MensRights,"I’m seeing on all the major newspapers, the BBC, SKY news, the guardian etc, as well as Instagram posts getting a hundreds of thousands of likes.

How is this possible? 97% would mean 97 out of every hundred women you meet has been sexually harassed, which is without a doubt absolute bullshit.

Even in the least developed countries it would not be 97%.

It seems to be intentionally exaggerated figured to present men as a distant, fiendish and out of control specie.",1615589828

1982,MensRights,"But I wanted to say I am a huge supporter of this sub, and of men's rights. I ended up in a heated debate on Twitter with some so-called ""feminists"" today because of the recent murder in the UK and it solidified even more within me that men get such a bad rap for things that women are just as capable of. Their responses were absolutely diabolical, and when I pointed out the 84% rise in female paedophilia and examples of where women have been allowed to get away with things such as assault (18 times with no jail time),  they had no response other than, ""But look how they treat us"" I won't tell you what my response to that was, but it wasn't nice. 

I've seen the damage women do to men, firsthand. Please know that there are women out there that see the raw deals you get, and we support you.",1615588842
1983,MensRights,Im trying to do some research due to the sudden surge of instagram attention on sexual harassment and i realised i have no idea where to look.

1984,MensRights,"This is just new theory I've been thinking upon and wanted to get some feed back. While we do have our extreme sexist people on both end of the spectrum, my focus is on the people in the middle of the bell curve. Most people in this group, are they really sexist or are they selfish. If their gender were all of a sudden changed would they still believing in the same things as they did before or would they switch sides to whatever that would serve their needs &amp; be most beneficial to them. 

I started thinking more about this since I've been seeing the #Notallmen tag 

And I'm a guy who had been harassed by females before but didn't really speak up on it because men just shrug it off. 

Quite recently I invited a girl over &amp; she wanted to have sex. I was into her but didn't feel like having sex so I made sure I was drunk that it was whiskey D. She kept trying to push us to have sex the entire night and ran around flashing on me &amp; doing things to provoke me. I kept thinking that this is weird. Switch roles I'd be in trouble. She apologized to me the next day.

The moral of the situations that I've been in &amp; #Notallmen is that - this is more of a power dynamic. If women had the power they'd be doing the same &amp; I've experienced this first hand. I'm not submissive guy at all but I've been groped on first dates, hit on my face on first dates (in a flirty manner but I don't like it), pressured for intercourse. If women had more power and physical prowess we would see more of this across the board. Which kind of brings back to my main point that this is more of a power dynamic to the vast majority of people &amp; individuals being selfish. Open to thoughts.",1615588598
