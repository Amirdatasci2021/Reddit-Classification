0,MensRights,"&gt;&gt;Spinning Men's Issues as Misogyny
&gt;
&gt;Otherwise known as trickle down equality.

Sincerely, do you think it is possible for men and women to work together cooperatively on issues like this? How would you prefer women allies to approach these topics? I'm afraid I've come across like this while trying to demonstrate commonality.

An example might be a men's group advocating against risky/dangerous work bias, while a women's group advocates against infantilisation bias. Can they be allies? What would help?",1615948744

3,MensRights,"Hello there! First of all, I appreciate you asking questions instead of attacking me right off the bat. Second of all, I've had a very long day so I'll do my best to be thorough right now but please forgive me if I make a mistake or misunderstand your questions. 

1) When I say I am a feminist, I mean that I stand behind fighting for womens rights around the world. Especially those who can not speak out for themselves; not necessarily just the injustices we see here in the US. I **do not** stand behind any organizations that put female interests *ahead* of men's rights and that is never my intention so if I unintentionally say something that aligns with those views, please correct me and I will apologize. Like I said in my original post, I don't just call for equal rights when it is convenient. I truly want *equal* rights. 

2) The two women's issues that hold a special place in my personal life are reproductive rights (already progressed a lot here in the US this last decade or so but still a ways to go) and workplace discrimination. Around the world women and girls face challenges such as freedom to travel independently, freedom to dress as they want, the right to vote, freedom to choose their spouse, and forced genital mutilation amongst many many more.

3) Honestly I really know nothing about her so I can't say much. 

4) Of course! I love hearing statistics! It's probably one of the best ways to get a truly objective understanding on a specific topic (as long as it's from a creditable source)",1615948526

Then point out that the wife of the man who did it was arrested as well for trying to help him. Ask them ""I wonder if the poor girl might have survived if his wife did the decent thing?""

15,MensRights,"&gt; HOLY SHIT. WHY DIDN’T I THINK OF THAT BEFORE?!? In fact, why didn’t the millions of incels in world realize this? Tell me, since you’re an expert on this topic, should I “take a shower” as well? 

Honestly yeah, a shower wouldn't hurt. 

&gt; My point is that men with high paying, stable jobs, tons of investment assets and no debt are still facing a WAY more difficult dating market than an even an average, plain, boring woman. 

That's because any woman can raise their hand in a crowded bar, yell ""who wants to go home with me"" and probably 5 guys at least will raise their hands back at her, most likely more if she's attractive. Men typically have to work harder to get laid yea. So what? You see throughout the animal kingdom that the males are usually the colorful animals that have to do the mating dance to attract the female. I don't hear them bitching. It is what it is man, this whole sexual marketplace power imbalance isn't unique to humans. You're either gonna have to get over it and adapt to it or get used to living a sexless life. 

&gt; If you’re going to argue in bad faith, then it is literally a waste of my time to talk to you. And if you aren’t willing to believe the things I say about MY OWN LIFE, then you are wasting your own time talking to me. Going back and forth saying “You’re a misogynist!” “No I’m not!” “Yes you are!” Is going to get us nowhere. 

I wasn't arguing, just pointing out that the points being made were from a place of bitterness and did not at all contribute to the men's rights movement. If you want to trivialize the movement and make it all about how some incels are sad they aren't getting action, then we will never in a million years be taken seriously by anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Come on dude: Fix society, work on self improvement. If you want specifics that’s another discussion entirely but I’d be more than happy to give you a quick rundown. 

Actually yes I'm curious about specific solutions other than the ones we agree on ie. better yourself and whatnot, because I'm unsure that there are actually any realistic solutions that don't involve changing society as we know it. It will always be easier to change what you don't like about yourself than to change society. So if you don't like the fact that you're not getting laid, can we at least agree that it would be easier to add to your sexual marketplace value than to change the entire sexual marketplace as a whole?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; No. That’s like saying “Oh you don’t like being in prison? Why don’t you just start your own jail so you can be the one enslaving others instead of them enslaving you?” 

Not at all actually. I fail to see the parallel line drawn between our discussion and this example. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; That’s idiotic if you think about it for more than 5 seconds. Sure, you won’t instantly drop dead if you don’t have sex. It will be an even longer, more painful death. Statistics have PROVEN that sexless people die earlier. Contract more diseases and deal with more medical conditions. And of course: greater risk of suicide. It’s so fucking stupid that I actually need to explain this. If I said that cigarettes will kill you, you wouldn’t bat an eye. But if I say that lack of sex will kill you (in fact, it’s worse for you than cigarettes) then you freak. the fuck. out. Whatever dude, just admit that you were wrong about this scientific fact and I’ll stop embarrassing you. 

Site your sources my man, then we can get serious. What are these diseases? Is the correlation the causation when it comes to lack of sex? Abstinent people cant contract STDs so what else are they getting? Are these studies peer reviewed? What were the controlling factors and the lifestyle habits of the participants? I do believe that people could get depressed by lack of puss, god knows I would be, but a lot of other factors need to be taken into account as well. Also, where have you embarrassed me thus far?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Sticks and stones will break my bones, but nothing you can say will ever change the facts. 

A fact is defined as a thing that is known or proved to be true. Where have you proved any of the claims you have made?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I will not be shamed into silence. Cancel culture simply does not work on me, never will. Sorry for being curt, I’m just sick and tired of brain-dead vegetables like you trying to bullshit me. 

I would be salty too if someone I believed to be a ""brain-dead vegetable"" was getting more pussy than me. ;)",1615947351

You find them that would and men are experiencing and perpetrating abuse in equal degrees.

Women are more likely to get hurt though. But there is also some info cited on this sub where women are much more likely to initiate abuse and not have it reciprocated.

A women's advocate would prefer to look at police reports and death rates. That's where they get to ignore the men.

One finer detail  is that while intimate partner murders are generally 1 to 3 men to women, murders in family violence are near equal at 40% men.

No. That’s like saying “Oh you don’t like being in prison? Why don’t you just start your own jail so you can be the one enslaving others instead of them enslaving you?”

Yes I have been stung. I had multiple wasps up my back as a kid. I've also been stung by something in my lip, god knows what it was but it was the strangest sensation I've ever felt and this thing flew away and I'll never know what it was. It will forever remain a mystery bug.

Are you suggesting that women avoid men altogether? 

Facts about bees and wasps. Bees are more friendly, they'll very rarely sting you, unless they feel threatened. They die after they sting. Their life is done. Humans wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for bees, wasps on the other hand, I will have no problem knocking one out if it enters my space. 

You could define men like this. Picture the majority of men like bees, most of them are great, friendly, they buzz about doing their own thing, they like flowers, great smells, lovely sights and just mind their own business. Picture the minority of men who do commit sexual acts against women like an attacking wasp. This wasp just wants to get you, and he'll come at you from all angles to get you. These wasps (men) I don't like, I don't approve of them, I don't agree with them and I think they should pay for what they do. 

Me as a friendly bee doesn't like to be mistaken for an angry wasp and doesn't appreciate it when people start attacking me through their own fear of them thinking I'm going to start attacking them for no reason. Usually these people panic, over exaggerate, make crazy motions emotionally, cause a huge scene and blow things up over me just being a peaceful bee. Me and my other peaceful bee friends are just trying to be bee's yet people just want to attack who we are thinking we're all bad when it's a fact we're not. If we're to sting a woman we'd die. It is a deplorable act and we don't agree with this. We don't want to hurt women and we don't want to die. We want to chill, buzz around them for a bit, rest softly on their shoulders gently, have a picnic with them in a meadow.

176,MensRights,"So a woman you dated can go to court and lie about you because shes angry, say you stalked her, say you're dangerous and a threat and since 95+% of restraining orders are passed regardless of their merit(and women know this), you lose your god given right to protect you and your family. Bear in mind, the accused never harmed, threatened or assaulted anyone. I know this because it happened to me, a woman I broke up with and hadn't spoken to in 3 years, I messaged her after I broke up with my current gf and because she was still mad about old drama decided to punish me with a false restraining order. It's called restraining order abuse. This bill does nothing but disarm people. I've never committed a crime in my entire life, never even had a speeding ticket. I've never raised my voice to a woman, I've never stalked or hit a woman. The aforementioned woman was however abusive to me, physically and verbally as have several woman I've dated been. It was obviously a mistake messaging her but I didnt deserve what happened to me. This does nothing but give women even more privilege and power in the family court system but this time their abuses aren't limited to actual family. I spent $3,000 and endured psychological abuse trying to stop my abuser only to unjustly lose, but it wasnt so bad because I still had my gun rights. Now you want to take away my ability to defend myself and my children? What if someone breaks into our house while we are home? Guns should only be taken away from people who are actually aggresively violent, who have caused physical harm and not in self defense. I know I'm not the only one. There are millions of silent men like me. Restraining orders dont work, the best thing for a woman to do to defend herself is to become proficient with a firearm and carry daily. A piece of paper will not protect you from an abuser, who likely has nothing to lose anyway and you should take responsibility for your own protection, not put it into the hands of strangers. Did you know it's common for the woman's defense attorney to press for a domestic violence protection order at the beginning of a divorce in order to stack the bargaining chips in their favor?

#&gt;Rent is NOT FREE, you're  obligated to be helpful around the house! It's not YOUR house, so you pay rent indirectly. One of those ways is cleaning it and cooking food!
#&gt;Husband's MONEY goes to the Wife, he doesn't keep it all for himself!!  So that's already something that the wife is claiming that's not hers.

So let's recap, the Woman lives RENT FREE and uses Hubby's Credit Card and it's the Husband that owes her money!?? Uhhh, what!?

&gt;Ask most mothers who live in cities in India 

BOO HOO! Mrs Upper Caste Indian Feminust has it so Hard. Meanwhile, poor Indian women walk bare foot to collect firewood&amp;water EVERYDAY. You don't represent the 80% of rural Indians, you represent the concerns of urban upper class Indians.  Most rural indians don't even divorce, they stay married and if anyone deserves alimony it's the village women not the upper class rich Feminist.


&gt;the emotional needs of kids will become neglected

What rubbish! Boys need Father Figures, otherwise boys will end up as Overly Feminised Simps.  You can't reduce the father's role to an inhuman ATM in the family, he's a human and he doesn't need to waste all his energy on an anti-family Career. Both parents can do jobs that give lots of free time to spend at home, thus the chores are EQUALLY split and the boy gets to spend time with his primary male role model.

In case you miss my point AGAIN, who owns the house is not a trivial detail. Rent is NOT FREE, if you're gonna treat family like it's a ""business partnership* then I'm going to account for the **UNPAID RENT.** Since no rent is paid, i'm going to deduct it via Housework. Therefore, Alimony is COMPLETELY unwarranted.",1615950473

Holy cow. I never realized some people think this.

It used to be the other way round, historically, because of menstruation. In many societies men were banned to bathe in the same pools women used because women were considered unclean.

Even today, I wonder what argument can be made to consider men less clean than women because women menstruate while men don't, hence men don't need all kinds of pads and tampons to stay clean, but also because women spray urine differently than men who urinate with a clean, narrow stream that can be directed straight into the drain. It is really dubious that anybody can make a nature-based argument. Hygiene habits, on the other hand, very by person not by gender. Most men are very clean as far as I know and I am one.",1615950138

Google. If you aren’t willing to pull up a study that shows I’m wrong, then I highly doubt you’d put in the effort to read anything I sent you. Still, [let me go ahead and Google that for you](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=sexlessness+and+life+expectancy+).

&gt;You see throughout the animal kingdom that the males are usually the colorful animals that have to do the mating dance to attract the female. I don't hear them bitching.

Animals also sleep outside and walk around naked. If you want to live like an animal, be my guest. You’re trying to appeal to the idea that what is “natural” is automatically an unchangeable part of our experience. It’s exactly the same idea racists use when trying to defend segregation. Who cares if racism is natural? Who cares if it would be hard to change? Don’t you think it’s worth at least *trying* to end racism? Good. Because racism is a huge factor in what makes men incels. Everyone wants a mixed-race president, but no one wants a mixed-race boyfriend. In truth, 80% of men are incel or incel-lite. 

&gt; Actually yes I'm curious about specific solutions other than the ones we agree on 

Long story short: we need to stop the hypersexualization of society. This world is a sexual anarchy, where women fuck as many guys as they can fit in their mouth, children are being sexualized, there is on average 1 mass shooting per day, 75% of men admit to watching porn while at work, sluts are forming open relationships so they can fuck strangers (which statistically leads to lower self-reported relationship satisfaction), this world is fucking batshit insane. If the world thinks my ideas are crazy, THEN GOOD. This entire world is crazy. 

We need slut shaming. We need to stop allowing one gender all of the power. Justice is impossible when men and women are held to the same sexual standard, but nature only favors women. It’s not a sign of maturity or enlightenment to fuck 27 guys before you get married. Also, resisting the urge to fuck anything that moves does not limit your freedom. On the contrary, freeing yourself from desire and having a good marriage will ultimately lead to MORE freedom, not less. 

Also when I say this, retarded people think that I’m saying we should round up women in camps and force them to be sex slaves to undesirable men. No, Jesus Christ, why would you even think that? I’m just saying lay off the porn.",1615950003

The average length of shorts are about 11 inches meanwhile mini-skirts are on average 4 inches or even shorter.

Furthermore , you're just victim-blaming , couldn't you say the same about wearing trousers in the 50's?

Like do you seriously think women accepted other women who wear trousers?

Like I don't know why but this idea that discrimination of men is null if men discriminate against each other however even in this context women make fun of men too.

The reason why men don't wear skirts is because its not socially acceptable unless like in Ireland , its a different type of skirt , in addition , most men are hetrosexual , meaning if they want to get with women they have to be masculine.

However, I also don't believe the world is still strictly patriarchal. Gender roles are already comparatively fluid compared to 30 years ago.

Now the problem here is, when (extreme) feminists control their narrative, it's always ""We can do it too"" no matter the context. Worse still, this extreme side of feminism actually prohibits men from impeding on ""female territory"" -removing the possibility of men being a victim while simultaneously stressing that women are too weak to be the aggressor. Some have even gone as far as ""we can do it better"", but cry foul when they are presented the same amount of pressure that men have to deal with.

I guess my point is, although I'm a feminist, I'm very aware of the odd agenda of lowering standards with which women are compared against, while the standards for men are getting higher.

For men, the hard thing is to have lots of sex (because women won't just always say yes) so men who manage to have a sex with many women are praised.

* General reform around child custody and child support. I'd like to live in a world where a man (or a woman) can ask for custody, reliable get it, and then not be on the hook for child support. So long as they share custody equally, anyway (why should the man take on 50% off the parenting duties, but 75%+ of the financial responsibility? You should only pay child support if you refuse to be a parent).

* Divorce law reform -- a so-called ""default prenup"" that people could optionally opt-out of.

* Reproductive rights for men equivalent to what women already have

* Equal treatment under the law for sexual assault

* Equal treatment under the law for domestic violence

* I'm not sure what you'd pass for false allegations, but I think this is something that could be dealt with on a statutory level

* Education reform.  Better opportunities for men who want to go into higher education and ""male friendly"" environments for men in primary education, especially when it comes to teaching.

* More healthcare spending and research for men: address the life expectancy gap, and provide better insurance coverage for men who are expected to earn money for women at the expense of workplace benefits.

* More research into men's mental health.  Currently the industry focuses on women and tries to force men into treatments and paradigms that don't work for them.

* An end to routine infant genital mutilation

In addition I think some ""general"" (non gender based) reform would help:

* A shorter work week and better work environments.  We should try to put more women in the workforce working the same difficult jobs that men work. But if women ultimately refuse to take on that burden, we should make things better for men.  Basically, if men are going to be stuck slaving away to earn money for women who refuse to pull their own weight, we should work on things like better work-life balance and safer working environments.  Including earlier retirement dates for men who don't live as long because they've sacrificed their health earning enough money to keep their wife / girlfriend happy.

* Subsidized child care, especially under the age of 5.  There would be less need for one parent to ""stay home with the kids"" and force the other one into unreasonable labor expectations to make up the monetary difference.

* I'm sure we could do something about homelessness if we really wanted to.

355,MensRights,"I guess the most common would be sexual expression and/or sexual relationships? It just means that the opinions of people towards men who 'has game' is different from the opinons towards women who are 'too loose'. Or maybe the opinion that a woman in a certain workplace can climb the ladder faster because they 'slept with the boss' whila a man 'deserves it'. Note that even women hold that opinion to other women at times. And finally, the question of ""What was she wearing?"" and ""Maybe he was provoked by what she was wearing?"" when a woman is sexually harrassed. It's a nuanced(and I admit, shallow) point but it's a nod towards favouring male supremacy in society.

 But like I said. It's not inherently a patriarchal world anymore. Things have changed. But extreme feminists are pushing towards female supremacy(while holding on to the societal bias if it works for them) instead of finding a balance between the two sexes. Please don't attack those minor ""whataboutisms"" since they are only there for contrast. The point of my comment is that the narrative gets skewed when females say ""I am as strong as any man"" and ""I am not strong enough to overpower a man so he cannot be the victim"" in the same breath, in order to get a leg up in an argument.",1615971722

I mean, here are some choice quotes from TwoX about this:

&gt;Men don't care about women's issues. Men's only interest in women's issues is to derail the conversation, make it about themselves and perceive any discussion of male violence as a personal attack.

&gt;Not all men are actual rapists. Some are rape apologists. Some tell rape jokes. Some are victim blamers. Some are silent.

442,MensRights,"My point was classing every sexual act where alcohol was involved as rape is disengenous and false. If I had a single glass of wine and had sex, under their definition even if the entire act was consensual, it's rape. That's going to balloon the rape statistic massively (For your information, the same study did the same for men (But didn't count it as rape but as ""Made to penetrate"")). 

I wasn't talking about my own ideas about rape but criticising the CDC study which this statistic was found. There is nothing wrong with criticising studies. There are other criticisms with the CDC study aswel which I have not mentioned, but to answer your questions

&gt; So do you have to be completely blacked out before you consider it rape?

This is complicated. If both partners are both drinking, then it's consensual. If the man (or woman) purposely drugs or forces alcohol on the person with the intent to get them drunk and have sex then that's rape. If one partner drinks on purpose, then proceeds to have sex with someone else who is not drunk it's consensual.

Being drunk or having alcohol doesn't reduce your reasoning or rational thought to that of a child. Being drunk, you are still capable of making semi informed decisions. If I am drunk, and decide to have sex with someone it's consensual. There are times when I have drunk, been drunk, and had sex with my wife, I would call that consensual. It's the intent which matters. 

&gt; What about if a lady consented, then in the midst of the act, tells the man to stop, she doesn't want to continue and he doesn't stop. Would that be considered rape?

I have no idea what gave you the idea that I wouldn't think this is rape, rape is where consent is either not given, withdrawn or being unable to consent. Withdrawing consent is rape. 

&gt; Or what about a husband and wife, where the wife says no and the husband threatens or yells at her until she says yes. Would you consider that rape?

Your exact scenario yes, but I don't think cohesive attitude to get someone to agree to have sex is always rape. There is alot of nuance here and a fine line. If I ask for sex, my partner, she says no, then 5 minutes later she goes ""Oh well why not"" without further asking that's not rape. 

If I badger her constantly and she reluctantly says yes even though she doesn't want to, then yes that's rape. 

There is nuance here. If any form of cohesive attitude results in rape, if I ask for sex in the morning and my partner says no, does that mean any sexual acts at any time throughout the day is rape? There is a line where the cohesion is edging towards rape.",1615979153

Fathers are legally obligated to take care of their wives and children too.

I never said women shouldn't perform house work. 

If a husband already gave a huge amount of money to wife before divorce it can be deducted from alimony

You are context dropping while using the difficulties of poor lower caste women as an argument. You quoting poor lower caste women is like feminists saying LOOK LOOK AT THE WOMAN WHOSE RECTUM WAS PIERCED OUT DURING RAPE AND THEIR FACES GET ACID ATTACKED! HoW DARE YOU FEEL SYMPATHY FOR MEN! While you argue for mens rights. And imagine a feminist repeatedly bringing up that argument when you talk of men's issues. And saying DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT RAPED AND TORTURED WOMEN! when you talk about discrimination men face. I think we can both agree that you thoroughly feel bad for women who get raped and I feel very bad for the hardships that poor women go through. To imply that because I am arguing for alimony, I somehow donot care about poor women, is extremely disingenuous and an argument made in bad faith.


Err...i never said fathers aren't important. I actually made an argument FOR 2 parent families in my comments. Saying mothers/primary care givers are important doesn't mean fathers are unnecessary or bad/not wonderful.

After a divorce, a woman no longer lives in the same house as the husband. Also, like you said, house rent is compensated through house work.

Just to note on the flip side I think there's a fear from men that women will break their hearts, manipulate them, cheat on them, take advantage of them, leave them when they're no longer of use, which inevitably prolongs this fearful state leading them not wanting to get involved. I think the majority of both sexes overall suffer quite a bit because of these fears, ideologies and even dogma in some cases of what the other potential partner could possibly do, even though statistically the odds of this are proven to be pretty low? It's like the femme fatale thing for men....double edged sword.

I think that was this person's point. Just as, if he was completely drunk, a man wouldn't see a problem going into a seriously screwed-up part his the town wearing his whole rolex collection. That's alcohol-induced stupidity, and it leaves you at risk.


Drinking screws up with your judgement, so it should only be done in safe environments. Of course, nobody really does that, thanks to club culture, etc. Being drunk yourself put you considerably more at risk than the average person; being unable to defend yourself + poor judgement + reduced perception + being visibly weakened. 


It's the age-old problem, making it look like just because it's not directly YOUR fault, you shouldn't be careful or care about risk-reduction. The way this person was phrasing it is absolute nonsense, ""women should receive consequences for doing the wrong thing"" what the hell, particularly when said ""consequences can lead to murder, but this nonsensical sentence aside there's definitely a serious subject to be had about alcohol here, and not only on the perpetrator's side. Just because you're not at fault, it doesn't mean that it's smart to avoid any precaution, and being visibly drunk makes you an very easy target for the worst people out there.


Alcohol doesn't lead to nefarious activities, but it does lead to being a victim of those. Which is true for everyone. Saying that ""it's the other one that's at fault"" is a non-subject, since there will always be people like that, and, way more importantly, having someone to be condemned afterward will not fix the fact that your nove have been broken/you've been stabbed/ you've been raped.


So while the ""women should receive consequences for doing the wrong thing "" part is absolute nonsense, the ""if someone is going out and getting drunk, they are trying to get into trouble"" isn't.

It's no surprise that the prevailing narrative has been forcing people to look at the ""deaths per X white people"" vs. ""deaths per X black people"". And it's because it's the only statistics which would seem to indicate anti-black racism.

If you look at flat numbers, far more white people are killed by the police each year than black people. So they account for relative population size. But then like you pointed out, if you also account for relative number of police encounters, black people are actually killed by the police *less often* than white people.

&gt;**Conclusion**  
&gt;  
&gt;Limitations notwithstanding, the current study adds to the literature by using a national sample of adults in the United States and demonstrates that the majority of individuals adhere to rape myths in some form. **To the extent that these myths are believed, the rate at which male victims of sexual violence both report their victimization to law enforcement and receive treatment for it will remain low, and this population will remain hidden, creating a positive feedback loop that reaffirms these myths in the public sphere**. As these results indicate that the constructs that support male rape myths are similar to female rape myths, more needs to be done to **counter these belief systems and the stereotypes** surrounding rape and sexual assault, **regardless of the gender of the victim and offender**, given the significant impact sexual violence has on both the victim and the community at large.",1615991977

I can't read it or the papers it references, so I can't go into details, but it doesn't mention the rate of proven true accusations either, it lumps it in with equivocal cases and admits it can't actually say what the false accusation rate is in the final sentence of the abstract. There is also pressure on police departments to not investigate accusations to the point where they can be proven false because of pressure from feminists who think revealing the rate of false accusation would make women less likely to report true cases. That may be true, but men still deserve justice for the false accusations that do occur, and deserve the right to be protected from false accusations through punishing false accusers.

The birth certificate is irrelevant. A person is more than a piece of paper written out at birth. How far is too far when you're talking about letting someone live their life how they wish without some wanker denying your identity because he doesn't agree with how you wish to identify.

&gt;Yes that would be a problem, considering I was born a ""him"", that's the sex on my birth certificate. That's scientifically and biologically what I am. So your comparison is flawed.

I'll take a 'yes that would be a problem'. What you are is irrelevant to the hypothetical. You understand that emotional abuse is a problem. Well done.

&gt;I am also racially an Indian, by birth of course. Imagine if I felt more like an Asian or African?

Now I may not be visibly Black, I'm certainly not by descent, but I identify as an African-American, do I have the right to apply for that scholarship?

If you had an established medical precedent sure. But race is very different from gender because it's not a scientific concept. Genetically, races are barely different from eachother. Gender however is governed by an entire chromosome. Put simply, your body doesn't really care what 'race' it is because it's genetically irrelevant. But it will most definitely know if there's a chromosomal mismatch.

If it was about equality then why does it only target things that benefit women, why havent I seen the Selective Service issue brought up? I wish people had more critical thinking skills. So if anyone at all ever made the statement that it's about equality or for the betterment of men they would shut it down right then and there. Its obviously not. There shouldnt be debate.

While im here. I'm limited to a couple interactions on reddit per day. There needs to be a better movement. Please do that. Feminism has infected the world. The entire world. Greatly. Do you see how powerful it is? Do you see how privileged women are for it? Do you see all of the things it has done? Where is that for men? Its wherever all the actual MRAs decide to congregate and do something. There have been more female voters than male voters in every election since the 1950/60's.

729,MensRights,"If you are going to quote selectively, at least quote the conclusion instead of the abstract.

&gt; In summary, any successful approach to controlling weight needs to take a wider and longer-term approach than studying the intake of calories. There is evidence of physiological mechanisms that monitor intake, although Western society often ensures that they are overwhelmed and obesity develops. However, although these control mechanisms are powerful, understanding how they function may be helpful. Rather than simply reducing calories, understanding the influence of the food consumed on satiety, satiation, and energy compensation may be advantageous.

&gt; It is, however, overly optimistic to expect a simple solution to such a complex and multifaceted problem. Given that the body actively attempts to maintain its existing body weight, we need to learn how to outflank such mechanisms. A first step will be to get beyond simply trying to reduce caloric intake.",1616874350

749,MensRights,"Adding to the apex fallacy is the survivors fallacy. CEOs aren’t necessarily the best, but they are the survivors of decades or work. 100s of men’s and women were competing to get to that position. They either gave up, moved on, or stayed in place. The CEO is the lone survivor of all those people fighting to the top. It’s not because he was smarter, or worked harder, or is a man, but that he survived his way to the top. Feminists would like you to believe that it just takes hard work to get to the top, and since women work as hard as men, it must be sexism preventing them from getting to the top. Sure, hard work is part of it, but if that’s all it was everyone would be a CEO. The truth is it takes survival, and in the rat race men happen to be better survivors. That’s not because men are better, a lot of times it’s because men are more desperate. Perhaps if there were less social programs supporting women, less men willing to marry a lower earning wife, and more value placed on what a woman earns instead of how she looks, women would be as desperate to succeed in the corporate world as men are, and we would see more gender parity at the top. But that’s not the world we live in, and that’s not the world feminists are fighting for. If anything feminists are making that worse, not better. Sure, they are opening up more corporate avenues to success, but at the expense of every other non-corporate paths to a successful life.",1616873363

Yet when this idea gets challenged, we have studies (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691617690878
) say something entirely different:

&gt;After dieting, in a randomized trial for 6 months, either a high-protein or control diet was consumed. Satiety was higher and less weight was regained when high-protein meals had been consumed (Lejeune, Kovacs, &amp; Westerterp-Plantenga, 2005). Similarly, a Cochrane review concluded that the overweight and obese lost more weight when on a low-glycemic-load diet; that is, they consumed a diet that produced smaller increases in the level of blood glucose. It was, however, noted that there was a need for longer term follow-up studies to establish a long-term benefit (Thomas, Elliott, &amp; Baur, 2007).

&gt;In another study overweight adults lost 10% to 15% of their weight when they followed a low-carbohydrate, low-fat, or low-glycemic-index diet (Ebbeling et al., 2012). **The fall in resting energy expenditure was, however, largest after the low-fat diet**: an important observation as this would encourage energy compensation and the regaining of lost weight. In another study, subjects were monitored for 7 days while consuming covertly manipulated diets (Stubbs, Harbon, Murgatroyd, &amp; Prentice, 1995). After a delay of 3 to 4 days a greater intake of carbohydrate or protein, but not fat, was part of a negative feedback loop that reduced subsequent energy intake.

Emphasis on low fat. What again is the thing that got so hyped somewhere along the late 90s to even today? That's right: high fat bad, low fat good. Surely, you have heard of ketones? Let's stick with double blind studies before making bold statements that don't hold water, ok m8?

How funny for them to say that justice itself somehow holds the length of her skirt against a victim when, if there's a ""rape culture"" (which is defined as a society that ignores, downplay  and normalize rape; of course sentencing something is normalizing it.. don't bother), it is in fact towards men raped by women (not other men, these ones are more or less recognized). Nice role reversal here.


The kind of people saying this are just narcissistic that are so unable to understand what everyone else is going through that they immediatly think that anything that happens (or don't even happen, in the case of the skirt) is an attack towards either them or their ""labels"".

804,MensRights,"Some people, and for society I think a critical mass, are very genitally focussed. Thinking about sex, usually in its most base forms, takes up most of their thinking and so personality. This is true for men and women, but women seem often to dislike being seen in a base sexual way whilst enjoying seeing others that way. Whilst I find such sociatally encouraged hypersexualised sorts to be as disappointing in character as cocaine users, I do pity those women who want to act out in this hypersexualised manner but fight to be seen as more interesting and less sexualised. This contradiction must make them quite unhappy.

I suggest you learn from these people. Steer clear, but learn. Decide consciously how you will handle sex in your life and don't pump up your sex drive with society's preapproved lifestyle. Sex is fine, but it is hardly the most important part of your life or character. Even of your relationships with others.

Almost everything about you is more interesting and fulfilling than your cock. Sex, beyond children (which is a whole other minefield), is just a bit of fun rivaled by a good meal.

806,MensRights,"Well men bottle it up. I used to get hit for crying as a kid out of frustration off my dad. I've forgiven him for that and I don't think he was happy doing that but that's maybe how his dad taught/treated him. It's like a negative cycle or something that's passed down. Sometimes it's easier to physically shut something up than to try and understand it. That's like a brutally honest way of describing something like that. 

I've heard stories of bullies that bullied kids who went onto be World Champions in the UFC. Years later that champion has gone onto see his bully homeless and how years ago when GSP's (champion) dad went round to this bullies house to ask to ask his son to stop bullying GSP his dad beat the living 💩 out of his kid. GSP's bully was taught how to communicate with his fists. 

If you cry too it seems like you're not keeping it together. But it's more of not being able to suppress it any longer. 

Men can explode too because they bottle it all up. If I just naturally expressed how I feel you wouldn't like it put it that way, it's like spitting out a tornado. It can be easily misinterpreted as well cause maybe men struggle to make sense of their emotions? But if you picture it like soda in a bottle and if it's shaken shaken shaken there's a way to defuse the fizz and it can easily go everywhere if it's not done properly that's how I see it. 

I cried in front of my GF once because I was about to walk out on her. I looked over and she was smiling. I said ""look at you laughing you don't even care do you?"" I put her on the spot and I explained why I'd been doing all the things I'd be doing and expressed myself naturally. 2 minutes later she was in pieces, breaking her heart out on my chest crying saying ""she can't do this without me"" and later said she was laughing because she was scared, scared of me walking out. However she finished me a week later but men and women deal with their emotions differently, maybe it's a biological thing or a generational thing but it's not always easy for a man to make sense of his emotions never mind the people around him so he usually locks em up and you'll just see occasionally outbursts every now and then.

811,MensRights,"First thing you need to do to solve your 'issues' is stop believing in the feminist 'toxic masculinity' dogma...

The whole point of 'toxic masculinity' is to shift the responsibility of women's behavior towards men into the men themselves

Masculinity is not toxic; it's the feminist attitudes towards masculinity that are toxic.

It's the toxic feminist ideology that is trying to impose an unnatural and divisive anti male society that's at fault. A system of thought and invented discriminatory practices in feminist ideology, culture, and economy, that feminists call the patriarchy and toxic masculinity.

The term toxic masculinity is part of the feminist ideology that sees male behaviour within a context of the patriarchy and denies as much as possible that it is (1) the result of biological differences, and (2) that typical male behaviour is “human” behaviour.

Toxic masculinity isn't about masculinity at all; it's all about the negative stereotypes that all men are accused of, simply because they are men.

Men dont hide their emotions because of 'Toxic Masculinity'; They hide them because no one cares.

Well that's the problem. You take the time to call it Toxic Masculinity when ""sexism"" ""oppression"" and ""misandry"" are preexisting words that fit. But for some reason you don't want to use those words...

**Toxic masculinity was originally created by the mythopoetic men's movement, with a completely different definition. The mythopoets believed that society was forcing boys to be feminine, instead of letting them be themselves.**

Feminists twisted the definition  by demanding men be more feminine, and deciding that they know what's best for men. 
The feminist definition of toxic masculinity is a backlash against the growing number of men speaking up.",1616882001

The only way I feel like I can help is to listen to all sides of the issue and have conversations to try and help men and women understand each other better... but here goes.

I live in a small town with one industry. Women face a lot of abuse here and there are resources available, but it really bugs me that there is little for the men to turn to when they need help. What little resources are available, the men in the community may not feel comfortable admitting that they need help.  For example, a man loses his high paying laborious job and ends up at the bar trying to figure out how he will support his family. Wife leaves with the kids and he is now in more debt with a spiralling alcohol/drug addiction. It’s a common narrative which also leaves men in this area afraid to be vulnerable, or work to make a relationship happen. Because of this, women blame men for shitty cyclical behaviour and also leaves women afraid to be vulnerable as well. 

After typing this, it’s probably a more common narrative everywhere. It just really irritates me that the resources are minimal at best. I feel like all I can do as a woman is to just show up for those people that call on me for help, and I feel really thankful that I’ve been able to help my male friends through their depression. I also feel thankful that my male friends and I can have these conversations and they can take it back to their place of work for other men. I lurk because I care about both sides of the coin.

They must like sports and physical activity and constantly be looking for relationships and power. They must also show off that power to others to proove themselves. They must remain calm at all times except in some cases where they need to use their anger to protect those they care about (That's a grey area I personally don't understand) so the ideal goes.

With regards to your boyfriend that's good. I can only speak for me personally but I'd love actual support, someone to he there for me. Someone to listen and try and understand.

One of the things about feminism is that for a lot of women its a very convenient excuse to get ahead, and to have complete power. E.g power of selection politically established in feminism ('that guy I dont find attractive is being creepy by showing me interest"") for example. Women know that they have a lot of things better in life but they'll happily ignore those bits when fighting for their 'equality'. Now I'm not saying there is never a case for women's rights movements because some things women shouldn't have to deal with, but modern feminism is toxic and a lot of these women really aren't nice people.

984,MensRights,"That is exactly point of feminism. You have an idea that

1) feminist is a woman. Absolutely not true (e.g. the psychologist Honza Vojtko)

2) a woman driven by emotions
It makes us feel degraded to just nonrational beings who aren't capable of rational arguing.

And to point out some inequality in Czechia
- the recent affair when Blatný refused to allow Polish women to get an aborting in CZ, changed is view only after the public started complaining
- there is much less women in politics (22,5 % in parliament in 2019). Definitely not the 50:50 that we should aim for.
- Radim Uzel and his influence (""Touching women's ass is okay, helps with relationships in the working space."" ""Rape has always been here and always will."" Stereotypes like ""Men are aggressive, women should beware them."") His interview on DVTV is absolutely terrifying.
- doctors not allowing women to get sterilezed as ""They may change their mind"" (was discussed in the group I describe lower)
- body shaming, slut shaming, virgin shaming
- stereotypes of any kind

If you want to see my and Czech feminists perspective (not radical, no KMA here), you can check (pun not intended) out the group Everyday Patriarchy Bullshit on facebook. It should be public, joining isn't mandatory to see the posts. As the name suggests, it mainly shows everyday little things that are against equality. For non-czechs, let me describe some of the  recent posts

- *picture of dirty hands, from repairing a car or something* and the text ""If your man's hand never look like this, you're dating a girl."" (Notice: the point of posting this to this group is to mock the picture, so it's point is to ""fight"" against the stereotype ""men should be dirty, else they are not manly enough"")
- *picture of some coach in gym, women who bend themselves such that their genitals are exposed, he touches them ""to help""* and again joking text ""I'd looooove to have this job""
- pictures from language textbook promoting stereotypes
- the pic that was also popular on Reddit with Google translate assuming genders for neutral pronouns
- a discussion about the information that 90% of male r*pe is caused by another man (the OP is asking for resources for this. Resource-searching is kinda often in there)

This is where my journey of a feminist began, so that's why I'm recommending this to you. The group is very welcoming and supports debate, so if you want to pose some question there, it shouldn't be a problem. 

Personally, I believe that in Czechia, women aren't opressed systematically or something. There is a lot of sexism coming from older generation (e.g. our professor telling us that women should not study *my specialization*), but we're doing pretty okay.
Countries like India, Poland, Sudan and many more African/Asian countries need feminism desparately more.

I think more and men will get angry and point things out but it will take time for anyone to take it seriously such is the level of mainstream misandry.

I suggest you read the Overview section of Erin Pizzey's wikipedia page or one of her books.  She was the founder of Refuge, one of the two organizations in the UK that recently had their funding diverted to nondiscriminatory organizations after decades of sexism.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Pizzey

She created the worlds first domestic violence shelters.  After opening several for women in the UK, she suggested that men could be abused too and men needed a shelter too.  She was then slandered, her kids were threatened, her dog was killed, bricks were thrown through her windows, and she was removed from the DV organization she founded (now known as Refuge which has now lost funding decades later).  She fled the country for her childrens safety and became an outspoken DV activist and anti-feminist once they moved out on their own.




I wish we as a society look at gender neutral domestic violence data instead of studies looking for violence against women.

&gt; Almost 24% of all relationships had some violence, and half (49.7%) of those were reciprocally violent. In nonreciprocally violent relationships, women were the perpetrators in more than 70% of the cases.

Src: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1854883/

Behind a paywall I have archived around, but Harvard research that women are more likely than men in starting or escalating domestic violence and those women are by far the women most likely to be injured in DV. That doesn't say all women injured are perpetrators themselves, but it does indicate the problem goes beyond the feminist/pop culture model of ""violence against women"".

It includes:

&gt; Almost 25% of the people surveyed — 28% of women and 19% of men — said there was some violence in their relationship. Women admitted perpetrating more violence (25% versus 11%) as well as being victimized more by violence (19% versus 16%) than men did. According to both men and women, 50% of this violence was reciprocal, that is, involved both parties, and in those cases the woman was more likely to have been the first to strike.

https://thedailycounter.com/male-victims-of-domestic-violence-are-they-ignored/

Most domestic violence research today is research of ""violence against women"" from grants specifically looking for data on violence against women, not gender neutral research.

oncefa2 has posted lots stuff on this topic with academic references.  I think the best two for references are...

https://old.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/f604hw/some_sources_on_the_severity_of_domestic_violence/

and

This one is interesting because usually as soon as I point out that DV isn't gendered someone explains it is because more women are killed by their partners than men.  It wasn't always that way.  Women got better options and stopped killing as much.

https://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/e6hxvq/battered_husband_syndrome_as_an_explanation_for/

If the goal is to save women's lives rather than demonize men, it sure looks like we should be giving men better looking easily available options.  But the folks that run DV programs don't want that.

I also suggest you look into the feminist Duluth Model of Domestic Violence Intervention which results in men being beaten by their wives being arrested more often than the perpetrator when they call the police for help.

Ellen Pence (The creator) herself has written,

&gt; ""By determining that the need or desire for power was the motivating force behind battering, we created a conceptual framework that, in fact, did not fit the lived experience of many of the men and women we were working with. The DAIP staff [...] remained undaunted by the difference in our theory and the actual experiences of those we were working with [...] It was the cases themselves that created the chink in each of our theoretical suits of armor. Speaking for myself, I found that many of the men I interviewed did not seem to articulate a desire for power over their partner. Although I relentlessly took every opportunity to point out to men in the groups that they were so motivated and merely in denial, the fact that few men ever articulated such a desire went unnoticed by me and many of my coworkers. Eventually, we realized that we were finding what we had already predetermined to find.""",1616896671

1050,MensRights,"I grew up in a home where gender norms didn't exist. I raised by a single mom who was a 'tom boy"".

Crying has never been emasculating to me. It's just something that happens. 

Now that I'm in digital psychology and neuromarketing, with years of study in clinical psychology, I can honestly say the problem with men has never been a fear of feeling feminine. 

If such fear exists, then it's not the root cause and can't be fixed by telling them to stop. Just like telling a depressed person to stop being depressed won't help them either. 

It's the fear of negative emotions which is completely common between both genders. 

In every school of behavioral psychology, we learn that the core behavior that continues mental health disorders, like depression and anxiety, is the evasion of feeling negative emotions. 

The ability to heal a disorder is directly proportionate to the person's ability to confront painful thoughts and memories. 

It's not due to some nameless or cureless disease. The number of biological causes of depression and anxiety is few and far between. They can also be found with a common blood test. 

Since these two disorders are very common within the female gender, we can see it's a prevalent issue for them as well. 

What causes a lot of confusion is that there are two ways that mental health disorders can be expressed. 

There is a direct expression and an indirect expression. 

A direct expression is feeling insecure about your weight and forming an eating disorder. 

An indirect expression is feeling insecure about your weight and becoming a workaholic in order to achieve success and feel better about yourself. 

One is seen as a good quality because it can't be directly tied to the person's insecurity and the other can be directly identified as an effect of their insecurity. 

So men, to make up for their lack of comfort with negative emotions, tend to armor themselves by denying its existence. This causes them to become unfeeling and many times unknowingly depressed. 

Women don't necessarily deny its existence, but they avoid dealing with the issue. ""I don't want to talk about/think about it."" This doesn't deny the existence of depression, but they're unable to fully deal with it until their painful memories are dealt with. 

This a very watered-down version of the issue. It's far more complex than this. 

Self-alienation can cause layer, upon layer, upon layer, of direct or indirect expressions of mental disorders--even mixing them up.

Said this way, the 'fear of crying' affects both genders equally. They're just expressed differently most of the time. 

Both genders should be acknowledging the importance of facing painful emotions and being completely honest with themselves. 

It's very tiring to hear this being called a gender-specific issue.",1616894322

Those male friends need to be more careful. I always stay vigilant at night. I understand that women should be careful at night, it's better to be safe than sorry.

However, the facts show that men are more likely to be violently attacked or/and killed. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1635092/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1635092/). Most people, men included, do not think of this.

1092,MensRights,"Wtf do you think people can do about it except talking about it ? It's like the comment saying that ""you just have to make one, just get hired by Twitter and make the account"" like wtf ? Would you say the exact same if the gender were reversed ? I don't think so. You wouldn't have such a tirade about ""just be the change you want to do""

Like, why the UN would make an account for women and not for men ? You are not actually answering that because you know there is not an answer that wouldn't look bad. We couldn't care less about ""the guys who are behind the account"", nobody is talking about that so stop this shitty dogwhistle.

Now good job, at least now you know that yeah, people on Reddit complain about problems, now guess what, you don't know anybody here, you don't know if somebody is actually trying to make things change, and maybe if nothing is changing it could be because it's way harder than you think it is, especially with people like you who can't take this kind of issue seriously.

Like come on, were you seriously talking about equality on your first comment ? How tf having one account on female empowerment is ""about equality""? Oh yeah right because you are so into the feminist propaganda that you automatically associate feminism with ""equality"" even in cases were it's not, even when people try to tell you.
Honestly just explaining from A to Z why such a thing is just a symptom of men and women in society and how a lot of men like you have just a weird internalized sexism mechanic where they think women problems are serious and stuff but not men's would be just too long to explain but stop thinking that women are fragile ppl that need help and men's don't.

1130,MensRights,"This raises an important point that is often overlooked. Because of diversity, men and women will be on a spectrum of physical characteristics and consequently some will be dismissed from interaction because their characteristics do not match perceived desirable parameters. This may be considered reasonable choice and a perfectly natural situation, yet it means people are suffering through no fault of their own. We take steps to try to give people with a disability a better, more equal life, yet we ignore those with the disability of not matching desirability expectations.

Choosing to not interact with a man with a micro-penis is not body shaming but personal choice: criticising a man for a characteristic outside his control is body shaming. The same goes for women.

Having said that, personal choice is influenced by many factors: it is not something that is developed in isolation. Unfortunately, society pays little attention to managing those factors so that we don't influence people to be unnecessarily discriminatory: encouraging the twiggy look to be flavour of the month in terms of desirability is just a single example that is destructive. We also do nothing to facilitate those who are judged as less desirable to have a similar quality of life as the rest of the population.

It all seems to be very ""survival of the fittest"" orientated and not 21st Century progressive civilisation orientated and it breeds the contempt of ""F you Jack, I'm okay"".

In the case of micro-penis for example, we can point out that it doesn't prevent a man from being able to satisfy a woman, unless the only way for her to be satisfied is with only a large genuine penis (ever considered a dildo?) and a relationship usually consists of more than simply sex (for a woman at least). We don't want to generate pity, but the recognition of flexibility and options in the achievement of goals that are more inclusive and not less.

There has been far too much emphasis in society of only one way to skin a cat and anyone not using that single approach being unworthy of consideration.

Society needs to recognise that it's goal is to support all of its members to have the best quality of life that is practically achievable (also respecting the environment) not the deliberate creation of division between haves and have-nots

But if you ask feminists for examples of positive masculinity, they're stumped. They can't come up with any description of positive masculinity, because they can't imagine that one exists.

If you try to prompt them by suggesting some traits that are usually considered aspects of positive masculinity, such as stoicism, being protective of anyone weaker, emotional stability, self-sacrifice for their family etc, then feminists will handwave them away by saying, ""None of those are gendered. They're just positive attributes of people in general"".

Got that? Only negative traits are gendered, and they're always gendered male. Positive traits are either gendered female or are non-gendered.

1229,MensRights,"All men are equal. All humans are equal. The fact that life isn't fair, and the ability of individuals or clans (feminism is a clan for that matter) to gain control over others does not make any person superior by essence. 

We are now celebrating the Jewish Passover. This day commemorates how slaves became free people, under the leadership of a man who could not speak clearly, a person who sounded to most as mentally disabled. This is taken as a myth, but this captures and describes something which is always true - no men or women are superior or inferior by essence. They are only oppressed or free. The fact that feminism abused the term Oppressed to manipulate democratic societies that are built to be mobilized in support of the oppressed, because they were formed in a mass resistance to oppression circa 1848, does not mean oppression does not exist. More and more men in Westernized societies and beyond are currently living under oppression, systematic and state-operated. 

If those men, will be unable to see the feminist and progressivist abuse of the term Oppression and instead believe that the very concept of oppression is false, because out of a general political conviction they wish to believe that oppression never existed, they will never resist the systematic oppression, which would make them part of it. You must free yourself. 

You don't have to join ""male feminism"" for that. It's done internally, and the motivation for doing it comes from the very same source your rejection of the term Oppression comes from - you are born free, you are human. But you must acknowledge first that you live under oppression. You need to see your chains in order to break them. 

Acknowledging your oppression does not make you weak and it is never tantamount to an arbitrary acceptance of how feminism has abused this term. It likewise is not a contradiction to your self-reliance as a man and a human being, you are not blaming society for your own incompetence. This may happen, but you must try to distinguish between blaming society with self-victimization, which must be avoided, and seeing specific rights and freedoms that society systematically infringed you of. What determines your self-reliance is not whether or not you see your chains, but where your hands are when you see them, do you carry your shackle or shatter it.",1616913242

Why do you even need to debate this in any way at all, let alone in a civil way. 
   
Do you or do you not think men have the same rights as women? That just requires a yes or no answer, no debate required.

Feminism like this:

At the root of modern feminism is androcide.

- “Hatred of men is actually brave and courageous and we need to celebrate the women who are willing to openly display their hatred towards men.”  psychologist/feminist  Tracey Brimmer

- I feel that ‘man-hating’ is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them. *Robin Morgan, Ms. Magazine Editor*

- I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig. *Andrea Dworkin, feminist*

- Since marriage constitutes slavery for women, it is clear that the women’s movement must concentrate on attacking this institution. Freedom for women cannot be won without the abolition of marriage. *Sheila Cronin, the leader of the feminist organization NOW*

- Marriage as an institution developed from rape as a practice. *Andrea Dworkin*

- The institution of sexual intercourse is anti-feminist. *Ti-Grace Atkinson, feminist*

- Rape is nothing more or less than a **conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear.**  *Susan Brownmiller, Against Our Will p.6*

- The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race. *Sally Miller Gearhart, in The Future – If There Is One – Is Female*

- And if the professional rapist is to be separated from the average dominant heterosexual (male), it may be mainly a quantitative difference. *Susan Griffin, Rape: The All-American Crime*

- If life is to survive on this planet, there must be a decontamination of the Earth. I think this will be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males. *Mary Daly, Feminist*

- Men who are unjustly accused of rape can sometimes gain from the experience. *Catherine Comins, feminist*

- I believe that women have a capacity for understanding and compassion which man structurally does not have, does not have it because he cannot have it. He’s just incapable of it. *Barbara Jordan, former Congresswoman*

- Women have their faults / men have only two: / everything they say / everything they do. *Popular Feminist Graffiti*

So , why dont you start off the civil discussion you want to have by telling me in a civil way why I or any other man on this planet shouldn't demonise feminism, and everyone who choose to call themselves feminist, especially in r/mens rights.

“One of the reasons for the failure of feminism to dislodge deeply held perceptions of male and female behaviour was its insistence that women were victims, and men powerful patriarchs, which made a travesty of ordinary people's experience of the mutual interdependence of men and women.”

The moment we humans found surplus, some alphas started hoarding to protect themselves and their tribe against threats. This isn't or it shouldn't be as much needed nowadays as we humans are already very safe if we agreed on common rules. Still, it might be coded to our genes at this point to still hoard more until others have nothing left.

There are still ""alphas"" and ""betas"" but the difference is negligible really and it has become more about who has and who doesn't even if those roles wouldn't be needed. It's simply a relic from the past that has become a curse and it often ends up in great violence at some point.",1616912514

Why the apparent double standard? Simple- because the status quo overpenalizes individuals who happen to be male for engaging in male behavior. I strongly believe that sex criminals should be equally male and female because (heterosexual) sex itself requires both a male and female partner. Our society should strive to create a system where participation in an activity necessary for the continuation of life does not engender a greater risk of imprisonment for anyone because of their gender. Otherwise we are not receiving equal burden of law, nor equal protection of law as potential victims. But perhaps it is simply not possible to make gender neutral rape laws unless we grade on a curve.

Put differently, part of what makes the ex in this story a good candidate for penalization is the fact that this this accusation is beyond the pale coming from a male victim talking about a female alleged perpetrator. 999 out of 1,000 women will never be accused of doing anything like this\*.

When all men want is sex and women only want fun. The women have the power. Dating between 18 en 27 or so os absolute shit for men.

Women have had their sex, and want a man. That's when men take over and stay on top.

Women's sexual market value declines from their peak years. Men are valued differently, so we peak well after 30.

So it's not so black and white. If a man wants to cheat the game to maximize his benefits. He Chad's until bored and then picks a girl that would never have fucked with him before, but wants children and settle down.

Just like how women try to ride cock until 30 and expect a high value man to pop up at the right time.

Just look in one comment section of a true crime drama or even on this very subreddit I'm sure. And even if it doesn't happen today it has still happened in the past and lingers on people's minds. 

I explained my points clearly and politely. I never once insinuated that you were in the wrong, yet you chose to attack me. That is not the proper way to win an argument.

Women have a right to be scared of men. And men have a right to be scared of women. Women just don't get so uptight about it. I think the fact that the subreddit 'feminism' has less members than this one shows its not as big a problem as you think.

I will never knowingly group a people together and state they are all the same. That's simply not true. Everyone has their own thoughts and beliefs. I emolore you to do the same. Not every women trying earnestly to get their point across wants to degrade men. 

There are many men issues that need addressing. Single fathers being outcast, male nurses being mocked. Unfortunately however, a lot of angry people on the internet spend more time attacking the reladicals of what they perceive to be 'all feminists' (who are in fact, just like men who commit crimes against women, the minioity) than doing anything about it.

Please can you re read my arguments again after calming down. I know when people are upset it's easy to read things in a nasty or condescending tone.  I just want you to assess my point critically before giving in to your want to defend yourself. If 'not all men' is true, which it is, then you have nothing to defend against. There is no need to get defensive as you clearly did in the last sentance of your last comment.",1616923255
1337,MensRights,"&gt;Why are the expectations for men 'from women, primarily'?

Because women control sexual reproduction. A perfect example of this is

[https://historyoffeminism.com/category/the-white-feather-campaign/](https://historyoffeminism.com/category/the-white-feather-campaign/)

Note that this was before women got the vote and the leading suffragettes were involved in starting it. It shows that women always had social power and always used it to shame men into doing the dull, dirty and dangerous work by using the threat of reproductive exclusion.

Likewise, it was women that drove the prohibition movement in the 1920s

[https://vintagenewsdaily.com/the-kiss-of-prohibition-lips-that-touch-liquor/](https://vintagenewsdaily.com/the-kiss-of-prohibition-lips-that-touch-liquor/)

using the exact same mechanism, albeight this time even more explicitly.

&amp;#x200B;

The same dynamic is at work today, for example if a man speaks about

[his experience with a violent female partner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tTUREalxVQ)

or when women

[outright celebrate and glorify such violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrvDhSB7GHk)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;those in power are the ones that set the expectations for society, right?

Depends on how you define ""power"". As described above women have always had the social power to shame men into compliance by shaming them as being ""not real men"" and thus not eligable for reproduction.

This pattern is in active use today throughout the feminist movement to shut down men and gain the upper hand, for example:

[Australian Senator uses ""mansplaining"" to shame male politician](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQoV8UwLWSk)

Accusations such as ""male fragility"", ""male privilege"", ""muh historical oppression"" etc pp are direct decendants of this modus operandi. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;that's why conservatively-minded/stubborn people have trouble accepting new ideas,

Nice conservative shaming you snuck in there. The fact that change is not always and automatically for the better, but that things can actually get worse and then might be anywhere from difficult to impossible to fix is conveniently absent from your analysis. Conservatives know this and therefore opt to proceed with caution.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And again, feminism is a very broad and muddy term

Again, this is no coincidence since it allows feminists to use hyperaggressive tactics and then hide behind the dictionary definition.

For example, the genocidal feminism that runs all the way from radical 2nd wave feminism (Andrea Dworkin, Sally Miller-Gearhardt etc) right down to todays ""Men are obsolete"", ""The future is female"" etc

When a man correctly calls out this genocidal hate movement for what it is the respective feminist will drop back to ""but feminism is about equality!"". How dare you be against equality?! &lt;insert standard man shaming as per above here&gt; 

It is exactly this ""agress and cloak"" dynamic I spotted and called out in your post above.",1616923069

&amp;#x200B;

Bullshit, never happens to women, always happens to men. Men are victim blamed for their own murders much more often.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;On average women are weaker and less able to defend themselves from attack which increases nerves. 

&amp;#x200B;

Which leads to the conclusion that men are attacked more than women, in fact, enough that despite being better able to defend themselves, more men are seriously injured or killed by other people than women.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;When a man is murdered by a woman and it makes headline news, the top trending hashtag on twitter isn't #notallwomen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Except when a man is murdered by a woman, which rarely ever happens, nobody cares, because such things don't faze society, which doesn't care about men's lives. Also, why would the possibility of people saying ""#notall(X group) matter in making somebody more or less scared? The only time people say #notallmen is when a feminist says ""men are x."" People on twitter rarely make sweeping, sexist generalisations about women, dumbass. So ofc, #notallwomen never trends.

Women are scared on the street because historically they have been told they have to be. When that poor woman in Britain got murdered my local newspaper ran a story on how 'women could protect themselves' and gave a list of things not to do, all of which would never be given to a man.

Women have been blamed for their own death because of what they were wearing or where they were. Men are rarely blamed for their own murders. 

On average women are weaker and less able to defend themselves from attack which increases nerves. Also again (and I mean specifically in a street situation) they are more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted.

This whole thing was brought up because a woman who had taken every precaution that are published in those silly 'protect yourself' articles was still not safe.

If you use the logic that men should be equally as scared as women because they're more likely to get murdered, then yeah you are right. But there is a reason men are not as scared.

Men are not as scared as women because they are not constantly told they should be scared. They are never warned they may be assaulted when they leave the house because they're shorts are too short. They're never blamed for being murded when they walk through a dark park on their way home.

When a man is murdered by a woman and it makes headline news, the top trending hashtag on twitter isn't #notallwomen.

But from a outsider perspective , someone completely unrelated to people in the story- maybe his timing wasn't best (?) But overall, this was his dream and he knew it wouldn't sit right with him to not have kids. If his  'future dream' isn't a good enough reason to end an engagement, then what is? 

I feel it's very unhealthy to think like that tbh, she can find someone who does not want to have biological  kids and be happy.

It was feminists that protested men's summits to discuss men's issues like mental health and plummeting school performance. The nonsense in Toronto comes to mind. The only people to condemn it in any reasonable number are MRAs and egalitarians.

It's feminists that have prevented Great Britain from recognizing men being victims of raoe. By their definition in law *men can not be raped by a woman.*

Feminists have opposed a gender neutral draft every time the issue is raised.

It's feminists that pushed the asinine Duluth model which by it's very existence is an insult to the idea of equality before the law. It is a law enforcement model that always treats the man in a situation as the suspect. Nevermind the idiocy of using that in a same-sex couple situation it's been used to ignore male victims and enable their abusers.

[https://honest-ribbon.org/mega-featured/duluth-model-buries-key-facts-on-domestic-violence/](https://honest-ribbon.org/mega-featured/duluth-model-buries-key-facts-on-domestic-violence/)

It's feminists that try to not only maintain the absurd double standards in the judicial systems of the world but also to *widen them*. It's no secret that ""men go to prison; women go to therapy"". Assuming a woman even gets a sentence she will serve a significantly reduced sentence compared to a male counterpart for identical crimes. This is pushed by feminists and I see none of them calling this out in large numbers, or in any numbers really. They don't care, they like this status quo.

On top of this their efforts have gone to prevent and shut down men's shelters. Male victims have no where to go and often end up homeless or with substance abuse problems.

Then you have real winners like Mary Koss who is responsible for trying to bury facts about male victims. This isn't some nobody loudmouth she is a influential feminist responsible for leading CDC studies and is part of their think tank. She has gone on record saying men and boys can not be raped.

Don't get me wrong there are a handful of feminists still around I can respect. Christina Hoff Summers still calls herself a feminist, for reasons that are beyond my comprehension since she is basically a pariah now for sticking up for men and rejecting inter-sectional feminism as the sectarianism that it is. There is a reason she is called ""based mom"" and when she talks she has my undivided attention something I can not say of many others, feminist or otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; For me, feminism is about equality of all sexes and genders. 

Then you're not a feminist, you're an egalitarian. A lot of feminists will regurgitate the trite dictionary definition to deflect criticism. Specifically:

&gt;Belief in or advocacy of women's social, political, and economic rights, especially with regard to equality of the sexes. 

The focus is one women and it's done exclusively so. So by both definition and deed feminists do not stand for men, we are a litmus for feminists to use to measure their own standing against. Not even all men either, just the most affluent or well off ones. This is called Apex Fallacy. Where you only use the top examples of something. How often do you hear other feminists whining about ""lack of women in CEO positions"" even though to 99.9% of men those positions are equally as unattainable? Yet you never hear for a big push to put women into equal blue collar positions. They exist in these positions but if you walk onto a construction site odds are the woman is a college educated contractor or MBA type not a rank and file worker. It's like spotting a rare white elk if they're actually getting down and dirty. 

&gt; But everyone sees feminism differently. 

You're right. For instance I see it as an ingrained and institutional power that acts like it's still the underdog fighting ""the man"" or ""the establishment"" or that ever present and all powerful ""patriarchy"". I see any and all good intentions that was once part of the movement has been warped and shaped into a hammer with which to beat people down. Not least of all because of things like this: [https://archive.is/AWSEN](https://archive.is/AWSEN)

Read it. One of my favorites is the bit about feminists harassing the woman, Erin Pizzy, that established shelters for women for the crime of going against the narrative established about domestic violence. They threatened her, stalked her, smeared her because she dared suggest that domestic violence is not one sided.

Or how Canadian Feminists harassed the founder of the ONLY male shelter and had the government run interference in denying him funding until he was driven to suicide.

These are just drops in the ocean and doesn't even begin to cover how they screw over men in the cases of sexual assault, rape, and false accusations. There's a lot more in this collection of incidents and black marks. There's bad apples and extremists in any group sure but they sure seem to be common in feminism and the moderate sit by and only offer ""but it's not TRUE feminism because feminism is X, Y, and Z"" as a way to make it look like they care. In effect it stops nothing and the ""extremists"" get to run the show. It's a tidy little arrangement. 

If this was actually a handful of bad apples I'd even agree with you that it's only ""some"" but this is well and beyond ""some"". Even if numerically the majority of feminists were decent people the policy makers and influential members are complete nutcases more interested in protecting the power they have amassed or keeping revenge based IDPOL going than they are in actual equality.

I called myself one a long time ago and when I needed them most they hung me out to dry. Repeatedly. They're not interested in helping men and for all the talk of equality they really don't give a shit about equality if it's not about women.

Since we have come to an agreement upon the fact that the high birth rate in Pakistan causes great difficulties for Pakistani society itself as well as for nations that have to absorb the people emigrating from Pakistan to build a future for themselves that Pakistani society is evidently not capable to provide for them, can you see/acknowledge why those other countries might conduct a feminist foreign policy towards Pakistan?

I mean, feminism for all it flaws has one very reliable effect: *It lowers birth rates.*

Since Pakistan is a nuclear power headed towards severe social disintigration (due to high birth rate) and we already have to clean up your demographic spillover for you at great cost for our societies and Pakistan is either unwilling or uncapable to address this issue with necessary urgency (or most likely a bit of both), we apparently need to manage the risk that this Pakistani unwillingness/incapability causes for the global community.

Since Pakistan doesn't care about the negative effects it has on the interantional community, why should we care about your cultural sensibilities while mitigating those negative effects?

For example (briefly), women really have a higher degree of control in relationships and in families (even though they don't look it or act like it is not the case). They are entitled to their man's income but not the other way around. Generally speaking, for marriage the male has to have his shit together while the female has to just accept. Some women say ""I'm just as girl"" and get away with a lot of shit where males are expected to ""man up"". The list goes on, but I hope you got the point.",1616935168

It's just not. You don't know why I am pissed over feminism. No it's not just because ""some"" feminists seems to want to overpower men, it's not that simple.

You are doing a strawman. Where did I said that the problem was solely on the fact that this account was only for women ? Because I didn't. In fact, it's not even a problem in itself, it's a symptom. If there's no TwitterMen account it's because Twitter as a company is just following trends, this account is just for PR. If they didn't made a TwitterMen account it's because they know they would receive a lot of backlash and they don't want to face it. Hence why people are angry at that. It's just showing how men are perceived in society, we can't have support.

Fighting ""for equality for women""? Don't you think it doesn't make any sense lmao. Equality is between 2 things at minimum, but you purposefully said ""equality for women"", why not ""equality between women and men""?
I know that there are aspects where men are more in power and vice versa and I absolutely agree, I'm an egalitarian, I thrive for equality for all humans, but you don't even ask yourself why I'm that mad over feminism (well you don't because you made up some reasons), why would feminism have the exclusivity of ""equality"" anyway ?
The thing that convinced me that feminism is absolutely not about equality is this scene in The Red Pill (https://youtu.be/48DQMoQ1QJ8l), I considered myself a feminist when I first saw this movie but to me it wasn't making sense that those people were protesting at some men talking about the issues they were facing and calling them names. There's even a woman saying that she would like to have both men and women talking about their issues yet she's protesting against them ???

So maybe you are being honest, you really think feminism is about equality and all, but it's really not. You can't be about equality when you shutdown any people who wants to speak about problems you don't get. You have to at least let them speak, understand what they are talking about and then get angry if there's something to be angry about, but just shutting down people before or when they speak just shows that you are afraid of what they might say.
If you are honest, if you really thrive for equality in society, please dig deeper into the subject, give more attention to problems men are facing, at least as much as women's, and you will reach the same conclusion as me : feminism ain't about equality, just be an egalitarian.

This was founded by two psychologists who are quite critical of the feminist bent that psychology has taken in the recent decades. Therefore they built this community for men to share their problems and be communal and helping each other.

Also, Tom Golden (who is a psychotherapist who specializes in men's issues and is a co-founder of the aforementioned community) has a website where you can contact him:

Women are 91% of rape victims, and that's only the reported ones. They have to be far more wary than men while walking home at night because of this. They're also the majority of domestic abuse victims. Women are under more pressure to look nice, get laughed if they don't and get gawked at and potentially groped in the street if they do. Their natural physical inferiority to men leaves them far more vulnerable to violence. Women experience general sexism all the time, just look at in video game chats when someone hears a female voice, or when a YouTube comment has a woman in their profile picture. That's a problem ingrained in society.

2. Same with sex. Sex before marriage is forbidden and most men and women will strictly follow it too. So it will be extremely rare to find pregnancy in women before marriage. So you wouldn't find anything promotions like birth control or stuff like that.

What I gathered from western countries about ""My body, my choice"" is that it is usually based on these two things. So promoting something like that here would be pointless.

Only thing I know, is that you have a pretty high birth rate (28 births / 1000 inhabitants as per UN data)  and in combination with rising live expectancy that creates a very young population, which brings predictable problems with respect to social stability.

If there are a lot of young people in a country, they want/need economic opportunities to make a living for themselves (and their future families). It has often been observed that the economies of countries with very high birth rates can't keep up with the population growth which leads to wage stagnation or even wage decrease for everyone due to an oversupply of workers.

Am I ashamed to be in the ""MRA movement""? Definitely not. I mostly don't call myself a MRA, because gendered labels tend to create tribalism. Sometimes I may call myself feminist or MRA if I think it helps the discussion, either by using the same label as the person I'm talking to or an unexpected label. On twitter I discuss and share my views and advocate for men under my real name, so even that isn't an issue (but there is less ""cancel-culture"" issues for employee in europe because of laws protecting workers).

The reason I'm more critical of feminism is because it holds power. There are bad MRAs, but they don't have any power. Government agencies push misleading statistics about domestic violence, wage gap and others, create sexist laws and sexist international conventions, all of this due to the influence of feminism.",1616947455

But even so, there are *still* fewer women in STEM. To a rational person, the obvious explanation is that women simply don't want to work in STEM fields as much as men do.

Sorry to bring up other political topics, but it feels the same as when people *insist* that if January 6th had been carried out by black people, they'd all be dead. It's based on nothing but conjecture, and that conjecture is based on the idea in people's heads that racism is far worse than it actually is. There's no evidence that if they had been black, they'd all be dead. But because people have convinced themselves that racism is so rampant, they believe that's the case. And that argument is toxic, because it just feeds into it even more, convincing even more people of something which might not even be true.

It's important to avoid that. I do believe that men get a raw deal in the criminal justice system. But it's important not to continually fan the flames back and forth by throwing out baseless assumptions that if a woman had been a man, she'd be treated worse.

1578,MensRights,"Whilst I agree there are definite biological traits in men and women that should be respected, they do not completely define us in the same way that our brains have evolved to moderate our basic impulses with reason so that our impulses no longer completely control us. Human beings are remarkably plastic in adapting to new situations if there is just cause.

There is certainly merit in getting back on track with honouring our biological traits, instead of allowing feminist fads to direct our evolution into self-serving directions, however reason should be the guiding factor in how we moderate those biological traits.

We also need to consider that there is indeed diversity in human beings: homosexuality is a reality that blends some female traits with male traits, so we can't insist on essentially male individuals being forced or encouraged to behave totally like a stereotypical heterosexual man. That was attempted in forcing homosexual men to become heterosexual men and it not only failed it damaged those it tried to cure.

I believe there is greater diversity than we realise, so it is not appropriate to try to mold every male into a traditional man. I can accept that some men are confused by the constant barrage to be more like women, but there will be others who do actually have some female traits who would benefit from having them accepted.

The difficulty is in discerning what traits are so intimately linked to our biology that they are essentially immutable and should not ever be attempted to be changed and which traits are more to do with unreasoning tradition and can be improved.

I think your innate desire of men to protect and provide is actually raw sex drive evolved with reason that protecting and providing for a woman is optimal in having readier access to sex, plus it has symmetry with a woman wanting to protect and provide for a child which she can't do alone: it's effectively an exchange that is reasonably well balanced. I believe we have evolved further from that point but in a direction that has women now wanting everything, including control over sex without giving anything in return to maintain the balance. Furthermore, in order to achieve this, I believe women want to convert men into women with penises and that attempt at conversion is what we are seeing reflected in the confusion of young men, because it goes against their most fundamental trait of their pursuit of sex, which they feel but are told it should not exist for the comfort of women.

I had always understood that a man's fundamental drive was to spread his seed widely and perhaps that was how it was at the start, until maybe he reasoned that a stable relationship with a single woman provided more sex than trying to obtain it with many reluctant women.

Thus I would say that some traits can evolve where they offer the potential for improvement, but there will always be the immutable drive for sex underlying it all (and maybe some others I haven't addressed). Unfortunately evolution is not heading in the direction of improvements for men, but the converse of ""improvements"" for women at the expense of men.

I also don't agree with walking a path alone: the indigenous Australian men's corroborees, etc reflect a history of men's groups to guide a man's development. It's only modern society that has largely abandoned guidance for its young and replaced it by permissiveness (to go it alone by trial and error) which is confusing to young people who need direction.

The tendency for men to go it alone stems, I think, from the competitive spirit being encouraged rather than the cooperative spirit. Competition leads to division and is a good match for the capitalist system, but it ultimately is not a good outcome for a society that relies on its cohesion from cooperation and I think why society is crumbling.

As an exercise, perhaps we should try identifying fundamental biological traits and others that are more socially influenced.",1616940510

1609,MensRights,"Ok, I see. I indeed misunderstood/misinterpreted your position from your original/initial post. My sinciere apoligies for this shortcoming on my side.

The problem with the culturally sensitive approach is that it is slow. And in the case of Pakistan, in my humble opinion, it is too slow. It brings about the long lasting trans-generational change that is needed, but in the case of Pakistan, there is simply not enough time for this approach alone to resolve the situation.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/lnsbxz/iranian_women_standing_up_to_clerics/) you can see a video (maybe you have already seen it) from your neighbour to the west. Very different country/culture/political system for sure, but it shows what the ""not so culturally sensitive"" approach can provide: Fast change in the face of entrenched couter-productive cultural norms.

So maybe see it like this:

The culturally unsensitive approach is not meant to be liked or to appeal that was neither its aim, nor its purpose. In the metaphor of ""[the carrot and the stick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_and_stick)"", it is clearly playing the role of the stick.

Since Islam allows the husband to beat the wife (as a meassure of last resort) with a stick, provided that the stick is no thicker than his thumb, consider the culturally insensitive approach to be the stick with which the women's movement can ""beat back"" uncooperative men/institutions.

Where previously the ""culturally sensitive"" approach might have been considered the ""extreme"" position, it is now the ""middle of the road"" position.

So, maybe this perspective helps in understanding the overall strategy better.

In case you don't already know him and are interested in understanding the links between cultural norms, demographics, economy and the wealth and welbing of a society more deeply, I can not recommend [Hans Rosling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezVk1ahRF78) enough.

1673,MensRights,"&gt;how does the feminist movement influence the government so greatly?

I think they are just very good at lobbying... and lying. I've come to the conclusion that whenever you see a statistic pushed by feminists, you can bet what they say is false. But people don't have the knowledge and time to find the source and check if what is said is correct. When I put a link to a 100 page study on wage differences on twitter, people tend to not want to read it.

Also, both conservatives and ""progressives"" are very happy to favor women and dismiss men in issues of parenting and violence - they are both very traditionalist in that regard. They only differ on some points like abortion.

&gt;30% of state legislatures are woman; 26.4% of state senate seats; 30%  state house or assembly seats 

There is also the question of how many women are member of a party. I think it's about 30% (at least in Germany). How do you vote for women when they are not even there to get elected?

And then you read this:

&gt;You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female  member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum  could not be met and the bill died then and there. (source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/695m34/karen\_straughans\_response\_to\_those\_arent\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/695m34/karen_straughans_response_to_those_arent_real/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=LeftWingMaleAdvocates&amp;utm_content=t3_lec134)  )

So basically, feminists avoided shared parenting, which would have equalized parenting duties, which would in turn have given more time for mothers to get involved in politics. I honestly hope that this sexist politic won't be the politic they support when there are more women in politics.

Because it turns out, men are still voting for laws favoring women, influenced by the feminist narrative. Women are quite well represented by men, because men tend to favor women.

On the other hand, there are female MRAs, and they do quite a good job. So the big issue isn't men/women involved in politics.The issue is sexist people - which includes feminists - representing us.",1616949499

Commitment goes deep as living with someone's good life principles. There are old couples who lasted the relationship for more than 50 years and married men aren't always stimulated visually by their wives, they have long lasting relationship because they live by their life principles and deep values.

&gt;Whoosh, right over your head!

&gt;The reason this is important is that feminists adhere to the lie that men are dangerous and that women are justified in being afraid of men because men pose a significant danger to women (which is clearly not the case). They frame the argument as being one of safety for women, but their disinterest in suicide as an issue underlines the fact that feminists in fact don’t care about women’s safety since suicide is a far graver threat to women. Their concern about “femmicide” is about spreading fear and hatred against men. It’s not about women’s safety.

Why is it that everytime I queried something with one of you, you can't help but respond with condescension or passive aggression? Do you not know how to debate with reason and rationality? Or are you just so angry at us females you can't control your emotions, so cross 😡

The point I'm making, is that you are pointing out the **blindingly obvious** as if it is some light bulb moment, when common sense should have told you that anyway. 

Feminists have never argued that men kill women more than women kill themselves. They'd argue that more men commit violent acts against women than do woman, for sure. It is far more reasonable to compare genders in homicide rates than bringing suicide into the equation. 

The only people who seem to be surprised by this common sense information, are you ""men's rights"" activists not feminists, so what exactly have you achieved? Other than to perhaps to feel more validated in your beliefs and cogntivie distortions.

And if you genuinely believe that feminists don't care about female mental health then perhaps I can understand why you were so surprised that suicide figures exceed homicide figures, because you must be pretty damn ignorant. There are an abundance of mental health charities geared towards women that were founded by feminists. And feminism as an epistemology has a whole wealth of literature on mental health so I've no idea where you arrived at that conclusion.",1616956248

I can give you 10 more links are sources, tell you to read this and that but it is all useless. As I said, go to any lawyer/cop , a woman lawyer/cop all you want. They will tell you how incredible false rape cases are.

&amp;#x200B;

i had written the below post in r/ india around 2 weeks ago but for some reason the post was deleted.

"" 

My mother, a lawyer(quite a reputed one) tells me that 70-75% of all rape cases filed in Mumbai are false/non genuine. I have been warned by my mother never to use dating apps or to ever be in a live-in relationship. Even on the internet I remember reading an article by a woman lawyer from Delhi who described herself as a feminist stating how 90% of all rape cases in Delhi are false. I did not think much about it until a colleague of mine was threatened with one and had to pay 1 lakh in avoid to be implicated in a false rape case . After researching about it and talking to several people the issue seems to bigger than I ever thought of. Most rape cases in tier 1, tier 2 cities are just women filing it after a relationship turns sour. In many cases, it is the woman's parents that file rape cases. In northern India, especially in Delhi, many parents file rape cases against the girl's ex-boyfriend/lover just to dissuade him from ever talking to the girl again. Many parents also file rape cases against the girl's ex-boyfriend/lover as a rape victim is considered to more honourable than the girl having previous relationship. A rape victim has to give less dowry than the girl having past relationship. This might seem absurd and even laughable , but it happens. and it happens a lot

Some tips to avoid being implicated in a false rape case.-

1. Never, just never have sexual relation with your girlfriend until you get married to her. In India, a man can never leave his girlfriend after he has had sexual relations with her. Heck, he can never leave her even if he sees her fucking with another man. That is how fucked up Indian laws are.

2)If possible never ever talk to your female colleagues in your office. Now this might seem extreme to some but these days you never know. People who work in young startups probably know what I am talking about. There is a huge division these days between men and women working in young startups. Even in USA where I lived and wasted 4 years of my life I could see how divided men and women were in my office post the me-too movement. I see a similar trend happening in India these days.

3)Never hire a female maid if possible. Maids falsely implicating the men in the house has become really really common.

4) Do not ever argue with women for parking spots and don't ever get into a road rage fight with a woman for the woman can charge you under sec 354(outraging the modesty of the woman)

Now this doesn't take away the fact that most genuine cases (90%) go unreported or that much of India especially the Hindi Heartland can be an absolute nightmare for women. All I am talking about is tier 1 and tier 2 cities.

Edit: For people who think that cases which are not proved in court are termed as false cases are wrong. For example-USA has a rape conviction of around 25-30%. But 70% rape cases are not considered false. I am talking about cases which are proved to be downright false after due process of court. I am also talking about cases where the girl has filed the complaint on 'false pretext of marriage'

Edit 2-I write this post after doing extensive research on this topic for one whole month. In the space on 1 month I talked to some 11-12 lawyers.(almost everyone in my extended family is a lawyer) ,a cop, read several articles. I could back up my claims with endless sources and links but choose not to. For people who doubt what I have written, they can themsel go to any cop/lawyer in any tier 1/tier 2 city they want to .""",1616955294

Last time I went to Islamabad it was around the same time as the women's azadi march, from what I've learnt about Pakistani feminists is that there are two types.

1785,MensRights,"I don't think it's no different for women. I feel like the way I see sexually appealing guys and gals has the same stimulation for when men sees a sexually appealing woman. I think the only reason why advertisements doesn't have sexually appealing men for female products is that we get stimulated visually but it's not enough reason to blindly purchase commercial goods. 

It's the same sentiment for why people don't feel sexually harassed when I'm near them. I find people sexually appealing but it's not enough reason to make them feel uncomfortable. 

I'm not yet married so I have no say for married couples but when I was in a serious relationship, clothes didn't matter at all. I wore shorts and good-looking clothes because they make me feel good. I liked the feeling of being pretty even in ordinary clothes. Not once did it occur to me to wear revealing clothes just so I can attract people. 

I sincerely think that if partners want to keep their options open, they wouldn't seek it from shallow people who gets easily sexually tensed over some skin. The reason she's with you isn't because you got sexually aroused when you saw her pretty, it's because you're a good natured person so if she likes to seek other partners, it'll be someone who is much good-natured as you are but less toxic.",1616955114
1786,MensRights,"I mean

stuff here in south africa is kind of weird in terms of a lot of stuff, like court doesn't really have the people besides the judge, the accused, accuser and their lawyers, there aren't the civilians is what I mean.

like there's a bunch of murder I guess but there's also a large amount of rape-last I heard the rate's roughly 33%? Which isn't good considering I've got many female relatives

and that's bad enough, but also of course the court's response to rape cases, the defendant's lawyer strategy is usually to intimidate the victim into silence with lots of questions, which is hard on them as... well you know, now the strategy's bad enough, but a lot of the time, when they have all the evidence they need, guy still goes free, due to judges here being weird.

I mean at least the healthcare here's better, though. I mean you can give birth for free, at least. Like, it would be cheaper to fly from the USA to a hospital here, recover here and then fly back than just the cost of giving birth, there. 

Gotta love how some feminists care about smaller issues in america (like sexist air-conditioning), but bigger issues like rape in south africa, lotsa human rights violations in (specifically urban like small isolated villages) India (the cities are hellholes for dudes legally, though.) and I'm sure other countries, they don't talk as much about.

In discourse like this one, you shouldn't expect people to only validate your points, like you said in your post ""i dont get this"". You're not here for validation but for clarity. I'm not here to only disagree with you blindly. 

&gt;asking men to be okay with other psychopaths and people stare in an uncomfortable way checking their partners definitely is.

Just like what you said here, I agree with it. We shouldn't be okay with psychopaths and people stares in an uncomfortable way towards your partner. 

I don't think I got my point across but I hope you'd understand if I explain it this way:

[Grandma gets murder-raped](https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/granny-75-raped-and-murdered-allegedly-by-men-posing-as-soldiers-mec-20200330), [infant raped](https://www.fox23.com/news/trending/10-month-old-girl-dies-after-being-raped-by-father/DQJARLJIMFGT3I3F763IB6DVHU/), women and men gets sexually harassed regardless of the clothes they wear. If we lumped every cases together, we all hate the perpetrator and their actions are merely on their own accord.

Just like when I got sexually harassed few years back, I was wearing turtle neck, long sleeves, the only skin you would see was the hand and my face. No amount of victim shaming would be acceptable as I didn't show any skin on that uneventful day, nor would it be acceptable if someone tells me I was just unlucky to bump with a pervert. I'm not sure if you've heard about ""siding with the perpetrator"" but strictly criticizing the victims for what they wear and what do in an uneventful situation is almost the same as letting perpetrator harass people just because ""it's their nature to be like that"". 

I agree that we shouldn't be okay with psychopaths making us uncomfortable with their stares but what I disagree on is how we should just pin it on the victim (or the partner).

Even when my mental health deteriorated because of those situations, I dressed carelessly, didn't care if I smelled or looked good. Nothing changed even if I got suicidal about it, I still got harassed afterwards. Perverts will continue to harass people because they're being allowed to. Allowed in a way that they can just say ""men are men"" or ""boys are boys"" or ""it's their fault for being attractive"" or ""it's what men are designed to do"" and get away with it. Even if I die, perverts will continue to just harass people with such excuses we allow them to say. 

You can even say that my points validates the very purpose of your research findings, we don't have to disagree when we're both on the same side (we don't like our partners to be harassed). 

We are sexual creatures. It's perfectly normal to have sexual attraction. Females are no different from men, we get aroused through similar stimulus as well. I can say that because I'm female myself. In the abstract of your link stating how females are attracted through emotions, feelings, and other stuffs like that is only seemed that way because that's what makes a person committed. No females say ""love at first personality"", the phrase goes ""love at first sight"" for all sexes. Attraction is stimulated visually, that's what we call physical attraction. It's not gender isolated that men only experience physical attraction and women only experience emotional attraction.",1616961234

1865,MensRights,"You can't fix gynocentrism. It's hardwired into our species for men to protect and provision for women.

However, what always made it fair and effective is that men were given the authority to protect and provision. Women, being physically weaker and vulnerable when bearing children, had a biological need to transfer accountability for the family's safety to men. In order for men to take accountability, they also required authority. You can't protect a person that refuses to listen to you.

The problem we see is gynocentrism, which is the female privilege of abdicating accountability to men, has run rampant while its necessary counterpart, male authority, has been completely squashed.

Western countries are mostly democracies, where the vote of the majority holds the power. Since women are slightly more of the population and have a much stronger in-group bias, they tend to vote as bloc and they tend to vote for policies that, on the surface, benefit themselves. The problem we see is just going to continue to get worse, because women, as a group, hold much more political power.

The only way to fix gynocentrism in Western society is to reestablish patriarchy and curb female power. Which, that doesn't get rid of gynocentrism, which is simply hardwired into our biology, but it balances it out in a system that works. However, since voting rights are the only way to do that, it won't get done. Men have collectively agreed that women should have equal power in the voting booth; there's not any political will among men to collectively curb the female voting bloc.

Some folks have proposed an alternative: that only net tax payers (those who have a ""stake"" in the government) should be allowed to vote. I think this would be a good alternative, because it's not gender based and the net effect would be that it would deny people voting themselves more and more of the government's money (women collectively pay only half the taxes men do yet receive double the amount of total government benefits).",1616960308
