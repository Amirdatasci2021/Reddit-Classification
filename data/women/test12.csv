AskFeminists,"I never realized that before, thank you a lot, it's really opened my eyes a lot more. Of all the major social media platforms I see most conversations happening on twitter, so I thought it was mainly there. Like for instance I've talked a lot about ADHD (cause I have it) and when I finally saw it trending a few weeks ago, it felt like it was finally being talked about. It also took me a long time to finally find a pocket online where ADHD was actually being talked about too. 

I'll take your advice because I've spent the past few days away from twitter and I've felt a lot happier and now I'm more inclined to find the conversations I'm looking for somewhere else. Like just looking through one of the subreddits recommended to me on this thread I noticed a huge difference in the language being used.",1615398695

AskFeminists,"So I'm telling you what I am because I know SM uses that format-- it's a problematic and ineffective format, but you're using it precisely because that's what other people do. You think that's how a conversation about an important issue 'supposed' to go.

To put it gently- twitter is a great platform for short, punchy communication. It's meant to be a little abrasive, abrupt-- that's the nature of the platform. But as fun as it is, twitter is not where 'everything' happens and it's not true that just because something isn't a trending hashtag it isn't important and no one cares about it.

My best advice to you would be to spend less time online so you can recalibrate your conversational style and capacity.

I know for me that the communication 'styles' associated with many SM platforms have resulted in me not even using twitter and curtailing my participation on other platforms-- because I don't think they promote effective or meaningful conversation.",1615397763

I’ve seen a lot of conversations brought up using that kind of language. I was just trying to find where the conversation I’m looking for, my intention wasn’t to shame anyone. I’ve tried a couple times on social media to talk about it but I’ve never found any engagement for it, so I honestly just didn’t know where to look for it.
Tbh now everything I’ve learned from people’s responses to this thread has made me realize how bad social media is (or at least twitter) with looking for the conversation I’m looking for. I also know I’m horrible at communicating what I’m trying to say so sorry for that.",1615396630

AskFeminists,"&gt;There's a particular book I have in mind

Then it sounds to me like you already know what to read.

Workhouses or poorhouses existed for both men and women, and they weren't necessarily 'for' battered or 'fallen' people-- though certainly some institutions did exist with the explicit purpose of putting poor widows and otherwise 'fallen' women to work. 

I think you have to keep in mind that spousal abuse, in the US and many other countries, was perfectly legal. It wouldn't be seen as a 'valid' reason to leave a marriage and women who did so prior to it becoming recognized as legally valid would be considered social outcasts, aka, 'fallen' women.",1615396326

AskFeminists,"I personally find this kind of absolutism very frustrating. You make these general statements like, ""No one"" is talking about this-- the conversations are ""never"" present-- but at the same time admit you haven't been active in trying to find spaces or people where these things are discussed online.

I think it's way less productive to try to shame people into talking about an issue you want to talk about by accusing them of not caring or purposefully ignoring something (and yes, though it may not be your intention-- this kind of ""no one"" language is absolutely antagonistic and shaming) than it is to be pro-active about something you care about.

If ""not enough"" people on social media are engaged in this topic and you really care about it-- then you need to signal boost those topics and show some leadership for increasing the visibility of the things you care about in a way you think is appropriate- sitting around waiting for someone else to do it for you is truly baffling to me.",1615394981

AskFeminists,"I struggled a lot with internalized misogyny. I also lived on fantasy and adventure books, and I think those played a role in how I wanted to present myself to the world.

I was also bullied quite a bit, so I think I started trying to find an identity in ""not fitting in"", because the more I tried to ""fit in"" the worse it got for me because I was very, very bad at understanding and reacting to social cues. That combined with the internalized misogyny translated into ""I have to act like the boy characters in the books I read"" for me for a good part of my childhood.

Oh, also, I'm gay. So there's that, lol. I have some gender stuff I've \*barely\* scratched the surface of, too, though it's all so hard to untangle-- I've only just come to terms with being a lesbian in the last few years. I grew up in a religious family and kid me being gay would have been wholly unacceptable, even if I hadn't been ostracized at school.

I think I can understand what you're saying about the romantic narrative between girls and boys. I really, really didn't want to kiss or marry a boy (though at the time I thought I was making that feeling up and would eventually want that) and being a tomboy might have been another act of rejection for me.",1615394446

AskFeminists,"1) Do you understand what cancelling means? Or are you just mad about it because you feel it's 'unfair' or 'goes too far'?

2) If his sister has unresolved feelings about what happened, or never knew it happened and found out as an adult-- then regardless of when the incident occurred or why he is definitely accountable to apologizing to *her,* at the very least. He did a wrong; he should seek to correct that wrong if he is able. This can look a variety of ways and may or may not be a 'public' event.

3) If someone apologizes to one person they behaved inappropriately towards, but then continues to behave that way in future interactions-- that suggests that they weren't accountable for the behaviour. The work they did towards remediating the harm they caused wasn't genuine-- they apologized as a means to escape accountability. They are still liable, therefore, for the harm that they caused. A trend like this might be called a ""pattern of behaviour"" and suggests that a private or public confrontation regarding the offender is not adequate to correct or deter the person from continuing to harm others-- a more serious consequence or intervention may be required.",1615394084

The problem with this whole thread trajectory is that you are outraged, at me, about something that largely doesn't happen the way that you've decided it has.

AskFeminists,"I think you misunderstood what I said. Being a man gives you a bonus over being a woman (at least in most societies), this applies to all of them. But then, there are many other parameters and ""bonuses"" like being white, being rich, being intelligent, etc. Each human being starts with ""bonuses"" and ""maluses"" (I don't know how to express this differently). And because all humans are made of many different qualities and characteristics, it does happen than men will be less privileged than some women.

But, the fact is that, in our societies, we put values and hierarchies between the differences between humans, and in that sense, being a man is considered more valued, it gives you an advantage, and this applies to anyone being in that category. But of course, you're not only ""a man"", you are many other things that will influence your place in society.

And yes there are advantages a black man has over a woman. You could become president of the USA for example. Or in some countries, you'd have much more rights than women. Or, you have less chances to be sexually assaulted, etc. This of course doesn't mean all black men have it better than all white women.

It's like saying men are generally taller than women. It doesn't mean ALL men are taller than ALL women; it doesn't mean that you cannot find MANY women who are taller than MANY men, etc... but the general statement still is true: men are generally taller than women.",1615377436

US women have traditionally been a market for TV advertising who are just expected to buy what they see and so they were offered aspirational tokenism fit for the male gaze primarily. Men didn't want to see regular women on TV and women wouldn't buy their Nordstrom dresses. 

I think it's worth noting that the BBC revenue doesn't come completely from advertising. I'm pretty sure all/most of TV station revenue in the US comes from advertising - and free-to-air television over there is fairly competitive.",1615432665
AskFeminists,"cool, and props for you to calling that. 

but what does having a need to dominate sexually has to be equal to rape? the key word missing in a sexual act and rape is consent and that's the bedrock. if two people consent, what type of activity and with what dynamic they engage in it doesn't matter. 

i mean we might agree on this that beating a random person out of the blue just to test your street fighting skills is the definition of arsehole behavior but when you wrestle with your siblings for fun, it's not arsehole behavior. both are acts of physical agression but labelling both as ""toxic masculinity"" and ""boys will be boys"" is like comparing a tea leaf with a cup of English tea.",1615432330

AskFeminists,"Buy *why* are men more likely to employ the methods they do compared to women? *Why* are their resulting rates of suicide higher?

Perhaps, due to the lack of support and counseling they receive, men are more likely to attempt suicide while in a deeper depressive state, and thus are ""sure"" of their decision. In contrast, perhaps women are more likely to still feel conflicted about their decision to commit suicide, and therefore employ less instantaneous methods.

Men are also more likely to self-medicate via substance abuse, which may have an effect on how and when they commit suicide. That choice to self-medicate could again be attributed to a feeling that they must deal with the problem themselves, rather than seek help.

You cannot simply say that there cannot be any relationship between suicide and social stigma surrounding mental health support simply because they don't attempt suicide more often than women.

In fact, there is [plenty of data to show that they seek help less often, and that this is correlated with holding more traditional views of masculinity](https://www.apa.org/monitor/jun05/helping).",1615415663

AskFeminists,[removed],1615415490
AskFeminists,"I think you're focusing too much on what you're calling, basically, ""arsehole behaviour"". An important thing to understand about toxic masculinity is that it's less about behaviour and more about the societal expectations that compel that behaviour; the kind of thing you're looking at *is* one example, in which, say, a man is expected to respond to an insult with violence (or at least the threat of violence), or else he is weak and unmanly. 

But toxic masculinity manifests in other ways. Just a couple of days ago a friend of mine ended up alone, in the drink, next to his upside-down boat, in an inlet in the damned Pacific, with no lifejacket, no radio, and bad chances. It was sheer dumb luck that another boat just happened to go past him and hear him yelling for help, and plucked him (and his dog) out of the water. He'd been in the water quite a while by that point and likely wouldn't have lasted much longer. But just try suggesting to this guy (I love him, but he makes bad choices sometimes) that perhaps he should have a life vest when he's on the water, and carry a handheld radio on his person, or maybe attach his damn killswitch cord when he's running... good luck. Because he's apparently more afraid of looking scared, or not-brave, or not-tough, and specifically *not-manly*, than he is of death itself. This is the kind of toxic masculinity that gets a lot of men killed - and nearly killed him on Monday.

Another example is men not reporting sexual assaults against them because they're worried that by asserting that they didn't enjoy it, they're somehow not ""real men"". Or men not reporting domestic violence because allowing oneself to be abused by a woman makes one a weakling.

So we're not just talking about ""arsehole behaviour"" here. We're talking about a whole societal notion of what a ""real man"" ought to be - a notion that can be held by men and women both - and examining just how destructive, and at times lethal, it can be.",1615414950
AskFeminists,"I really dislike the term ""toxic masculinity"" (mostly because I hate the term ""toxic""), but I think you're overlooking what the term is trying to get at a little bit.

Feelings of aggression are not intrinsically wrong. In fact, very few feelings or even impulses are wrong in and of themselves. What's *wrong* is the actions you take because of them. It's not wrong to be angry, but when angry is the only emotion deemed legitimate to express, and only in specific ways, that is very much a problem. Your experiences with expressing your emotions, or your friends' experiences, may be different, and that's great! I've noticed a lot of younger men who feel comfortable expressing a wide range of emotions. Personally, as a queer person, I've mostly lived in progressive communities and while I've had a couple run-ins with homophobia, I really haven't experienced all that much and don't usually even think about it when I'm out with friends or partners. But that does not mean that my experience is the same as other queer people.

Similarly, where gender socialization is concerned, there's research out there that paints a different picture of male socialization, one which may not affect your generation but certainly affects many men in their late 20s and 30s. If you have access to a library database, you can search for this research yourself. A quick search of my own brought up the following research: ""Confirming Gender Stereotypes: A Social Role Perspective"" (2003), which found that when men were put in high-stakes and emotionally vulnerable situations, they were significantly more likely to conform to gender stereotypes;  ""Silence and (in)visibility in men's accounts of coping with stressful life events"" (2016), which looks at strategies men use to mask stress and anxiety; and ""Individual Differences in Masculine Gender Socialization as Predictive of Men's Psychophysiological Responses to Negative Affect"" (2012). There's a lot of literature out there which is worth exploring!

AskFeminists,"I think that lots of man view the term ""toxic  masculinity"" as an attack, but they don't fully understand it. It may not be the absolute best terminology, but it is true. 

It is true that men have much worst outcomes when in it comes to suicide, medical outcomes, and can often suffer from mental health because they don't seek support. Toxic masculinity refers to social standard where men must be stoic, not show emotion, and not seek out help. Think of it more as gendered standards that are enforced on men, and ultimately have negative outcomes.

When people say ""remove gender from society, they are generally referring to the erosion of gender roles. For example, men can do jobs traditionally held by women.

AskFeminists,"agreed, and it was especially bad around 90s with all the govinda stuff raging. I still don't think that it's upon the movies to teach kids the meaning of consent, it's upon the parents and schools and that has been happening now. also, a bigger hindernce in putting it all together is the uneven nature of laws in India. the laws around rape, especially after nirbhaya episode tilted in favor of women  and a man still is mocked if he presses a rape charge against a woman. 

see, honestly what you're describing is bad parenting. it's upon parents and schools to impart that knowledge, to teach the difference between good and bad touch and to teach the concept of consent. but to address your point further, if a woman rapes a man... i won't automatically say that she did so because of femininity or that it's toxic.  that's where my gripe lies, because suggestions like toxic masculinity gives off a vibe that it's somehow ok or masculine to rape, which it absolutely isn't.

This and other experiences people have shared with me tells me that sexual assault is not some isolated behavior of some arseholes. It is a systemic, cultural problem that women’s rights are not valued. No one is actively teaching boys to rape, but many of them grow up without understanding what consent is because sexual assault is so commonplace.",1615408675

I agree, and that's why i feel it's a stupid thing to suggest. men who rape are egotistical arseholes who feel that they can loose masculinity if they don't control the surroundings. i mean when has fear of lack of control a sign of masculinity.

So rather than pointing to specific things that are 'red flags' that someone isn't a feminist-- I think it's safe to just talk about feelings. If you are feminist and in conversation feel safe about honestly expressing that-- then likely you are in a safe relationship with someone who isn't going to go out of their way to harm you on the basis of your identity or gender. 

If someone says things or behaves in a way that makes you feel unsafe or uncomfortable-- you can try to approach that person and have a conversation about it, and hopefully clear up a misunderstanding or some thoughtlessness on their part, or, if what they said or did is a boundary violation for you- disengage and do your best to avoid that person in the future, as you would anyone else who seemed to be making you feeling uncomfortable or unsafe on purpose.

The thing that's hardest is that you cannot always avoid or disengage and unsafe person or situation, or sometimes, because the situation is so unsafe-- you can't even reflect fully on whats going on and might only feel that way in retrospect-- that's okay.

also, i'd like to add that i wrote for Elizabeth,  the current queen and not the first one and that's why i said a ceremonial monarch because of the whole constitutional monarchy thing. in her reign, it has happened twice that the two most powerful positions in UK were both with women... first in the case of Thatcher and recently under Theresa may.

Republicans covered their bases with this a long time ago. In the 70s they pushed for an expansion of the lower courts to ensure the SCOTUS never got overburdened, which as it was a 7-2 (moderate) conservative majority at the time, they intended to destroy the prior precedent for packing so that it could reign unchallenged and unchanged for decades. Reagan then started the idea of swapping out the moderate conservative majority on that court with radicals that could serve a solid/far right wing agenda, but was blocked with people like Bork because the Dems had the senate. Things then deradicalized for a few decades but now the GOP is back to those same principles and ideas, and thanks to the lower court expansion 50 years ago, have wiped out the previous precedent for court packing.

AskFeminists,"&gt; Victoria was a monarch and controlled UK for a good 6 decades as a dictator. even under Elizabeth, the UK is a constitutional monarchy with the ceremonial head as a woman. how exactly is UK a patriarchy when for the majority of last two centuries, it was under Women, first literally and then figuratively. 

Well, if you know much about English history, I don't know how you can point to Elizabeth as anything other than an example of how the country was very much a patriarchy then.  Her father divorced his wife of over two decades, broke with the Catholic church, and beheaded a woman all to get a son (beheaded another woman for infidelity, too, and divorced another under the guise that she wasn't attractive enough, though his own impotence was probably more of an issue there).  That Elizabeth was the ""Virgin Queen"" and never married was precisely because of patriarchy.  Any man she married would have been King of England, and the English absolutely did not want a foreign king, and there was too much court in-fighting for anyone to accept a fellow lord as King.  Plus, there was all the drama with the Protestant leaders, especially those in Scotland, having a big issue with Queens ruling, especially if that made them head of the church as well.  Was quite the issue for Elizabeth and her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots.  Just because, due to her brother's sickliness and dying young, her father's illegitimate sons all dying young, and her older sister's death, Elizabeth managed to get on the throne, doesn't mean the entire system wasn't quite patriarchal.  

By Victoria's reign, the monarchy's power was by no means absolute, and the Prime Ministers during her reign (all of whom were men) had quite a bit of power themselves.  Worth noting, too, that at the time Victoria came to the throne, married women were not allowed to hold property in their own name, among a great number of restrictions of rights.  That every so often, due to deaths and lack of male heirs, a woman gets on the throne really doesn't prove England was not a patriarchy, especially if you look at the history of primogeniture and entail.  I mean, it's been in the 21st century when they finally changed the rule so that the first born child of the monarch, regardless of gender, would inherit.  Before that, it was always the firstborn son.",1615401828

that's what i meant when i said that the term toxic masculinity seems like a projection and i feel really put off when someone suggest ""teach your boys not to rape"". i mean come on, are parents really teaching their boys that it's ok to rape or is it just arsehole behavior that's projected on men.

no, i respectfully disagree.

AskFeminists,"The term ""toxic masculinity"" does **not** mean that masculinity, masculine traits, etc. are inherently ""toxic"". The term is used to describe how specific ideas of masculinity are thrust upon men in ways that are toxic to them and to others.

For example, being naturally stoic is not an inherently toxic trait. Making a man believe that he must be stoic and not express his emotions lest he seem like ""less of a man"" is toxic. That man may have emotions that need a healthy outlet, and if he does not think he should seek one, he may suffer negative effects to his own mental health and/or take out his emotions in unhealthy ways on others.",1615400214
AskFeminists,"""toxic masculinity"" was coined in the 70s by the mythopoetic men's movement, not by Gillette in 2019.

""toxic masculinity"" does not mean that all men or masculinity is bad. it is a specific term used to discuss aspects of traditional masculinity that, when borne out to their extremes, hurt men and others around them

the idea that ""men should just cry more"" is an extreme oversimplification. the only socially-approved method of emotional expression for men is anger; we tell men from day 1 that ""boys don't cry,"" ""man up,"" ""tough it out,"" etc. like, why do you think men are so reluctant to ask for help if they are suffering from anxiety, depression, etc.? we don't raise boys with the emotional toolboxes they need to work through a lot of feelings and emotions that they-- just like any other person-- has.

""feminists want to remove gender"" is also not really the case; most feminists advocate for the end of gender *roles*. we don't want to make it so that gender does not exist, or is not known. we just want people to feel free to do whatever they want, outside of the constraints of what we think men or women ""should"" be/do/look like/act like.

Would you be happy if people treated your body like a meatsack? A vessel? Would you like to be groped or handled as a thing? Because that's what we do with objects. 

The body itself can be a ""thing"", however, humans and animals aren't simply their bodies. We have consciousness, awareness, sentience. But for you knowledge, even when a human is non-aware, in a coma, it's a human, not a thing.

To me objectification is treating something as an object, but not claiming it to be *just* that object, especially not outside of the scope of the objectification. Hence, if I were to objectify someone I'd still recognize the rest of their personhood but just not concern myself with it in the particular matter.
&gt;Their opinions and feelings do not matter because they are not humans, but objects

To me, the notion of something being human and and an object are not mutually exclusive. A peron's body is an object to me, that doesn't detach the rest of that person from the human (personality, values, ideals, dreams, opinions, feelings) though and thus the objectification doesn't grant me the right to treat them as *just* objects like you go on.",1615465705

&gt; Could you define your interpretation of ""objectification"" for me please? 

Objectification is treating people, and animals sometimes, as objects, as things. 

Through the course of history, women couldn't vote, couldn't decide their futures, couldn't choose their spouses. They were objects of bargain, marriage was created to form alliances. This still happens as a group treatment, thankfully in the west things are more progressive, however, many countries and regions still remain this behaviors, bounded by law or not. 

&gt; Objectifying, to me, means focusing on the body of someone, 

This objectification is sexualization, but objectification does necessarily means something sexual. 

&gt; but I don't see how that's enabling someone to now ""own"" them? 

In milder cases, saying someone's ass is nice doesn't always translate as disrespect and objectifying. However, if this someone goes up to a stranger and say this randomly, in a  non-appropriate place such as club (where maybe the stranger is there to flirt or not), this can be seem as objectifying because you merely say something invasive about someone's body regardless of how they'll feel.

Under my current understanding of ""objectifying"", the notion of objectifying a group of people is incoherent so I guess it's really a different semantic interpretation of ""objectification""?Could you define your interpretation of ""objectification"" for me please?

Objectifying, to me, means focusing on the body of someone, without denying them the rest of their personhood but merely not concerning yourself with it at that moment.I would expect something like someone saying ""they have a nice ass"" to be seen as objectification, but I don't see how that's enabling someone to now ""claim them"" as their ownership?",1615464796
AskFeminists,"What is NOT wrong with objectification? Objectification means that you reduce a WHOLE PERSON (with personality, values, ideals, dreams, opinions, feelings, and all that stuff you know?) to their bodies and looks. This is **dehumanizing**. 

Objectification of women is one of the major causes why many women and young girls starting from the age of 12 have physical and psychological health problems related to their looks, such as eating disorders, anorexia, anxiety, depression. 

More importantly, it is one of the building blocks of the notion that women are bodies and commodities that are owned by others and exist for others. This notion is exactly the reason why women are not seen as equals and are mistreated, abused, violated. *Their opinions and feelings do not matter because they are not humans, but objects, so I can treat them however I like.* Sounds plausible, right? Consider how black people are still being mistreated, abused, and violated today because they were enslaved, owned, and not seen as equals by white people for centuries. Consider the mass murder of the ""uncivilized"" Native Indians by the ""civilized white men"" and the mass murder of the ""untermensch"" Jews by the ""übermench"" Nazis.

When you objectify a person you dehumanizes them, which means you compare and atributes value as if they were the same as a chair.

When women, as a group, are objectified, men, as the power holding group and majority, think that they own these ""objects"". 
Which leads us to fathers thinking they own their wives and daughters and can say what they dress with, what they can watch, where they can go, etc. When romantic partners do this is the same, and sometimes, these objectification causes the death of these women, who seemingly can't make their own decisions if these men don't approve it.",1615463129

Older people generally have more financial resources, more self confidence, know more about how the world works. It's very easy to influence, groom or manipulate a younger person who is still figuring themselves out. I've been very careful and I'm still shocked at times to see what kind of influence I had on younger partners and friends.

I would say there is a bit of benevolent sexism to only asking women if they need a walk home, but I put that more on a cultural issue rather than a you issue - we certainly hear a lot how things aren’t safe for women, and often they aren’t, so it’s not bad to want to help keep people safe.

For women talking about their sexuality over history, it's been seen as taboo. Or they've been called terrible names for being sexually independent and making the choice to have sex.

It's still an issue with people today. A lot of partners are obsessed with how much sexual experience their partner has. Or if they won't have sex with one particular person there's a chance that she'll be called a prude. Even women who don't feel sexual attraction, like people who fall on the asexual spectrum are often told that having sex could 'fix' them.

Women have been taught to handle their own sexual frustrations. Whereas men are often still encouraged to talk about having sex in a manner that they are getting something that they should all experience.

This is damaging to everyone, since many of them aren't taught to handle their own sexual frustration in a healthy manner. And women are left to minimize their own sexuality.",1615458265

In American women have some ridiculously high beauty standards thrown at them all the time.

If only they put in a little effort and bought the products.

As for men in television, if they're wanted to watch it then there is usually someone relatable to them. Or someone that they want to be. This is why you'll see the range from average-looking guys up through model-looking guys. With average men, they can relate to them and with good-looking men, that's someone that they might want to be.

AskFeminists,"My country South Africa should serve as an example to many.

Since the fall of apartheid in South Africa the representation of black people in the media has both increased and become more realistic and nuanced as opposed to only hearing the propaganda of a racist regime...

However a shift in the political class and shifts in representation alone do not translate into big changes within the economic structure of society.

As a white South African I live in what is essentially a bubble of first world amenities. Whereas the majority of the population (black) still live in deep poverty. This is the lagacy of apartheid town planning (which was a more extreme version of redlining)... 

This racist legacy is actually very persistent and has little to do with the (racist or otherwise) attitudes of people now. I live in a monster of a house that is worth literally millions, which I could never have afforded on my current salary. But my grandparents got it under the apartheid regime dirt cheap because it zoned and developed land for white people. 

Now my black colleagues who work with me earning similar or even more cannot afford to move into my area just as I could not. I just happen to live there in a house in the richest area of my city already so don't need to earn enough money to pay millions for a house.

Also my ownership of this property means I can leverage it and aquire debt (if needed) very easily at favourable rates, because the banks see that asset in my portfolio. Whereas for my black colleagues, with the same salary are unable to leverage to get the same debt at favourable rates.

Which means in South Africa white people still (mostly) live in rich areas and black people still (mostly) live in poorer areas. Now in that the laws of the country are no longer racist, black people have trickled into my neighborhood... They however are not middle class, because middle class couldn't actually afford to move into the area, they are often rich.

AskFeminists,"A lot of media has a tendency to portray bigotry as actions by individuals towards individuals, and the solution to bigotry as individuals changing their individual behaviors. 

This is a lazy copout.

Racism isn't just the kkk burning wooden crosses or neonazi chanting about Jews replacing them. Racism is when Black men receive harsher punishments than white men for the same crimes, degrading Black neighborhoods' ability to recovery economically. Racism is when doctors don't know what it looks like when a Black woman is in pain. Racism is when Donald Trump gets away with serial rape but Anthony Weiner goes to prison for sexting. Most importantly, racism is a system most of us contribute to by participating in the institutions that impose it. 

(Sexism is likewise systemic, but I'm not the best person here to go into detail about that.)

From that perspective, Ellis is right; bigotry can't be overcome with platitudes and tokenism because it requires us to recognize our role in it and work towards dismantling norms and institutions. It doesn't matter how many people see a Black protagonist in Princess and the Frog if we don't address redlining and generational poverty.

White power, and “male power” (no one really uses that one) have been historical phenomena with violent, genocidal histories. Whereas things like “black power” or “girl power” (a rather dated phrase) represent an affirmation of the value of historically marginalized groups in society. White/male power seeks to dominate others, whereas black/girl power seeks to fight back against that domination. Because recent history is worse with one, it elicits a stronger, visceral disgust towards it.

The problem I see is that shunning one, while permitting the other does leave open the potential for people to abuse it, like with redefining racism as being “prejudice plus power,” which is clearly a self serving modality to excuse black racism.

Early on the show made a point of emphasizing how how American female actors are constantly pressured into plastic surgery when one of the French women is pressured and declines.

A couple of other possible aquatic GOAT nominees:

**Penny Dean** — In 1978, Dean swam the English Channel in 7:40, the first sub-eight-hour EC crossing in history.  Her time was more than an hour faster than anyone had swum it before. (I recall her saying that she could have gone faster, but her pilot didn't believe she could go as fast as she knew she could. So, he chose a start time that, given the tides, wouldn't allow her to go faster than she did.) 

Dean held the overall English Channel record for sixteen years and the women’s record for twenty-eight. Only one person has held an English Channel solo record longer: [Matthew Webb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Webb), EC swimmer #1. She was World Professional Marathon Swimming champion by a massive margin in 1979, then went on to coach and help others make long swims. She trained Chad Hundeby, the guy who eventually broke her English Channel record.

**Cynthia Nicholas** — First woman to swim an English Channel two-way (1977). She beat the men's/overall record by nine hours and 55 minutes. Between 1978 and 1992, she was Queen of the Channel, i.e., she had swum the English Channel more than any other woman. Allison Streeter took over in 1992.

Reducing burdens created by massive inequality and setting up a system which minimizes the possibility of such inequalities to arise within the economy at all. 

Also don't under estimate Capitalism, it will happily make a profit on anti Capitalist sentiment without blinking an eye. Mass printing Che Guevara (a big anti-capitalist icon) on red t-shirts and selling them to lefty teens from rich backgrounds is something Capitalists not only would do, they do it.

Humans don't see themselves as objects, nor see animals or plants as objects. A chair is an object, a table, a book. But a cat is not an object, it's a living being, a dog is not an object. At least for most humans it's this way, as far as I perceive.

But representation alone isn't going to be the magic bullet fix of the structural legacies we have inherited from our history. Consider the one percent, if grandfather's left the billions to grand daughters there would be more representation. But the basic structure of wealth distribution would not have changed at all. 

Disney as I see it is kind of like that. They have no problem with women or black people becoming super rich and moving into the 1% (representation). But they have NO interest in changing the economic structure that set people at a disadvantage, because they are beneficiaries of that system.

AskFeminists,"I feel like you're confusing liking someone's physical feature and objectification. There's a clear distinction between the two.

Let's take your example: You look at a woman. You think she has a nice ass. You approach and meet her. In this example, a couple of things matter. First, the look. Is it a glance or a gaze? Second, the context. Is this woman a business partner you meet in a professional setting? Are you in a more comfortable setting like a party at a friend's house? Third, the encounter. How do you approach her? Are you polite? Are you in a position, maybe too close, where you could possibly make her uncomfortable?

Let's say you see her at a party and think she is sexy. In one scenario, you approach her, introduce yourself, and start a conversation in a polite manner. This is not objectification. In another scenario, you approach her, check her out from head to toe, and then say ""hey sexy"". This is objectification.

There's nothing wrong with liking someone's physical feature and being drawn to it. This is completely natural. There's nothing wrong with complimenting someone in a polite way either (obviously not like ""you have a nice ass""). What's wrong is to REDUCE people to their physical features, consciously or subconsciously.

If you respect women and see them as humans, you'll act like in scenario 1. If you subliminally think of women as objects, you'll act like in scenario 2. Regardless of which, both of these approaches are stemmed from your own perception of women. That's why how you think of and perceive women matter quite a lot.

The thing is though, while some men who have an objectifying sexist perception of women openly exhibit abusive and violent behavior, physically and sexually, many men who have the same perception of women do not act that way and they are not even aware of their own perception.

Objectification of women in media, commercials, movies, porn perpetuates the notion that women are physical and sexual objects for male pleasure and they are not real human beings with their own desires, opinions, feelings, etc. As a result, many men develop an unrealistic hypersexualized perception of women which manifests itself as emotional abuse and power play in close relationships, and it harms women's emotional well-being.

One example from my own life is my ex who loved me from the bottom of his heart, acknowledged me as a person, cared about my opinions. Yet, he used to criticize me for not being sexy 24/7, not wearing make-up, not being ""feminine enough"". According to him, I was supposed to wear sexy outfits at home, compromising my need of being comfortable in my safe space. He wasn't even aware that he was asking me to act as a sexual object for his pleasure.

AskFeminists,"&gt; I think you're confusing objectification in the sense of 'to acknowledge the physicality of a person' with the one that is meant when people discuss 'objectification' which is 'to focus on the physical attributes of a person to the exclusion of all else'. 

No, I do think of the second interpretation, but very limited in application. The example I've used to far being that I see a person in a bar or something and objectify them to essentially perform ""visual attraction analysis"" if that makes sense? I acknoledge the entirety of the person, but only consider their physicality for that moment, that is everything else is not part of my conscious thought. So indeed reducing them to nothing but physical attributes, but keeping in mind that those are only a part of what makes the person whole, as well as not letting that objectification being a salient factor of your interpretation of them as a person in the long term.

&gt;You claim to think about people's bodies without losing sight of their personhood, thoughts, feelings, etc. In which case, you are not objectifying them. You are thinking about their physical bodies, sure, but not to the exclusion of other factors. That is not what is meant by the term used in feminism (and broader) when people discuss objectification.
You seem to be on board with the idea that reducing people only to their physical traits and ignoring all else about them/stripping them of thoughts, feelings, agency, is bad.

AskFeminists,"I’m offering up just a personal theory based on my own experiences. I used to go to film school. You learn about having an artistic eye. You also learn very fast that “pretty” people make for the easiest subjects. They’re more fun to look at, in writing amd shooting, the general population tends to be more willing to form a connection with a character if they’re “attractive.” It’s all... very objectifying. At one point in my life, I might have thought “eh, so what. It’s up to the artist to decide what inspires them. If that happens to be pretty girls, so what?” 

But there’s a massive problem in all of that. One that’s kinda so deeply culturally ingrained... I dunno if we can really fix it (we should still try and always work towards it). 

All that pretty people art, all that forging connections to pretty people? It makes our whole culture think of “men and women” as those larger than life pretty people we obsess over. We don’t take people as seriously if we don’t find them as attractive. That happens to men and women, but it’s worse for women. Here’s why. When a woman is pretty we dress her down, we make her sexy. Now everyone associates pretty with sexy. There’s no appreciation for beauty without sexy anymore in a lot of ways. Now we just see women as sex objects... and we kind of always have. They’re “baby ovens that also do housework” to a lot of people. But women are just as capable as men are. They can create the same art, engineer the same machines, play the same sports, and lead the same countries. But nobody cares about that. We just want to see more pretty people. If they aren’t pretty, why should we relate to them? If they aren’t sexy what’s the point? 

As a former artist... I don’t like that about the art world. You could make a strong argument that the fault lies in commodification. Artists get snapped up by companies, companies use numbers. People buy pretty? Hey Artist! Make us some pretty!” But I think a lot of Cis male artists (myself included) fall into the trap of only showing what inspires us... and that’s usually sexy beautiful women. That’s just as sexist as a company in many ways. 

Hope all of that made some semblance of sense. Still waiting on my meds to kick in for the day. TLDR: objectification is bad because it’s dehumanizing. Dehumanizing is bad for everyone.",1615472422

AskFeminists,"&gt; ""treating something as an object""

As in to merely consider a given entity by it's physical manifestion in a specific instance/context. If I say ""they have a nice ass"" then I'm treating the person as an object/a body in the relevant context of me only being able to infer things from visual inspection from afar.
&gt;""the scope of objectification""

If I now go talk to that person then the horizon of things I know about that person grows beyond their objectification/their body. The scope of my consideration of them is now their body, but also the fact that they study law and like to collect red lawnmowers. That is, it is not longer specifically an objectification but more than that because more than their mere object/body is now relevant.
&gt;Nothing grants the right to treat someone as an object. 

The reason that I don't grope people is not based on how they are more than an object, but because I don't want them to suffer any discomfort/harm and I expect society to return the favour to me in return.
&gt;For example, if you think that I am superior to you, let's say I'm your boss, you'll behave differently to me, more respectfully and carefully, than how you would behave if I was your employee. This navigation in our behavior happens at a subconscious level but is shaped by our own perceptions.

But that is only relevent if you consider something being an object as making it ok to grope it for example, correct?

AskFeminists,"&gt;Would you like to be groped or handled as a thing? Because that's what we do with objects. 

How does touching something logically follow from that something being an object.
&gt;Object: a thing that you can see or touch but that is not usually a living animal, plant, or person.
&gt;A specific, individual, material entity, especially one that is not living or not sentient.

I looked up four dictionaries for this post and none of them mention that part lol. I conclude that the issue really is just the difference of (bodies are objects; objectifing them isn't inherently wrong) and (bodies are inherently different from objects; objectifing someone is dehumanizing them and thus wrong).
​&gt;Objectification doesn't need to be sexual, as I stated and exemplified with the Holocaust analogy. Hitler objectified non-aryans and didn't needed to sexualize them.

The point is that I don't see how the objectification is the objectionable problem.",1615468784

AskFeminists,"Thanks for your consideration for my comfort. I'm gonna be honest, I don't understand my reasons either. Hypothesis are myriads and I can't discriminate the valuable ones from the others. I just empirically know what makes me feel more comfortable.

AskFeminists,"Objectification, as we mean it, is behavior or thought pattern that opens a door that allows sexual harassment, among other things. On it's own, in a literal sense, it is benign. Much like the word, ""scientology"" implies it is the study of science, but is actually the name of a cult like religion and requires critical thinking to fully understand why it's not just ""science + study"", objectification probably, to you, sounds like it is *just* about treating someone like an object, and we're all just objects. But it means more than what it sounds like, and also requires critical thinking to fully grasp. Because we use it in a way that, and this is a social norm that MOST people agree on, that we are not using the word literally like we don't use the word scientology literally. We are talking about it as someone denying our personhood because we are an object, not a person, instead of what you seem to think it means, that we are an object AND a person.",1615495198

But to properly answer your question: As long as you don’t do it for any creepy reasons, I don’t think I would be bothered. I would literally only wonder ""why?"", so that question will likely come at you a lot. Also depends on the type of avatar of course, but I‘m going with the assumption that it isn’t anything freaky.

AskFeminists,"As you said, there are a lot of issues that warrant attention on top of what we need to do to earn money and stay mentally and physically capable to live. Like most quotes and tweets, it sounds nice in theory. I have another one by a German rock band: ""It's not your fault that the world is like it is, but it would be your fault if keeps like this"". But in practice all our capacity for certain causes is limited. Is it bad to devote only 10 minutes a day? 1h? 10% of your income? Should that better be spent on poverty reduction? Or climate change? Is it bad if I go to a climate demonstration but not on a women's march?

In the end those are only subjective things and there is no objective line between silence and action. What we can do is be aware, listen to victims and step in when violence or degrading language is used in our vicinity.

I would even go a step further and say the tweet is actively harmful: the words have no objective meaning, but they are intended both as a rallying cry for feminists and an insulting challenge for non-feminists. No one can tell me that it will convince a single person who is not yet a feminist to become one. As such, the tweet broadens the gap between groups instead of advocating for feminism.",1615493759

AskFeminists,"I have a fair amount of experience with healthcare both as a patient and a medical student. The most helpful thing in my opinion is being very clear about your concerns and, if a doctor doesn't take them seriously, escalating. 

Making a list of issues is a good idea for any appointment. If you go into it with a clear idea of what needs to be addressed, it's harder for someone to brush you aside. A good doctor will ask if you have any concerns that haven't been addressed, but because many doctors are rushed, it's something that gets skipped often. Unfortunately, the onus is often on the patient to bring up their concerns.

Another important thing to keep in mind is to not be afraid to get a second opinion, or to complain about poor quality care. Here in the UK, hospitals have a patient advice and liaison service (PALS) who you can talk to if you're dissatisfied with your care. They can help advocate for you or help you file a formal complaint. I've spoken with them twice, once after having appalling treatment by paramedics and another time when I wanted to file a complaint against my psychiatrist. They are very helpful.

Another thing, don't be afraid to change doctors. Sometimes you won't have a good rapport with a given doctor. It happens. Changing doctors is okay. They shouldn't take offense to it.",1615492014
AskFeminists,"I don't like ""either you're with us or against us"" statements, generally. It's extremely divisive, and it doesn't invite curious inquiry.

Being uninformed doesn't mean that you're maliciously refusing to take up Jamil's cause, but that's what I hear her imply in her quoted statement. I also find an element of self-righteous gatekeeping in these types of statements, too. They just turn me off entirely.",1615491983
AskFeminists,"Yeah idk maybe we mean the same thing here, maybe we don’t so I’ll just explain what I’ve seen from experience. Maybe that helps... 

I don’t really think “women” as an entire demographic is the thing to focus on. I am in a year with 70% female students. Most of them being white and from rich backgrounds. Those are not interested in changing the very thing that guaranteed them a spot. And a lot of them have a strained relationship with feminism _at best_ - plenty are happy to support anti feminist views because... privilege. 

So... what would actually help a lot more than simply having any women at all is trying to remove barriers and have more BIPOC women, more queer folks, more folks with disabilities and so on. The more diverse a student body is, the more the curriculum will have to change to acknowledge different needs (hopefully).

And the thing is women simply existing in a space really doesn’t change a lot. Especially when all the rules are still made by men and it’s a huge boys club where you are told you should be grateful to have a seat at the table at all.

I am not saying change is impossible - I am currently working to strike stuff from the curriculum at my university - but women simply signing up doesn’t do anything. There would have to be a radical overhaul of curricula and teaching practices. And I don’t see that happening with most medschools leaning white, rich and conservative where I am. It’s definitely not gonna happen by just... waiting. Not with such high barriers to even get a spot. 

I‘d like to put it out there tho that I’m literally doing feminist activism at a medical university btw. My point isn’t that change is impossible.

How things are is not immutable, and in the long term it will change. And demographic shifts and the demand for recognition will continue to push things along. None of this long term stuff requires women (in general) to be immune to anything. 

Women fought against women getting the right to vote. And the idea of women not voting was ""hard"" in how people thought... Still it changed. So your statement of how hard it is or will be, doesn't mean on the long term things will not change.",1615489292

AskFeminists,"I've recently started to have more success in getting doctors to listen to me, and it's a bunch of garbage bullshit that no one should have to do, and I only have to do it because of patriarchy and fatphobia.  BUT, that being said, I do have a couple things that I've found really really helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

For one, I've tried not to catch my doctors off guard about any of my questions.  Especially when you're dealing with chronic conditions, or weird symptoms, it's impossible for the doctor to know off the top of their head what is causing it.  And a lot of those things feasibly *could* be caused by anxiety or stress or weight or whatever, and if you catch them off guard with it, saying it's probably one of those things significantly simplifies their job, and it's really tempting to do.

So what I do is, the day before any doctor's appointment, I either use the online patient portal or the telephone to reach out to the office, and say ""Hey, I'm looking forward to my appointment with Dr. So-And-So tomorrow.  Can we put a note in my file to make sure to leave some time to talk about specific-medical-problem?  It's really been concerning me lately.""  Then, your doctor knows it's not just an offhand concern, it's really bothering you, and they'll be able to come in prepared with some more nuanced less-under-pressure thoughts for what it might be.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing that's been really helpful for me is to be completely 100% respectfully behind whatever my doctor thinks the problem is, and be willing to take whatever actions they want me to take, but to make sure that I continue asking follow up questions to be sure that my problem won't be swept under the rug.

So you say things like ""OK, I'll definitely try to lose some weight to help my knee get better.  Are there any signs I should look out for that indicate that it's getting worse or might be caused by something else?  Do you think it would be beneficial for me to see a nutritionist to aid in weight loss?  At what weight would you be concerned that my knee had some kind of problem other than weight?  If it's still like this after 6 months should I check back with you?""

Give the impression that you're 100% down with the plan of ""try your idea first"".  But make sure that that's being treated as a testable hypothesis, with a specific instruction for ""Do X.  If it doesn't work in the next 3 months, call me and we'll try something else.""

&amp;#x200B;

And if your doctor does even the bare minimum of listing to you and addressing your concerns without shuffling you out of the room, go on google and write them a GLOWING review where you specifically mention how well they listen to your concerns when so many doctors don't listen to women.  They will listen to you 12 times harder next time.",1615488469

If you stand by while people are experiencing violence, it doesn’t phase you enough to care. So yes, if you ask me, staying silent is condoning it.

I then tell the doctor about my symptoms and if they don't recommend following the diagnostic protocol- I ask them too. If a doctor refuses to take me seriously after that, I change doctors.

I have had problems with both women and men doctors-- typically though you'll have better luck being listened too at a smaller practice, rather than someone operating out of a large hospital, and with a DO rather than an MD.

AskFeminists,"When I was in my 20s, I (43f) realized that men were probably more likely to be involved in a violent incident at night.  But I was repeatedly told to “not go out alone”.  All.the.time.  By a wide range of people.

It pissed me off.  It felt like society was using some sort of mystery boogey man to control me and keep me docile and at home.  When the truth is my greatest risk of sexual assault is from men I have some sort of relationship with.

So I started going out alone.  Walking around town late at night.  Traveling. Hiking. You name it, if I want to do it, I will do am honest risk assessment and go do it .  (I am aware that there are risks to solo activities, and sometimes the reward is not worth the risk)

After 20 years and multiple cities in North America and Europe: 1 stranger put his arm around me; another 2 masturbated in front of me.  But guys I know have committed sexual assault, sexual coercion, unwanted physical contact... various things.  at the end, I feel safer among strangers out in the open where I can separate myself than in an enclosed space with casual acquaintances.",1615480960
AskFeminists,"Ever been mugged? Because I have, twice. The second time they didn't even ask for anything. They just knocked me down and beat the living shit out of me before even trying to take anything. I was off work for two months.

Know what literally everyone - the cops, the doctors, my friends, my family, my wife - said to me constantly? ""What were you thinking walking alone that late? How drunk were you? Well, what did you *expect?*""

The idea that no one blames men for their own victimization is a complete myth. The experience is absolutely not unique to women.",1615480671
AskFeminists,"I think it's important to remember that victims of violent crimes that were reported to the police, of both genders, are a very small minority of the population.  It's a very small number of people who are like ""this happened to me, or I saw it happened to someone else, and now I am scared.""  That's not the primary driver for feelings of safety or lack of safety.

The primary driver for people's feelings of lack of safety are their actual experiences.  And I think that women are overwhelmingly more likely than men to encounter non-violent threats outside the home unrelated to their own behavior.  If someone catcalls you, if someone follows you home but doesn't actually hurt you, if someone whispers something sexual in your ear on a train, often even if you're groped in passing.  Those things almost never get reported to police, and especially they don't count as ""violent crimes"".  And most women have had an experience with something like that in places that most people would consider ""safe"".  They've had a male stranger follow them or make uncomfortable advances towards them in a coffee shop, on a crowded train, in a well-lit bar, in the supermarket, at the gym, walking down a busy main road in broad daylight.  These smaller scary ways that men victimize women happen in places that are supposed to be safe and they happen to almost all women at some point in their lives.

In my experience, men and women both feel fear when parking in a dark alleyway far from the bar, when walking alone in the woods, when passing a shady looking character on the street.  But I think that women more than men are frequently reminded that even places that are normal and safe can be very dangerous to women.  That guy who followed you in the mall could follow you into the parking garage and murder you, and even if he didn't, you always know that he could have.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, a nonzero percentage of the male number can be attributed to perpetrators of violence being more likely to be victims of violence, and a majority of perpetrators of violence are male.  So, like, if 6 dudes start fighting eachother in a bar with no women in it, that's 6 men who are victims of a violent assault.  I think in general non-perpetrator men are still more at risk for violence outside the home, but it does inflate those numbers a little.",1615480643

You should compare pure numbers of men and women going outside, and how they are assaulted and harassed.

AskFeminists,"You are correct. Women are thought they should be on tv because of how pretty they are. That is first. Acting ability comes second. And there are so many guys on tv that if you met them on the street you would never look at them twice, much less want them to look at you. Vince Vaughn comes to mind. Not exactly attractive, overweight, looks like your typical loser dude on the sofa, and he doesn't even act that well. Everything I've seen him in is just about the same char. But they pair him up with Jennifer Aniston who can act, has a slim body, and is gorgeous. He should be paired up with Rosanne. 2 people on the same attractiveness side, not ugly, but not Jennifer Aniston.   But there are a lot of those pairings.

It's also harder to relate to women onscreen if somewhere in the back of your mind your thinking they are perfect, it makes it a little harder to sympathize.

One of my favorite shows is on BBC The Split. Nicola Walker plays a lawyer. She is brilliant. I always feel lucky to be able to watch it with her, because she  would never be allowed on us tv. She doesn't look like a supermodel, and she make me  think of how many other actresses that would make a show a standout because of their acting ability., but aren't allowed because their attractiveness level is only that of Vaughn.

AskFeminists,"I understand where the confusion comes from especially because blanket statements like, ""if you're not with us by definition you're against us"" are not very open minded.

I think what she means, though, is if, as a man, you talk about how women deserve rights, but when women accuse others of rape, assault, when they march for rights, if no men step up to speak in support, they're not really doing much.

They can say all they want about women's rights, but how many men have stepped up in support of Evan Rachel Wood, of Rose McGowan, of all the women who scream that they've suffered violence? It's always the women. The men stand back like they're just letting women do their thing.

But they have to raise their voice too. Call out men who abuse. You don't need to witness it to interrupt the violence. Simply believe women fervently and use your privileged cishetero platform to call out the violence and demand justice. Like, male celebs need to be at MeToo marches and events, at TimesUp events.

If Charisma comes out to denounce the monster Whedon, David Boreanaz and Nicholas Brendon need to do more than say, oh, that's so sad, I'm sorry. They should demand they deplatform Whedon. Brendon's, oh he's my friend, is bullshit. Help women fight the violence or admit you're just pretending to believe women.

They can't have their cake and eat it too. Men are so bro-ey in that. They respect other men so hard, that they can't respect women more and support them 100000000% and yell it from the rooftops.

The time has come and gone for women to be apologetic of men as bystanders. They either do it, or they don't.

Notice how quick women are to defend and believe women they've never met. Men don't do that. They only give their two cents when it's a friend. If that. I wanna hear Hugh Jackman, Martin Scorsese, Chris Pine. I want all these men with large platforms to come out and say, I believe her and I support her.

They have nothing to lose. They're men. The most privileged bunch. But they don't. It becomes a, oh, no comment, I don't know the story. The same turning of heads when they see a drunk guy at a bar force himself on a woman or yell at his girlfriend. It's like there's a written code to be loyal to each other.

But I personally feel much safer around women, so not everyone will weigh the same to that point as I do. And of course, personal experiences.

See the reason I said I realized I feel safer watching a stream is that I would feel like I would get a better glimpse into the person playing, and by that find safety in knowing the person‘s motivations to the degree that is perceivable over it in the first place. Commentary adds a lot to that.

I don't think that's a fair argument on your end to make.

Also as I explained people may have different resources. Sure, if you can afford to help someone in distress, you should 100% do it.

But for many people it may not be an option. Is it lack of character that a 5'1"" guy doesn't want to intervene catcalling from a group of drunk and possibly aggressive guys?

AskFeminists,"How do you actively end violence other than not participating or condoning it,I don't see how society as a whole will end violence.The world is violent in genera.I even read a study that claimed the human body is designed for violence.

Violence is caused by so many factors its virtually impossible to end.That would also mean ending mental illness and basic human nature,in fact nature is violent even plants are violent.

We can preach don't hit women until our throats bleed but that won't stop every psychopath from doing it.Furthermore violence can be circumstantial a perfectly nice guy and general may strike a woman in a blind rage or because he's drunk.

In the western world violence in general against anyone is shunned but it still happens and will probably always happen as sure as water is wet.This same theory applies to ""teach men not to rape""Every man knows he shouldn't  rape no one needs to be taught that.Things that you don't want done to you people know they shouldn't do to others.

The outrage over the Sarah Everard situation is that she did everything right. She did all she could to protect herself and was still murdered. It isn't that no women should do what they can to avoid danger, it's that most women already do what they can, and are still killed.

The issue is, women have and are still being made to change what they do to accomodate for the actions of murderers and rapists. Like when the yorkshire ripper was about and women were put under a curfew. Would it not have made more sense to put men under a curfew since then any men out and about could be classed as suspects? Obviousĺy it's not an identical situation, but you get my point.

Everyday we are passing through constant stream of news that never stop to report about injustices around the world. Every case is deserving full public attention, but not everyone has ability or time to provide it.

It is inevitable that there would be a need to prioritize some events over others, and I don't know any other method to do so other than leaving it on our own personnel choice. Nobody should decide for anyone what problems in society are more important.

AskFeminists,"I wonder in which way you should expect men individually to step in on such occasions. I hope we can have a meaningful discussion on this so let me elaborate.

Let me first start by the premise of abolishing toxic gender roles. One of which would be the male as the strong protector of the weak female. Women are strong and need no men to protect them. So there is no obligation to stop violence because they are men.

On the other hand, men might also face consequences if they intervene in certain violent situations. These consequences may be social or physical. Which highly depends on the social area the violence is happening.

For example:

A man has a job he needs for his survival. He sees his boss molest one of his female colleagues.
And while the colleague is afraid to stop her boss because she might lose her job, you could say the same about the man bearing witness to the horrible behavior.

A man in the Disco watching someone grab a women's butt. This is obviously and clearly sexual violence. While the women might be afraid to defend herself due to clear physical threat, the man witnessing can feel the same way. Intervention might lead to himself ending up in the hospital for someone he doesn't even know.

In conclusion in certain situation men might not have the resources to actively intervene a violent situation. May it be financially, socially or physically.

Expecting those men to risk their health, financial stability or social standing in some cases for someone they don't know may be a lot to ask.

This said if you have the resources to intervene a case of violence, you should obviously do it. No matter the attacker or victim of this violence. But I think it's important to have a bit of nuance here.",1615499439

The person who works behind the scenes may not be comfortable protesting in a crowd. The person that trys to educate on an individual basis because they connect better that way may not have things posted on social media. And the movement leader from a year ago may now be battling cancer and no longer has the energy to devote to a cause.

AskFeminists,"&gt;I know I've went a little off-topic so I hope it's still within this subreddit's scope, but would you say that my neutrality has made me complicit in anti-Asian racism and other social justice movements that I haven't engaged as much in?

Are you taking a position of neutrality on this issue though? Is it your position that you don't have an opinion-- you don't feel one way or the other about it-- and if you were confronted by someone who did have a racist opinion about Asian's and COVID would you agree with them to avoid conflict? What would your response be to someone impacted by the issue directly asking for your help? Would you decline and say, ""I don't have an opinion and I prefer to be neutral""? Because that's different than having an opinion but not having had an occasion to become involved in an effort for advocacy.

I think what's also okay, and different-- is prioritizing issues on the basis of your capacity to engage and be meaningfully knowledgeable and supportive-- not everyone can be involved in every issue. I have tended to prioritize feminism (because I'm a woman) and anti-racism (because I'm a white person living in a majority black city)-- other issues I am active in have a priority order after those two based on my limited human ability to think and feel and be fully present-- and that kind of prioritization isn't what Jamil, or others who use this kind of language, is talking about.

AskFeminists,"I am a female physician working in the ER. I think something we, as physicians, aren’t always good at is reconciling patient priorities with our priorities. I have a few things to recommend to patients to help reframe the “we are a team” approach to their own symptoms. Spoiler alert - the final step is to find a new GP if you still aren’t feeling listened to. 

First off, book an appointment to specifically address the symptoms that aren’t being attended to. Don’t try to tag them onto an appointment about your other health issues. The latter may result in you being blown off, as time often limits most GP appointments to ten minutes. If your GP is really focused on your heart health, they may not have time to address say, more chronic symptoms such as fatigue or pain or weight loss, etc. 

Be upfront with specific concerns in that appointment, don’t leave them to the end. Usually we open with an open question like “what brings you in today?” Reply with something like “I was hoping to ask some questions related to my &lt;symptom&gt;, as I feel as though I don’t fully understand my management plan for it.” 

If you have something in particular you are worried about, be upfront about that too. “Doctor, I keep getting frightened that this pain may be cancer. Is that something you are concerned about too, or have we ruled that out already?” If we haven’t ruled that out “Would we be able to do some tests for that for peace of mind, or can you explain to me why that isn’t on your list of possibilities?”

The answer to “can I get more tests” may still be “no” depending on what your concern or question is. For example, if you are requesting full body MRI to rule out every possible cause of cancer, that isn’t a feasible workup. But if you’re having pelvic pain or bleeding (I saw in your comment the concern was the reproductive system), and wonder if there could be a problem there, a pelvic ultrasound or endometrial biopsy is a reasonable and easy thing to arrange for. 

As someone else suggested, if your management plan still seems like you’re being blown off, you have a few options. First, you can say something like “okay, so the best step now is to give it some more time to see if it settles. It has already been a problem for &lt;days/weeks/months/whatever&gt;. When should I come back in if it fails to settle down, to go forward with the next step? What is the next step?”

You can also ask for a referral “If it doesn’t settle down, would I be able to discuss this further with a specialist? If there’s a long waitlist, could we put that referral in today, so the follow-up is in place?”

If all else fails, “Would I be able to talk about this with one of the other Doctors in your practice, to get a second opinion? I’m really worried about it.”

And finally, you can “fire” your doctor and call around for a new one if you’re still being blown off. 

I don’t recommend exaggerating your symptoms, as someone else here commented. If symptoms are exaggerated (so a chronic symptom is being stated as severe, or more acute, or in a larger distribution), it can change the differential diagnosis. So you may end up with a work up that is inappropriate for your presenting complaint. 

Honesty is the best policy. Sometimes it does take several visits and a step-wise approach to get a diagnosis, and this is normal and reasonable. 

Consider attending the appointment with your mom if she is having trouble explaining these things or isn’t being listened to. If all else fails, find a new provider. Attending medical school doesn’t make us all good people or infallible, and sometimes you just have a bad egg as a PCP.",1615498317

AskFeminists,"&gt; Anarchist here. I strongly oppose the idea of more women billionaires, more women cops, etc. The existence of these groups is fundamentally oppressive in my worldview and I would not devote any time to making it happen. 

I disagree. Even though I like the idea of dismantling those systems, it's going to take a huge fucking amount of time dismantle them. It's like saying 'why should we care about trans rights? We should focus on dismantling gender itself'. It's not going away for a good few centuries for sure. Why should women suffer with this disparity while men climb up? 

&gt; But I don't think that a woman politician is inherently more progressive than a man who is a politician. 

Being progressive is not the only reason to have more women. Women tend to know more about how it is to live life as a woman than a man. So, when women are there at the top and have the power to change things, they will know how to make lives better for women and will be able to make that happen. It's the same reason we need to uplift minority groups  too. A black person in power will have lived the experience of being black and so they would know how to make lives better for black people.",1615545151

AskFeminists,Yes,1615533090
AskFeminists,I agree with what you're saying. I think a scary thought is that perhaps a big reason why public violence is so low for women is because they're not in public and not in the way of opportunistic violence as much as men are.,1615532992
AskFeminists,"I do think there are good points made here, and many elements of modern culture that teach women and girls that they should be afraid to exist publicly in the world but tolerant of and obedient to authority figures and family members *are* rooted in sexist traditions, often with a splash of racism and victim-blaming for good measure. 

That said, I'd be hesitaant come to the conclusion that it's *all* an overblown phenomenon. For instance, there are plenty of ways women can be made to feel uniquely uncomfortable alone in public spaces that might fall short of actually constituting violent crime, but still contribute to a general feeling of hostility or danger that can leave a lasting impression. 

Also, not all crime is necessarily cut from the same cloth: even if men are more likely than women to be the victims of violent crime in general, women could still be more likely to be the victim of *gendered* violence -- that is, crime committed not out of opportunism but specifically on the basis of the victim's sex, with rape and sexual assault being some obvious examples.

AskFeminists,"&gt; Let me first start by the premise of abolishing toxic gender roles. One of which would be the male as the strong protector of the weak female. Women are strong and need no men to protect them. So there is no obligation to stop violence because they are men.  
  
we're not saying men need to physically stop violence against women. we're talking about, say if you have a friend who seems to make misogynistic jokes, then maybe tell him it isnt cool. or if a guy seems to be dismissing women's claims of sexual assault for no reason. tell him that's wrong too.  
  
&gt; A man has a job he needs for his survival. He sees his boss molest one of his female colleagues. And while the colleague is afraid to stop her boss because she might lose her job, you could say the same about the man bearing witness to the horrible 
behavior.  
     
uhm if he like literally walks in on him molesting a subordinate I think if he just shouts out ""what the fuck are you doing"" and then ya know, tells people what happened with corroboration, then that's enough, and probably won't get him fired.  
    
&gt; A man in the Disco watching someone grab a women's butt. This is obviously and clearly sexual violence. While the women might be afraid to defend herself due to clear physical threat, the man witnessing can feel the same way. Intervention might lead to himself ending up in the hospital for someone he doesn't even know.    

again, men don't need to literally beat up these people. if you really want to help in a situation you can just place yourself in between the two, maybe stop the guy from being able to get to the woman.",1615525074

AskFeminists,"I think it depends where the push comes from. I work in a technical job and I spend a lot of time advocating to make things more equitable and to increase the share of engineers who are women &amp; from under-represented backgrounds because I want to see people get paid. From my perspective this is both the best I can do, and it's a systemic effort because I'm seeking to expand equity within a closed system (my workplace/industry), and it maximizes what little power I do have.

But when the government tells these same groups ""learn to code"" it hits different because it puts the onus of overcoming/mitigating systemic oppression onto those groups. The government has the power and the money to make many changes that would increase equity for oppressed groups, so the ""learn to code"" push there feels like a neoliberal diversion. 

I see nuance in the leadership question. No doubt, increasing the diversity of perspectives and breaking up the homogeneous ranks of highly educated wealthy white men can have a beneficial impact. But too often we just take a highly educated wealthy white woman with the same politics and behaviors. 

When we explicitly don't do that - when we increase leadership diversity in race, class, national origin, education level, and other areas, and we do it with a lot of people instead or one or two token roles, then we start to see transformative change.",1615524532

As for public office... public office is a tool. Electoralism is one theory of change, and even many leftist projects ultimately appeal to elected officials on some level -- for instance, if they are using disruption to convince a public official to do the right thing on an issue, the response to it will still depend on that official. So I am not opposed to being thoughtful about electoral politics. But I don't think that a woman politician is inherently more progressive than a man who is a politician. If Sarah Palin and Bernie Sanders were both running for office, I would neither shun Sanders because he is a man, nor vote for Palin because she is a woman. And, from an anarchist perspective, spending massive amounts of energy on something like, I don't know, infiltrating the DNC and implementing a bunch of policies making political office more accessible for women is not the most valuable use of time, although I would support friends and comrades doing that work.",1615524156

No, if they allow trans women too in those slots. If they don't, it's trans exclusive. That would depend on the gym.

Not necessary since there aren't many women who explicitly stare at or harass men. It's not a systemic problem that few men may get harassed. 

&gt; Should other groups e.g. races, LGBT etc. also get their own time slots? 

This solves an issue specific to gender. So, race, LGBTQ people, etc don't have to get another separate slot. If they too faced issues in gym because of belonging to a certain race or orientation, there should be separate slots. But since that's not the case, it's not necessary.",1615557612
AskFeminists,"How I feel about this:

I’m deeply sad that it’s necessary, but so appreciate the option. Like many women, I’ve been harassed at the gym by men. A lot. As a result, I’m not very comfortable working out around men. I’m glad I have an option for working out that allows me to avoid this situation altogether.

The entire issue could be better mitigated if gyms would just protect their clientele from harassment, but they generally choose not to do so. And honestly, a man simply staring and watching my every move ruins my workouts because it’s creepy and weird AF, but no normal gym will kick them out for it. 

I visit less traditional workout venues now that are usually owned and operated by women or queer people or POC. When that shit is clearly and openly unacceptable, it doesn’t really happen. I like being able to fit a safe and comfortable workout into my schedule, instead of building my whole schedule around the one hour I can have a safe and comfortable workout.

To answer your questions:

1) Not necessarily, especially since trans women are included and are typically the group most likely to experience violence or harassment. (Also, trans men were invited to participate in the women’s hour at my old gym, which is a great option for another group that may experience violence in that setting). 
2) No, because cis men don’t experience violence or harassment in gym settings related to their gender identity. 
3) Not necessarily, because there isn’t really a universal experience of harassment or violence based on race that is specific to a gym setting. LGBTQ+ people",1615557593

Let's start by looking at what we can uncontroversially agree on: Lorenz made an inaccurate statement and was called out on it. Then, in response, she said:

&gt;""Thanks for clarifying (...) I hope you can understand how some people in the room felt hearing it""

I'll be honest: initially, I read this unsympathetically. But then I stopped to think about what an ""ideal"" response would be. Maybe you have a better one, but all I could think of is, ""Maybe she could say 'I'm sorry'?"" That's expecting a *personal*, *emotional* intervention from a woman that we likely wouldn't expect from a male reporter. Because to me, her response seems par for the course in terms of journalistic editing conventions. In the context of an article, usually it will just say something like ""Update: An earlier version of this article erroneously claimed that John Doe murdered ten thousand people. John Doe is a surgeon who saved ten thousand people"" in tiny print at the bottom. She said that someone used the r word when they didn't, then acknowledged and thanked the person who corrected her. So I'd be interested in hearing how you would frame an ideal correction here, in light of existing journalistic conventions. You mentioned Jim Acosta; how would he handle this?

But let's assume for a minute that she got it unequivocally wrong and that we agree that her response not only could have been better, but was actively dodging responsibility. Even so, that there was a prolonged harassment campaign in response to this honestly has Sarkeesian/gamergate vibes.

The claim of this campaign is ostensibly ""accountability."" Look, I've facilitated accountability processes before. Trust me when I say that harassment is not conducive to self-accountability. (Sometimes self-accountability isn't the goal, but if self-accountability is the goal, harassment is not an effective tactic.) This is because, when a person is harassed, they often adopt self-protective measures. This can look like over-apologizing or over-responsibilizing (""I'm so, so incredibly sorry... please forgive me, I'm so sorry, really, I am"") or it can look like complete denial of any responsibility because you're aware that the attacks on you are unfair (even if the criticisms are not). Actual self-accountability is only possible when you have the room to stop, breathe, and think through what happened, analyzing what caused it. This is not an option when you are the target of a harassment campaign. It's not wrong to *want* someone to own up to having messed up, but if you *expect* that of someone who is subject of a harassment campaign, you're going to be disappointed.

&gt;does anybody else view her support for ending the harassment of women online as primarily a means to absolve her of her own journalistic errors?

Based on what you've posted here, no. I think she experienced widespread harassment from thousands of people and experienced it as traumatic. Nothing in this post suggests to me that her posting this was out of some sort of cunning calculation.

&gt;Is it not likely that a male journalists would receive a comparable level of vitriol? A good example of this is Jim Acosta, even when confronted with absurd accusations he is an individual who always responds to critics with the underlying subtext that the most important thing for him, as a journalist, is his journalistic integrity. Is our political discourse not polarized to the extent that which gender is far less important than ""team""?

I certainly question whether a Fox News anchor would have encouraged people to go after a man, and whether they would have done so. Also, I know that when people go after oppressed groups on the internet, the *way* they do so is often very different. My male friends of color have been threatened with lynching, deportation, violence against their families, etc; my white friends have not. My friends who are women or read as women have been threatened with rape, often described in detail as a play-by-play.

&gt;Are the swaths of men (and women) who come to the defense of Lorenz not indicative of their desire to infantilize her and absolve her of her own mistakes? Is it wrong to expect a certain level of tolerance of online spam from a journalist reporting on heated topics, even if that journalist is a woman?

You're describing a targeted harassment campaign, not ""online spam.""",1615555605

AskFeminists,"&gt;  If I lose my job nobody is going to withhold my unemployment insurance because I don‘t want to be a coal miner

Several questions:

1)Are you saying that in Germany you can continue to receive unemployment benefits even if you don't take other job offers, as long as those are not in your field of work?

2)Interesting you would mention coal mining. Should this imply that sex work carries significant health risks, like coal mining? Or what is the point of this?

3)The larger question remains, what of other countries where if you refuse existing job offers, you lose employment benefits?

&gt;You are assuming that only women can be „expected“ to be sex workers under this model. Sex work is work, for everyone who wants to do it.

I was driving a point home. Sure, my question can cover men and other genders, if need be.

&gt;Consent cannot be commoditised, and in fact sex work is not a commodity. 

You are not replying in good faith. ""Commodification of sexual consent"" is in fact used in such discussions. Should I help you with a google query? ;)

&gt;A person forced into sex work is in fact being commoditised, objectified

Can we also agree that a person is forced into sex work, if the reason for doing so is poverty? (That is, one can be forced into sex work not just by other persons, but by economic circumstances/economic duress).

&gt;Part of the problem of treating sex work as its own special thing (rather than work) is that it opens many doors for exploitation. I have the right as a professional to deny service to a company I dislike, because I have legal protections from basic forms of workplace lock-in that many sex workers do not. This is also the case for most trafficked workers in e.g. sweatshops.

I am struggling to make sense of what you are trying to say. Should we or should we not treat sex work as normal form of work (or should it be its own special thing)? Your argument is all over the place in that paragraph.",1615554203

AskFeminists,"If men make it less socially acceptable for other men to attack women by saying something when they notice the other men around them being misogynistic, it will be less socially acceptable for men to be violent towards women. It's a very simple concept. 

It's work that men need to do because it just doesn't penetrate a lot of the time when women are saying it. The men who are violent towards us often don't care what we think (you see because they don't respect us, hence the violence). If other men let it happen, it's pretty clear that they don't respect us enough to stop it. That signals to the person who will be violent that its okay to disrespect women because no one will do anything about it regardless of whether it's right.  People might tend to be violent but they're going to weigh whether they can get away with it and choose the path of least resistance. So, it is societal because it is behaviour that is ignored and sometimes rewarded by our society and that enables those that would be violent.

AskFeminists," 

&gt;Because feminist have equated femininty with being weak and conforming to the standards men set for women.

Feminists haven't done this, the patriarchy has. It in a lot of instances arbitrarily set up gender roles which give traits to people who are ""born"" female and male based on their genitalia. The patriarchy itself sets up the dynamic of men and masculinity being superior to women and femininity. To be clear, the patriarchy is a gendered hierarchy that places men above women, but it isn't a stand-in for ""men"" as a group. The patriarchy and enforced gender roles says that there is a right and a wrong way to be a man or woman. Feminists are the ones pointing out the fact that this is wrong and harmful to men and women. 

&gt;Wearing a dress,heals and makeup is seen as catering to men.

Feminists generally do not care about what women choose to do for themselves in regards to feminine presentation.

AskFeminists,"Hey, I think I edited while you were replying. (I try not to overedit, but it's earlier here and I'm still a little groggy.) This is what I added:

&gt;ETA: To be clear, if someone is being sexist or otherwise oppressive against a woman billionaire or a woman cop, I would object. Like if someone says a woman cop should be sexually assaulted, that's absolutely not okay and I'd have words with them. But that's very, very different from pushing for more women cops or more women billionaires.

I also added this:

&gt; (If there were sexist laws against it, I might feel differently, but like... I am never going to be part of the billionaire class, and I will probably never even own a home. Not only do I not have the *power* to influence corporate culture at the level of the billionaire class, not only is it completely foreign to me, I'm also fundamentally uninterested in supporting anyone in their goal to steal more food from people's mouths.)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Not all people with STEM careers or in politics become billionaires anyways, in fact, most people don't. So why shouldn't we push for women to be in STEM or other higher earning fields?

Oh, perhaps this is the point of confusion: I was explicitly *not* talking about STEM or politicians here. I was introducing a situation in which I would probably agree with OP's interlocutor, as a way of explaining why I *don't* agree on other things and articulating the places where I see more nuance.

&gt;As for cops, I'm not educated enough on the topic to know why it's oppressive. I don't live in US but I just thought you guys wanted to defund the police because of bigotry in the system, but not the system itself.

I'd say that what you've described is the dominant view. My feeling, which is the dominant *anarchist* perspective on this issue, is that 1. the police and prison system is deeply and irredeemably tied to white supremacy. (The thirteenth amendment to the US constitution, which ostensibly abolished slavery, reads, ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, ***except as a punishment for crime*** whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."") 2. Even if policing and prisons weren't irredeemably racist, they are oppressive systems in and of themselves.",1615551710

AskFeminists,"&gt;But you can understand why women on the left might find people like AOC reaching positions of power empowering to women right? You don't consider that a lib thing, do you?

Like I said, I think it's great to have politicians in office who are more on our side than others. Some of my friends don't vote, but I do. AOC isn't perfect, but there are a lot of things I really like about her. When we start to talk about empowerment, I notice that the things I find empowering about AOC's victory are not necessarily about her being a woman or being Latina, though as a woman-aligned person whose dad is Latino those make me feel more warmly toward her. For me it has more to do with her coalitional grassroots approach to politics. But yeah, I wouldn't call it a lib thing. To me the lib thing is celebrating a woman being in a position of power *simply because she's a woman*, with no consideration for whether she's a feminist or not, or whether she's oppressive or not. I think when most people are celebrate AOC, they're celebrating that she's a woman, but they wouldn't be celebrating if she were a TERF or anti-abortion or whatever else. So I support that celebration.

&gt;And are you against people trying to encourage women to go into STEM feilds? I don't see how that has negative effects.

Not against it. There are a lot of conversations happening about military funding for STEM, so it might be that that's where your acquaintance was coming from. I'm sympathetic to the perspective that the push towards STEM as the only viable option is related to what businesses and the military find valuable (and other problems in academia), but I don't think STEM is fundamentally bad.

&gt;Also, did you notice that Asami from Legend Of Korra is an embodiment of everything you oppose about liberal feminism?

Yeah, I sounded a bit silly, what I meant was that the commentators seemed to speak as if the only reason people would watch football is if it's high-level enough. It's like saying people would only want to watch fighting matches to see who would objective win and so only watch heavyweight and superheavyweight fights, but  in reality we know that people are just as interested if not more interested in fights of lower weight classes including interest in women's fights. All you need to do is not seperate out women or different weight classes  or different events

'*""I am strongly against having men's section and women's section in sports. I think there should be just 'Open' section and 'Women's' section, no need to exclude women to give them they're own space. Are you scared that some women might win against too many men? ""*

I always used to be against that idea on the basis that it could be unfair on men who felt obliged to hold back a bit when up against women. On reflection that is a very very poor reason.'

'If anything I fear that the reverse is actually the problem - having an open football league, and then having to explain that women can participate it's just that in the 15 years since the rule came in no woman has made the grade is unlikely to do much for women's sport. Neither woudl it benefit women's sport if if was just like now, only with the handful of superstars missing because they are playing in a non-elite men's league.

Am I laying it on a bit think? Maybe. But what about 4x100 m relay? Let's have a mixed team in the Olympics... women just aren't gonna make the cut. And whilst football is about skill to a very large extent it is also all about physicality. Take the english PL. Excluding goalkeepers the players are pretty much all 17 to 37, with the vast majority of those between about 21 and 32. A 38 year old man who was - at his peak - one of the fittest and best players in the league has very little chance of being able to compete physically any more. How is a 5'5"" woman who runs 5-10% slower than a man gonna have a chance? Their skill levels would have to be through the roof, which is not realistic and may still not be enough. When my team play - I've just checked - we can put out a side which includes five tall players who can go forward to attack the ball from corners. Those five players average 1.90m or 6'3""... ok, so normally only four of them are playing, but I've just googled and Wendie Renard at 6'1"" was the tallest player at the 2019 world cup. I'm speculating here, but I'd guess that if you were to put together a women's team including all the tallest women's players who play international football they'd risk losing to my favourite men's team simply on the basis of being out-jumped at set pieces, even if they matched my team in every other way.

It would be fascinating to see those women who could compete, and at what level. But I fear it would be an exception that proves the rule that women can't match the men physically, rather than an inspiration to other women.

And this is nothing to feel bad about... a lightweight male boxer gets on with being the best at his size, he doesn't worry that if he were in a bar fight with a heavyweight he'd be dead in 15 seconds.'

I thought of the idea that in MMA that Women in the same weight class as men could fight with little problem if:

1: On the day before the fight, the woman would have to weigh in heavier (likely the man would try to weigh in near the bottom of the weight class while the woman would try to weigh in near the top of the weight class.

2: Remove the illegality of some moves for the woman, for example she can't use eye gouges but *can* hit in the below the belt area and hit a floored opponent. This may sound uncivillised but actually this is necessary so that the man doesn't take it easy on the woman. If he felt his balls were at risk in a way hers weren't he wouldn't feel the need to go easy.

AskFeminists,"&gt;Why should women suffer with this disparity while men climb up?

I named billionaires and cops for a reason -- these are deeply, deeply oppressive things. Not being able to exploit and oppress people isn't a form of suffering. As for it taking a huge amount of time to dismantle them, there have been tremendous strides in dismantling the police system in the United States in the past year. I'm not going to work on reforming the police system to make it more friendly towards women while striving to tear it down. That just doesn't make any sense.

&gt;Being progressive is not the only reason to have more women. Women tend to know more about how it is to live life as a woman than a man. So, when women are there at the top and have the power to change things, they will know how to make lives better for women and will be able to make that happen. It's the same reason why we need to uplift minority groups too. A black person in power will have lived the experience of being black and so they would know how to make lives better for black people.

I think there are reasons to have more *progressive* women politicians. But I don't agree that it's better to have a woman in a position of power than a man even if she's more conservative. Women politicians have not always historically done more for women. An anti-choice politician who happens to be a woman is not a feminist victory.

AskFeminists,"Virtually all of the assumptions behind this post are horrifically wrong.

Here‘s a breakdown:
- Unemployment benefits are a safety net and are given when you can‘t find employment in your branch. In Germany, for example, they are paired with actively helping you find employment in your branch. If I lose my job nobody is going to withhold my unemployment insurance (that I pay for out of my income) because I don‘t want to be a coal miner, let alone a sex worker (which is legal here)
- You are assuming that only women can be „expected“ to be sex workers under this model. Sex work is work, for everyone who wants to do it.
- Consent cannot be commoditised, and in fact sex work is not a commodity. It‘s not oil or gold, you‘re not selling pussy futures on the NYSE. It‘s a service that you offer 1-1 (or more) and can refuse to offer. Just like any other professional doesn‘t sell „hours“ and get called up and forced to do those hours to whoever buys them. I can refuse to work for oil companies (and I do), so can sex workers (in a context where they are treated like professionals and not a commodity) refuse to work with a client they don‘t like of feel safe with.

Of course, sex work and sexual exploitation are not the same thing. A person willfully engaging in prostitution or any other form of sex work is a professional providing a service. A person forced into sex work is in fact being commoditised, objectified, so I could imagine this is closer to what you mean by commoditising consent (it‘s not, because there‘s no consent in such a scenario).

Part of the problem of treating sex work as its own special thing (rather than work) is that it opens many doors for exploitation. I have the right as a professional to deny service to a company I dislike, because I have legal protections from basic forms of workplace lock-in that many sex workers do not. This is also the case for most trafficked workers in e.g. sweatshops.

I would not engage in or consume sex work, because it‘s not up my alley. But it someone wants to fuck for a living they should have the same rights I do.

AskFeminists,"To me, I think the important thing is to just keep in mind the way discussing the beauty of women encourages men to act and makes women feel.

Like, imagine you gave an hour long talk about a subject you're very knowledgeable in, posted it online, and every single comment was from someone saying you were really hot, you were really ugly, or that they liked your shirt or something.  No one had anything to say about Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Networks or whatever you presented.  They just wanted to talk about your body.  Imagine that someone bigger than you and scarrier told you you were beautiful and then tried to follow you home.Imagine how that might make you feel in other situations when others discussed your physical appearance.

And with that understanding in mind, think about how you discuss women's bodies.  So, like ""Wow, I love polevaulting, the athletes are so graceful"" is a thing you could say that is unlikely to devalue anybody, but saying it about a specific female athlete might be a situation where you'd want to be careful to not make her uncomfortable, or encourage others to talk about her body.",1615563684

AskFeminists,"So, this is kind of a complicated question.  The behavior you're describing isn't what I'd call ""male gaze"".  Male gaze means that a piece of media was produced presenting women in a way to cater to male sexuality.

The term I'd give to your behavior is ""sexualization"".  A woman was going about her day, answering a question about her religion.  She wasn't doing a makeup tutorial, or showing off a new outfit, or something else to indicate that she was soliciting your opinion on her physical appearance.  You didn't have anything to say about what her opinion was, you had to make it about how she looks and whether you do or don't find her attractive.  And yeah, that kind of attitude can be a *result* of male gaze in the media.  When you're raised with imagery that makes you feel like female bodies exist for your view, it can result in men reducing women to their appearance, and that's bad because it means that women are reduced to their bodies.  Beautiful women are treated as if their only value is in their bodies, and ugly women are treated as if they have no value whatsoever.

So what you do about it is absolutely you keep it to yourself about how attractive or unattractive you think a stranger is unless they're asking for your opinion.  And when you create media, you don't portray any person specifically for the sexual satisfaction of the audience unless you're producing literal pornography.  Media should be about telling the story of the characters you're presenting, or communicating the ideas you're trying to communicate.",1615561046
AskFeminists,"Your friend is incorrect, male gaze is an academic term that refers to film and media first and foremost. What you did might be objectification. 

And as for « what’s wrong with it » from a feminist perspective you already got a reply - reinforces the idea of women being sexual objects. But it’s also wrong from artistic perspective if it doesn’t add anything to the story or character, and especially if it contradicts story or character. Example of it done correctly, when it could easily be ruined in hands of 99/100 directors: Mad Max Fury Road. When Max first sees the wives cleaning themselves, most male directors would film it as « Angelina Jolie in a shower » type of thing. You know what I’m talking about. Instead, he filmed it in a way that makes sense - Max lusts for water, not women. Women are framed neutrally, in wide and medium shots, without camera lingering on their attractive bodies. 

Example where it’s done poorly - almost every fucking movie. Basically you can film ass and tits, but only if it makes sense. And it doesn’t makes sense in most cases. I love showing recent Netflix anthology « Love, Death and Robots » as an example. Two shorts - Witness and Aquila Rift - has a lot of nudity. But one is done with purpose and dare I say, taste, adding to the tone and story, and the other is done because writer and director are talentless hacks who think naked women = good visual storytelling. 

If you compare the two shorts you’ll notice that despite clear time and effort put into both, one is good at all levels, not just usage of nudity, and another is bad at all levels - writing, directing, even character design.

AskFeminists,"I’m not getting this at all from the article. It doesn’t sound like she has a preference at all but rather worries about the equally difficult but different struggles of raising a child perceived as male or female. 

On mentioning she’s rather have a girl:
&gt;	It occurs to me that as a younger person I’d almost automatically imagined myself having a daughter...who had brown eyes and brown hair to mirror my own features, a smaller version of myself.

&gt;	When I bring this thought to my therapist...she says...people may have children to “redo” their own childhood. They want to fix themselves and their traumas by trying again with a fresh start and a mini version of themselves.

She’s afraid the child might be a girl

&gt;	“To be perfectly honest,” I tell my husband over dinner, “**I’m not sure that I even know that I want a girl**. I guess I’d just never really thought about having a boy before. ”

&gt;	“I do worry a girl will have a lot to live up to as your daughter,” he replies. “That’s a lot of pressure.” I wince and think of my own mother and her tales of being homecoming queen...I think of the other physically beautiful mothers I’ve known—the stage moms with their own mini-mes. The way their daughters, even as young girls, seem to know their own beauty, as if they have already lived entire lives in a grown woman’s body...I still fight subconscious and internalized misogyny on a regular basis, catching myself as I measure the width of my hips against another woman’s. Who is to say I’d be able to protect my daughter from it?

And afraid of a boy too: 

&gt;	I’m scared of having a son **too**, although **not in the same way**. I’ve known far too many white men who move through the world unaware of their privilege, and I’ve been traumatized by many of my experiences with them. And boys too; it’s shocking to realize how early young boys gain a sense of entitlement...

&gt;	I’m not scared of raising a “bad guy,”...But I’m terrified of inadvertently cultivating the carelessness and the lack of awareness that are so convenient for men. It feels much more daunting to create an understanding of privilege in a child than to teach simple black-and-white morality. How do I raise a child who learns to like themself while also teaching them about their position of power in the world? 

She didn’t make the list it was her friend, in a period of exasperation, postpartum depression, and sleep deprivation: 

&gt;	My friend who is the mother to a three-year-old boy...After a difficult birth experience, she developed postpartum depression and decided that she resented her husband more than she’d ever imagined possible. 

&gt;	**She told me she particularly hated—and she made an actual, physical list that she kept in her journal, editing it daily—how peacefully he slept**. “There is nothing worse than the undisturbed sleep of a white man in a patriarchal world.” She shakes her head...She also eventually learned to love her husband again.

&gt;“#MeToo should not be limited to art or TV. What’s happening in the world where there’s no glamour is worse. There are powerless people in the world who don’t have a voice, who are struggling in this toxic culture of silence.”

What Hannah Gadsby says here is what I'm thinking about. Even as a reserved term aren't there wider societal implications? If it's just art tv advertising then I'm not sure what my mate is on about. Cheers.",1615560140
AskFeminists,"That's mainly a business decision. Gyms realised that many women don't feel safe or comfortable to train with men, so they don't come. It's marketing to gain customers. 

Men don't seem to feel uncomfortable with women, so they would work out one way or another. I don't see, why gyms would make men only hours when there's little demand for that.

I personally got to a women only gym for different reasons but no men being there was a factor. I don't want my ass and face being judged when I'm doing sport. I can't avoid it on a daily basis but if there are spaces where I can, I'll gladly take the opportunity.",1615559951
AskFeminists,I especially don't like the way she thinks of being out at night as something you can just stop being terrified of. That terror is ingrained pretty deep into my mind as my parents were very strict about that and I lived in a nasty bit of California for a while where all my fears were reinforced (I didn't get raped or mugged or anything but I did see someone get beaten up on the streets and I watched a car blow up) At this point it's just an irrational terror which I will probably never get over,1615559939

AskFeminists,"&gt; does anybody else view her support for ending the harassment of women online as primarily a means to absolve her of her own journalistic errors? 

I don't view it that way. Harassment online is way past holding people accountable. If she's receiving death threats due to an error, it's clear that people were not simply making her know she fucked up. 

&gt; A good example of this is Jim Acosta 

Who?

&gt; Are the swaths of men (and women) who come to the defense of Lorenz not indicative of their desire to infantilize her and absolve her of her own mistakes? 

Infantilize her? Hmn, I don't know. I see this phenomenon way more with men, with sayings such as ""boys will be boys"" and ""he's just 20-29"" for example. Could you give an example of comments that were defending them using infantilization as a tool?

&gt; Is it wrong to expect a certain level of tolerance of online spam from a journalist reporting on heated topics, even if that journalist is a woman? 

No one's obliged to tolerate hatred disguise as criticism and opinions. It's wrong to think that those people have the obligation to endure personal attack and offensive comments because of their jobs. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Is it fair to attribute what happened (is happening) to Taylor Lorenz as a womens' issue 

If she's receiving attacks that focus on her being a woman, using this characteristic to offend her, than it's a problem around women's issues as well as a problem with online harassment.",1615559872

AskFeminists,"I feel like she has good points, and this is a really complicated topic that a thoughtful feminist could come down on either side of.

I went to a university that as one of its core tenets, is integrated with the neighborhood it's built in.  Other schools in my city are in ""nicer"" areas of town, and even then are built with these huge walled-off campuses and green manicured lawns.  My school isn't.  The dorms and student buildings are built on residential streets in a low-income area of town that's rapidly gentrifying with the student population there.  It wasn't unusual to see neighborhood people at college events, or just using the green as a park to play with their kids.  Students from the neighborhood with the grades can go there for free.

And there was this weird attitude you'd often encounter in the students there.  They'd joke frequently about the dangerousness of the neighborhood.  Just really mean stuff, calling specific streets names based on rape jokes and jokes about the murder of sex workers.  It was an attitude that student groups and campus organizations fought against tooth and nail, but they'd also be really really loud about the message of ""don't go out alone at night, use this campus van to drive to take you to the grocery store.""

But also, it was incredibly incredibly dangerous to go out on campus after dark.  I had 3 close and personal friends get robbed at gunpoint.  One year, a female student got kidnapped and forced into a van, and she kicked the shit out of her captors until they dropped her off 3 streets away.  I luckily never was mugged (I never went anywhere alone after dark), but my car was broken into 3 times in 4 years and stolen once.  It was completely appropriate to be cautious walking around campus at night.  Completely appropriate.

But it wasn't that the surrounding neighborhood was full of shitty people.  We were a bunch of fucking rich college kids in a low income area.  Anybody who had it in their minds to mug somebody, we were extremely easy targets.  After I graduated, I lived a couple streets down for the next 5 or 6 years.  It was mostly families, immigrants and people of color, and every time it snowed, we would all go out together and shovel all the driveways and the sidewalks and any time a car got stuck on the road we would all run over and push it out.  Once I left the lights on in my car, and my neighbor who spoke no English knocked on my door, gestured me over, and pointed it out to me.  I have never had such kind and friendly neighbors.

&amp;#x200B;

It's possible for attitudes about safety and danger to be both harmful and justified.  You can be unfairly demonizing a whole neighborhood of people because of racism, and instilling fear as a means of control in women, and also be correct about the level of danger that people are in.

I don't know the right way to combat that.  I think it's a difficult line to walk.  I think that it's important to look at actual data, to determine how dangerous something *actually* is before you tell someone to change her behavior to avoid it.  And to be careful of the way you talk about whole communities of people based on the crimes of a few committed there.  It is a very hard line to walk, but it's one that should be walked with compassion.",1615559841
AskFeminists,"Sex work is both illegal and dangerous. It would also be ridiculous to ask, for example, married people to engage in sex work and violate their marriage vows or risk not receiving unemployment benefits.

I don't see how. Trans women are definitely included, at least in my perception, in women-only hours and locations.

Why? Which reason do they have to demand for a gym to make an exclusive male hour? If they want to do this, they're free to it. But socially they have no problems about harassment, as in the social aspect and behavioral norms, to do so. IMO.

Any company and business can determine exclusivity in their property. If a coffee shop want to do a POC only hour, a women only hour, great, they can. But lgbtq+, I can't even imagine how they'd prove or not someone's sexuality and identity.",1615559179

AskFeminists,"You can tell a lot by who supports her: conservatives, reactionaries like Jordan Peterson. Not mainstream feminists unless you mean ""feminists"" like fellow conservative Christina Hoff Summers. 

Something I didn't realize until looking her up just now, she is also pro-pedophilia?? WTF

&gt;Camille Paglia has for almost three decades unrepentantly advocated for the legalization of sexual contact between adults and children of ""any age"", as well as the legalization of child pornography. She is a pro-pedophilia advocate who has repeatedly given her support to NAMBLA (the North American Man Boy Love Association), and has gone on record numerous times to state that she thinks ""kiddie porn"" should be legalized.

&gt;In Paglia's mind, children are being harmed not by sexual contact with adults, but by society's stigma surrounding pedophilia:

&gt;&gt;The damage from many pedophiliac encounters probably comes, as some psychologists suggest, less from the contact itself than from the culturally enforced stress and secrecy surrounding it. 

&gt;She also explained that the way to put an end to under-age sex tourism in third world countries was to replace Christian morality in the West with ""a more liberal pagan one"" that would allow for adults to freely court children for sex in our own societies. In her mind, the ""sexual borderline"" between adults and children is an artificial construct that society would benefit from deconstructing: ""Lolita melts the sexual borderline that society has artificially drawn between child and adult.""

AskFeminists,"The issue is what time would work? It would be difficult to pick a time that everyone who wants to make it to those hours wouldn't be able to.

Likewise, someone excluded from those hours might already have a relationship with the gym where they were working out at a specific hour that worked for them based on their schedule and they may now get kicked out of the gym for that time if that ends up being the women's only hour that the gym chooses. That would present some pretty serious legal issues.

So it's kind of hard to establish women-only hours at pre-established gyms where you might have to dislocate people who were already there at that hour and can't work out at a different time. I really only see it working for a business that is just starting and having it pre-set from the beginning so members know exactly when they are allowed when they first sign up.

But as for the messaging and the lag inherent somethings missing where progress is either stopped by not being up to date or, as I’ve asked, hindered by messaging ill suited to younger people.

University drop out rate may be a huge factor, I’m a drop out. Between both sexes law school has a high failure rate and the main reason I see people pick law is that coming out of high school as it is now ‘standard’ to try pursue higher education those that see law as the best fit to their personality may be more in line with excelling in environments more focused on wholistic goals.

By that I mean law school is hell and usually only the most studious, competitive and some mix of self esteem and narcissism really excel.

Giving messaging about breaking the glass ceiling might lead more socially minded people to pick the wrong profession.

Or perhaps more likely, law school is fine, law is fine, law school might not need and revision or aid and that the fact that the post graduate opportunities are controlled by people 30-60 years older than law school graduates might mean that any changes to law school would unjustly push for for things that time is already set to fix, I.e: when the generations shift the problem may reveal it self to be already solved.

&gt;Most sex workers would qualify as either indepdent contractors or small business owners, depending on the scale of their practice. 

So how do you deal with a brothel that would list waged labor? An example from Germany:

""A brothel owner in the historic German town of Gvrlitz on the Polish border is preparing to open his establishment next month but faces a one last serious problem — he has no staff. Ulrich Kueperkoch’s adverts seeking “hostesses for erotic services” for his Golden 3 Privatclub have been rejected by Germany’s Federal Labor Office even though prostitution is legal in the country. The dispute with the labor office stems from its refusal to allow advertising for prostitutes in the network of job-placement agencies that it runs. A spokesperson said that the labor office has “decided not to be active in that market sector” due to its belief that such work could infringe on an individual’s rights if he or she is forced to take the job. Kueperkoch insists he would only employ those who were interested and not those who felt they had no other choice.""

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hot-jobs/

I have worked in a gym for 15 years, and in that entire time we have only had two problems of “men harassing women” and they were immediately expunged from the gym and had their memberships revoked. Making eye contact is not harassment. Saying hello isn’t harassment either.  We have also investigated alleged issues of harassment by women, when upon investigation, turned out the guy was just asking to engage in conversation or give her some lifting tips because her form was dangerously off. Just because you make eye contact with a guy in the gym, and you attractive, doesn’t mean he is harassing you or is picturing you naked. This seems like an overt demonization of men. 


The “women’s only” hours are for women who feel self conscious working out  in front of men, or who don’t like the “meathead” aspect of working out in a male dominated gym. 

Or Sometimes it’s something as simple as not wanting to hear the grunting and the dropping of weights. 

This notion that there is some epidemic of men harassing us in gyms is just patently false.

Men feel self conscious when working out too. Men feel “body awareness” as well, especially when they are overweight working out around gorgeous, 10/10, hyper athletic women.  Do you think that men , especially short, weak, or overweight men, aren’t capable of being self conscious or ashamed of their body in front of the opposite sex?

The idea of women getting women’s only buisness hours is strictly as advantage for us, that effects only us. 

Yet we are all dancing around calling it what it is on some misinformed wishy washy anecdotal evidence, which isnt representative of the norm. 

It is a double standard that works in the favour of us women. Plain and simple. 

Yet for some reason, no one on this thread wants to recognize that women have any advantages in society over men.",1615580614

AskFeminists,"Not true. Plenty men feel uncomfortable working out around women , but making a “men only” buisiness hour is financial suicide, as many of our “outspoken radical” feminist sisters think this is a sign of misogyny and treat it as such.

I’m cool with exclusionary buisness hours, but it really only goes one way and it’s in the favour of women almost all the time. Saying “I feel like this when I work out so I need a gender exclusive gym hour” can go both ways. The difference is, no one cares about it when it’s men who bring up the issue.

When men try to open up their own gyms, they get labelled as misogynists, and get vandalized/protested. This happened in my home town of White Rock BC in 2008.

Do you really think men can’t be self conscious or ashamed of their body, or feel uncomfortable working out in front of attractive athletic women?

Imagine your a guy who is overweight and self conscious, and you go to your local gym, and all the women in there are in excellent shape Instagram model levels of fitness. 

You don’t think men ever go through that scenario? Really? 

I don’t understand why so many fellow feminists think being a man is some golden lottery ticket to an easy go lucky life where there is no emotional turmoil.

Just because men don’t express themselves openly(due to being ridiculed for expressing emotion, by men and women) doesn’t mean that these things don’t effect them.

I’m sure if you asked around, many guys, especially the ones who are a little more out of shape, would be a lot more comfortable working out in male only gyms.",1615579667

Seriously, though, I urge you to resist the temptation to think of men's violence against women as something that only (or primarily) happens at the hands of ""the psyco in central park at 2am"". 

[Most women who are raped know their attacker.](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/perpetrators-sexual-violence) That means it's a much deeper problem than a few ""psycos"", as comforting as it might be for us ""non-psycos"" to think in such simplistic terms. 

The unfortunate (and horrifying) truth is that *every* man is capable of committing such violence, and we must start by acknowledging that capacity in ourselves, and resisting it with everything we have. Then we can work on the guys around us. 

Anything less is an insult to the women we love — and (by the way) should be insulting to ourselves as guys, since it suggests that we're incapable of rising above such horrible behavior and selfish ignorance.

And finally: You can ditch the absurd ""in the west"" thing, because it is also beneath you as a human being.

AskFeminists,"I posted a similar question once, but about the traits we found attractive. If we can agree that these preferences are caused or at least influenced by patriarchy, should we strive to ""fix"" and eradicate them? 

However, at the same time, choice is still a non-negotiable tenet of feminism. And your choice is your choice alone.

I think there's no clear cut answer whether it's simply your preferences or you were ""brainwashed"" by the patriarchy into having these likes (and dislikes). You can really apply this logic to a lot of things such as liking makeup or wanting to be a stay-at-home mom. 

But it is important to at least examine where these preferences come from. Maybe it IS caused/influenced by patriarchy, but the question is whether you should get rid of it or not.

As basic and cliche of an answer it is, I think as long as you're still genuinely happy with your decisions, you're not hurting or forcing anyone to align with your preferences, and fully support the reversal of these roles, then you're okay.",1615576386

For at least three hundred years, whenever women have spoken about gender oppression—regardless of what they're saying, what tone they use, how frank or soft their rhetoric is—they are always cast as making too much out of nothing, as using a too-violent discourse, of already having equality and now wanting superiority (I'm not kidding—I can show you 19th-century of men saying that there *used to be* gender oppression, but not anymore).

Here's an example. In the English-speaking West, one of the most respectful postures one can take is to kneel. You can count this as the upper limits of ""soft,"" ""non-aggressive,"" ""inviting"" rhetoric. Yet, kneeling was somehow transformed into and talked about as a ""thuggish"" disrespectful act. The point is that there is no version of ""inviting"" rhetoric that will ever win against people who actively want to deny the realities (the truth) of injustice.

&gt;And frankly, how do you know this to be THE truth? A truth, even?

I think we need to find a way to be comfortable talking about behaviors even if there is an ethnic component to it.

I'm Afro Latina. I can definitely say that there is more fear involved with walking alone ethnically diverse neighborhoods because those are the neighborhoods where I experience street harassment. I can't even count the number of times that I've been followed while walking alone. I have not had that experience in white majority communities and I doubt that that pattern is unique to me. IMOP, the key to not being racist about it is understanding that the present higher prevalence of those behaviors doesn't mean that black and Hispanic men are inherently more sexist. 

You don't solve racism by pretending that these problems don't exist. When you do pretend the problem isn't there, it's not just the white hipster's fear that you're dismissing.

AskFeminists,"Systemic: 

Adjective

relating to or noting a policy, practice, or set of beliefs that has been established as normative or customary throughout a political, social, or economic system:

That definition is EXACTLY what systemic means.



You’re entire premise is based off of anecdotal evidence , and just some over demonization of men. 

I’m telling you from working in a gym as an Hr rep for 15 years, and investigating MULTIPLE accusations of harassment over the years, that your perception of the norm is patently false. 


Your examples of blatant gawking/staring, or being perversely persistent to the point of harassment, ARE NOT THE NORM. Like I said, in my 15 years as a gym professional, I have encountered this legitimately happening to the point where intervention was needed, only twice.
I have investigated over 30 claims however. 

You say “most women don’t complain when men say hello” and this is true. But more women complain when men say an innocuous hello, then men being overtly predatory and   Creepy. And , from what I’ve seen, when those individuals surface, it’s MEN who come to the ladies defence , and the perpetrator in question gets lifetime banned from the gym! 

You don’t seem to understand that how you feel and what you perceive isn’t necessarily the objective truth. 

We had a woman complaining about a man staring at her, and the guy in question was blind! He stares at literally EVERYTHING. 

“In her opinion” 

Her form was dangerously off. We investigated the claim. we have CCTV in every part of the gym except inside the change rooms. She was doing a deadlift far above her safe weight, with unsafe form. The guy said to her “listen I’m not trying to intrude but, your form is dangerously wrong and you might hurt yourself” 

If you don’t think there is any advantage to being a woman at the gym, then you don’t spend much time there.

We have workout programs specifically catered to female forms. Spin, yoga, thai bo, tai chi, etc etc. And while these classes arent inherently exclusive to men, they are specifically catered to target areas which women are trying to target(ass, legs, lower back, waist,, etc etc) . And they are free with membership. 

To get the same classes that cater to men’s ideal workout, you have to pay extra (at least in my gym). Things like fighters class, boxing, powerlifting classes, or high intensity CrossFit. 



We also get full access during norma hours, and we get special hours just for us.

If you want to pretend we don’t have a clear advantage then I won’t stop you.

Gender inequality works for no one. 

In the two answers you have in this sub, you clearly turned something that was asked from a woman's perspective into men's. You denied the existence of the patriarchy as the base of society, which shows your lack of knowledge or just plain ignorance. 

If you think insecure men feeling uncomfortable around athletic women is problem, go fight for it. But do not compare to women being **harassed and assaulted** in gyms by men.

AskFeminists,"What do you mean by “not understanding feminist views?”

Do you mean that I don’t inherently prescribe myself as a victim, and men as perpetrators, based on our sex? That I recognize that being a woman has advantages that men don’t enjoy? Because so far, that’s the only thing I have arguments against. 

Feminism claims to be about equality, yet if someone points out an inequality that works in women’s favour, they get labelled as “non feminist?” 

Is that how the movement works now? Exclude anyone who doesn’t subscribe to the echo chamber status quo of “poor me im just a silly weak woman” ?

Or do you mean not subscribing to the notion that being born male inherently gives you an easy life?

Well I have two sons; a daughter, and have witnessed how I am treated, compared to how my husband is treated, and how my sons are treated compared to my daughter, and myself. Believe it or not, it works both ways. And up until maybe 15 years ago I would say it favoured men much more then women, but that simply isn’t the case today. 

 I thought feminism was about gender equality of opportunity, and calling out systemic discrimination that effects both genders? 

Recognizing the litany of advantages being female gives me (and you can’t pretend there aren’t any) doesn’t make me any less feminist than you.  

Yes being female also comes with a litany of disadvantages too, just like being male comes with both as well. 

The difference is, I don’t inherently give myself victimhood status, or demonize men by default.

&gt;  Making eye contact is not harassment. Saying hello isn’t harassment either. We have also investigated alleged issues of harassment by women, when upon investigation, turned out the guy was just asking to engage in conversation or give her some lifting tips because her form was dangerously off.

Saying hello is not harassment. But continuously bothering them and repeatedly trying to engage in conversation when they say they are not interested in talking is harassment. Most women definitely do not complain just because some guy said only ""hello"" and then just walked away after they didn't show any interest.

&gt; Just because you make eye contact with a guy in the gym, and you attractive, doesn’t mean he is harassing you or is picturing you naked. This seems like an overt demonization of men. 

There is a difference between staring and eye contact. Do these men just make eye contact and look away? Nope! They stare up and down your body. And this isn't something that happens only in gyms either. This happens even in the streets.

&gt; The “women’s only” hours are for women who feel self conscious working out in front of men, or who don’t like the “meathead” aspect of working out in a male dominated gym. 

Why do you think they feel self conscious about working out in front of men? Do you not think that the unsolicited advice on lifting because the woman's form was dangerously off in their opinion or trying to engage in conversations even after turning them down repeatedly had anything to do with this?

If it's a US charity the IRS also has a charity look-up tool (IF the organization is a registered 501(c)3.... which a 'charity' doesn't have to be).

AskFeminists,"I don't necessarily think tampons should be free (at least not in the context of capitalism). I think they should be possible to obtain for free in some circumstances and settings, and low cost otherwise, just as condoms and toilet paper are. Not having access to them is a health risk  and also limits the ability of women and girls (and trans guys/NB folks who menstruate) to participate in economic and social life. It's also a cost that only people who menstruate have to bear, and depending on an individual's cycle and budget that cost can be considerable. I would like to see ""single servings"" of basic models available for free in public/institution restrooms, like toilet paper, and packs available for on request in particular circumstances, like at schools, universities, food banks, etc, a bit like condoms.",1615607596
AskFeminists,"I'm from South America, were tampon use is not widely extended amongst teenage and the most vulnerable women population. But just as /RisingQueenx said, poverty is the main reason why I think, in my country's case, period pads should be given for free to girls and menstruating women, as has been said, just like toilet paper, soap and potable water is accessible for free in first world countries.

I recall during my early teens, we used to ask amongst us classmates when we were on an emergency if anyone has a spare pad to give us. We always share. When you are a 12 year old girl in a Latin American country, back in the early 90's it was kind of taboo, unfortunately. We asked our teacher to.had an.emergency pack for those cases. 

I wonder about girls in places even less fortunate than us, like some places in India (I recall the short film ""Period. End of sentence."") and the middle East, or some countries in South East Asia. I think all menstruating women who struggle to afford their basic needs covered should get free period pads/tampons (according to culture I guess).

End of 2019, 92% of domestic abuse prosecutions were against male abusers. Only 8% were related to female abusers.

75% of victims of domestic abuse are women. Think you've misread your statistic.

16% of cases were male victims.

&gt;A women can say that a man raped her and it will destroy him, it doesn't matter if he is convicted or not, the meter accusation can crush a man.

Myth

&gt;Women are given soul custody in custody battles unless the man can prove that she is not fit to be a parent.

False.

91% of men do not fight for custody. They wish for the children to stay with the mother.

Of the 9% that fight. 67% win custody over mothers. 

When the mother alleges abuse or child sexual abuse, this actually INCREASES his chances of custody.

The reason most women have custody of children is simply because men don't fight for them. When they do, they're more likely to win.


&gt;Men are socially conditioned to not show off their feelings, if they do they are called weak pussies. If a women shows her feelings in public she is congratulated for being a strong women.

Women are not congratulated. I'd like to live in the world you think you live in.

Women are called clingy, over emotional, cry babies, asked if they're on their period, told they can't hold higher positions because of their emotions, nagging, whining, etc.

Women are more likely to suffer from depression, and three times more likely to attempt suicide than men. Yet every mental health advert is directed at men.

Both men and women suffer, and can't show emotion.

&gt;Feminists give false information such as the wage gap. It has been debunked multiple times

Nope.

Those studies use companies which VOLUNTEER their data. No company is volunteering their data if they under pay women. This is what leads to the belief that it has been debunked, but it has not. Thousands of companies continue to under pay and undervalue women, but because they're not revealing their data, keep salaries private between co workers, and there is no government body investigating...they can hide it pretty easily.

AskFeminists,"Period poverty. Girls being unable to afford products so they skip school and miss out on education. Same with adults. A Canadian study found 75% of women have had to skip work due to period related issues such as not having products on hand. Like think about it...its naturally to pee and poop, so schools, work, and public places provide free toilet paper, soap, and water. It's also natural for women to get their periods, so why would products not be available for that too? If it happened to men it most certainly would be free.

Free condoms are pretty accessible. You can get a free prescription for viagra in many places. Male safety and sexual pleasure is prioritised over women and something they never asked for but get every month.

Expensive. It's another thing women have to pay for that is an unfair price. Women get paid less for the same work, have less opportunities for promotion, etc etc etc. And have to pay extra for most their products. Thus making it easier for men to save up and get ahead, afford more luxuries, while women do not. This is applied to more than just period products. E.g. some athletes foot treatments are the exact same as womens thrush treatments. However the thrush treatment is a lot more expensive because...it's for women.

""What would you in this hypothetical?"" at best results in some kind of idealised response -- you mention below worrying about them giving an answer because they think you want it rather than what you actually think, instead I think the bigger risk is them giving the answer that they think when given time / a safe situation in which to consider. This maybe doesn't match what they do in a highly emotional moment when they are shocked / terrified / etc..

I think a reasonable starting point might be ""have you been faced with this situation? / what did you do? / what do you feel about the situation in hindsight?"". But I think you need to be genuinely willing to take any answer in good faith and respond with genuine empathy. I can't speak for anyone else but I'd be surprised if many people have actually had experiences where their friends make overtly sexist jokes or catcall people or etc., so be prepared for that, or for complexity.

AskFeminists,", you assign these things to “the patriarchy”, which is just a round about way or saying you blame men, and their oppressive ways, for them. It seems like a really convenient cop out, anything that men are suffering from, it’s “the patriarchies” fault. Not like we as women perpetuate these cultural norms or anything right? 

I defined patriarchy as how it is defined in the dictionary. A society that excludes women from power and disadvantages women over men in a systemic and cultural way. We, by definition, do not fit that in the secular west. I’m not saying we have achieved perfect gender equality not at all. But we , by definition, do not live in a patriarchal society. 

If you need to revise the meanings of words to victimize yourself, your ideology needs re-examining.

 I don’t really want to turn this into a “he vs she” because if you compare the two worldwide, women are still suffering more than men that cannot be denied. And historically, women have had their agency restricted as well.

But in the secular west, we enjoy a litany of advantages over men, and the fact that you have to ask  and are unaware of what they are shows that I was right and you haven’t ever tried to empathize with men. 

Now this isn’t to say we don’t have disadvantages as well. They work in different aspects 


But since you asked ok:

You mentioned the draft. Well, not being drafted is a systemic law, that we as women enjoy. It’s an advantage, whether you want to blame men for it or not. Our right to vote isn’t predicated on the draft, theirs is. 

You mentioned emotional unavailability? Well that bleeds into my next point of male disposability. Society views men’s lives as expendable, and women’s lives as valuable. Which is why we have had our agency so heavily restricted traditionally, and why women have been oppressed worldwide in every culture. Because, if you completely objectify us, it’s clear that we are a valuable resource. Perhaps THE most valuable. The ability to give life. Since men lack this ability, their lives have been deemed completely expendable, and this bleeds into every facet of our culture. Violence against men is so normalized we never even think about it when we see it. Can you name me a single movie, that wasn’t a horror film (because those by definition are supposed to horrify you) that depicts women on the receiving end of the same kind of violence men are in The first 5 minutes of Saving Private Ryan? Or any other of those fighting or war movies? And when women are killed, it’s usually done off screen, or in a less “excruciating” manner. 

Female illnesses get more public awareness and funding then male. Testicular/prostate cancer gets 1/6 the funding breast/cervical does , despite killing as many or more amounts of people 

In countries/states with unrestricted or highly liberal abortion laws, we have more bodily autonomy. Male infant circumcision, an abhorrent practice, is widely accepted, and even perpetuated by women. The circumcised penis is deemed “normal” looking. Female circumcision, is recognized for what it is: an abhorrent disgusting crime to commit against a non-consenting infant. 

Being the presumed caregivers in divorce

Insanely stacked divorce court against the non-presumed caregiver, which is almost always the father. Especially if the father is the primary breadwinner, he ends up more often then not, paying for a house he doesn’t get to live in, and rarely if ever seeing his kids. 

Us Getting on average 40% of the sentence for the exact same crime as men

Being 1/100 as likely to receive the death penalty, for the exact same crime

Living 9 years longer on average 

We die at work at 1/20 the rate men do

Public and post secondary education is leaving boys behind and using teaching models which have been proven to advantage women at the cost of boys. This is clear in declining male education rates 

84% of alimony is paid by men to women 

Men make up 44% of domestic violence victims, and 70% of non-reciprocated domestic violence victims (where the victim isn’t fighting back at all) , yet not even 1% of shelters, which are mostly woman run and funded, accept them. I dunno how you can blame that one on “patriarchy”.

Making up the majority of college acceptance/graduates /scholarship recipients despite also making up the majority of enrolled students post secondary 

Our blatant advantage in the dating market.m, especially if your young and pretty but, being able to have companionship whenever we want it is something we take for granted. And if you go further into this point, it gets more blatant how much we control in dating. We control sex, we get to accept/reject advances at our whim. This may seem like a small thing, but that’s only because you have always had it. To someone who has never had it, it’s invaluable. 

Our lives having inherent value by the nature of our birth. See my point about male disposability 

Being presumed the non-aggressor in any confrontation between a man and ourselves 

And lastly we have a complete monopoly on reproductive rights. To the point where , no matter what we choose to do reproductively , it’s how it goes down and the man has no choice but to go along with it. He cannot opt out of parenthood. 

This point is so stacked in our favour that it’s actually legal to commit paternity fraud. You and I as women, could hypothetically cheat on our partner, get pregnant, bear the baby and raise it as our partners, and then get found out when the child grows, and not only are we not criminally liable for the child but, the man we did this too is still financially responsible for a child that isn’t biologically his! 

it’s also  completely legal in all 50 states to not tell the man you are pregnant, and keep that mans biological child away from him. 

“Baby trapping” is also completely legal in all 50 states. To the point where a woman can actually take a mans sperm from a condom, impregnate herself even though he didn’t consent to unprotected sex, and then hold him financially responsible for the child.

If he says/does things that you find unsavory, that is a reason in itself to stop being friends with him. You don't need to try prod his psyche for where he might trip up, and beyond that it can all too quickly become about proving your own views on the matter and about him than actually gauging his responses (the post a few weeks ago about guys giving a friend a bunch of scenarios when he called out another shared friend's as sexual assault the the flip-side version of this). 

Treat like a discussion, and if you think he has a questionable opinion on something, (provided they don't cross a personal red line for you) ask him why he thinks that, try to clarify misconceptions and possibly try to gently nudge him in the right directly. I can say personally that most guys don't want to hurt people, but we might have learned bad lessons from the authority figures and peers in our lives that need to be unlearned (which is a long process in itself). Be careful not to treat that process as like a 'pet project', though; I know there are guys out there who are jaded towards feminists/women because someone in their past treated them like a 'problem needing fixing'.

If you want to discuss this stuff with him, you could start with using a situation involving someone you and he are emotionally connected to, like 'I heard/saw x say \[sexist comment joke\]/catcall someone, can you believe that?', or 'Y had a rough night out recently, there was this guy who wouldn't leave her alone even when told him to.' You even use yourself, use an example from your life, like being catcalled or when you felt like you were being followed or something. By starting a conversation that's more personal, you can then transition it into a discussion of harassment and consent. One thing to note with the approach, though, is that personal connections do colour how we treat situations, and he might say one thing with a generic example but act differently if he knows the attacker/victim/both.

You could also use big cases that appear in the news, like the Sarah Everard one, but that can be tricky as cases that are widely spoken also see alot of hot takes and can affect a person's responses. Using examples where he might have not a formed an opinion yet are useful in grasping how he processes them and how he reaches the conclusions he does.

Hell, if you even use 'I was reading this book/online recently, and found out that \[statistic\]'. Cold statistics help avoid possible biases, and can prevent a conversation being coloured by opinions of the people involved or prior reading, which can lead to him answering in a more straightforward manner. As I said previously, though, this can mean you get a sense of how he might act hypothetically, but perhaps not in reality, especially if he knows someone involved.

I don't there's any 'right way' to start this conversation - its a difficult and often personal topic, and you know what approach to discussion works for him better than I ever could.

As to examples, another 'do not' I would avoid is anything 'conventional' to get the most nuanced responses. That's not to say you shouldn't use them, as a jumping off point, but most guys are going to say they support a victim if you say 'x forced themselves on y', and you aren't going to learn much from that. You might get a different response if you ask them about 'z taking back some out their face drunk to their place', or 'z bothering this person after being told now, or 'a grabbed/slapped b's butt without asking', or even 'a and b were having sex, and b didn't seem to care when a felt like they wanted to stop'. Likewise with harassment, its easy for guys to say 'catcalling is bad', but if you make a point about how someone harassed someone and no-one helped, particular if its a woman who's the victim with men as bystanders, you might get a different response. Non-conventional scenarios make us question how we would react in those scenarios, and often result in us understanding and verbalising our own views in a manner that more solid that just 'sexual harassment/assault is bad'.

I would also use a mix of genders. People can and do act differently if it's 'he on she' vs 'she on he', or 'she on she' vs 'he on he', or with gender non-conforming people ('he/she on they'), etc. I would try to insert these naturally, as how he reacts to them will also give you an inkling into his views on gender stereotypes and LGBT+ people alongside his opinions of harassment and consent.

One thing I would also suggest possibly doing (but be careful in how you word it) is ask if anyone in their life had ignored their consent, or overstepped a boundary. I know one of the most frank discussions I've ever had with male friends is one guy saying 'this girl in the club last week kept touching me, and was being a bitch when I told to go away' (not saying that's the best way he could of said, just that's how he described it) - I brought up how I'd had guys grope me before similarly, and said what they did was sexual harassment and even assault. They all then came out with stories of men and women overstepping boundaries and coming the brutal realisation that 'oh. we've all be sexually harassed or assaulted here'. It was eye-opening experience for all of us. I would avoid alot of caution here, though, as it could lead to re-living a traumatic experience they didn't want to talk about.

Talking all about the generalization of men and how all of you aren't bad people. It's a typical \#NotAllMen, which is done to dismiss the struggles of women and to derail conversations, like when it's about sexual assualt or the attitudes that men have over women as a whole and then derailing that conversation to make it everything about men rather than what women go through and reflecting on your attitudes.",1615630563

I want to be able to eat steak without the fear of getting lynched and also fully support the rights and liberation of women and therefore strongly oppose the patriarchy.

So, if I said that I fear black men when I walk around London because they might stab me, what is the difference between that and what women say about men in general? Men are the victims of violent crimes more often than women, and therefore I have the right to be scared of knife crime - but does that also give me the right to make comments about black people that are the main perpetrators of such crimes in London?

Or, on the other said, there are men that often generalise all women due to the relationships they have had with women in the past.

AskFeminists,"Minority groups are subject to bias based on the salient exemplar , wherein subjectivity is denied and everyone in a group is seen as a monolith, in ways that majority groups are not.  


This bias often goes along with forms of marginalisation and are used to perpetuate and maintain systemic oppression. This contributes to situations where people assume that *All Muslims* are terrorists, or that *All Black men* are violent. Where such stereotypes are deployed in an essentialising manner, showing that it is in fact not true is of value.   


The problem with not all men is that we generally offer cishet men that subjectivity and recognise their individuality, and we do not assume that all men are predators, for example , so Not All Men is a refutation to an argument we aren't making. As such, it is a non-sequitur, whereas in the case of marginalised groups (which can be marginalised subgroups of *men)* , due to the biases involved, it is a lot more relevant.

First of all, the fact that you have noticed this behavior about yourself and want to change it is the best first step you can take, especially impressive to have this mindset at 15 years old.
You said that your gender is irrelevant, but I think it's very relevant if you experience male privilege or not in this question, I will assume you do.

The feelings of being resentful isn't uncommon at all, infact I understand it.
To better explain, I'll give you an example where I experienced similar feelings.
I'm white, and when I was younger, I would have the same feelings when people of color would explain their experiences with white people.
I got defensive, thinking ""I would never say/do that! My friends wouldn't either"" etc. 
I realized pretty quickly how ignorant my response was.
Here are these people of color, who have experienced racism their entire life, trying to have an discussion about racism with white people. 
After reading all that, my response was ""But I don't do that!"".
I understand how ignorant it is for me to be angry about generalization when they're talking about such a serious topic as racism.
To expect oppressed groups to stop generalizing when talking about discrimination is such a non-issue. The reason we do this is because we don't want to take accountability.
I've never discriminated against a person of color, but I've definitely done it passively.
By saying ""Not all X!"" I was minimizing the issue at hand. By uncomfortably laughing when someone said a racist joke, or being quiet when someone said the N-word like it was any other word, I was teaching the people around me that it's okay to behave like that.

Being a man, it's hard and can even be shocking to hear women's stories about men, and how they may resent men. 
But we can't keep tip-toeing around the subject of discrimination. After decades of discrimination, women's voices and stories about sexism weigh more than men feeling uncomfortable.
After discriminating women for decades, it's completely nonsense to expect women to also take care of men's issues, which stems from a system men created to benefit men, the patriarchy.
There isn't a magic pill you can take to understand the female perspective of sexism. The only thing you can do is listen to women, and understand the power of privilege.
You don't have to be a superhero that crushes the patriarchy every single day, nobody can do that.
Like I said in my example earlier, if you stop allowing ""passive"" sexism in your everyday life, that's a huge step.

AskFeminists,"&gt; I pointed out that it’s fine for women to fear all men and that generalisations about men in terms of the threat they pose is fine - my point is that, often, these fears lead into other generalisations about the nature of men in general. This is an important distinction to make and it seems that people reading these posts do not recognise this distinction.

The things you're saying is exactly the \#NotAllMen, this whole worrying about generalization of men and making it about men and derailing the conversation from the oppression of women.

&gt; This is not a #notallmen post at all. I am just concerned with people using issues concerning sexual harassment to make comments about men that are not explicitly related to sexual issues. This same thing happens with race and men make the same generalisations about women as well, usually in a romantic context.

What makes you so cocerned about this rather than the victims and what they go through? And these generalizations aren't comparable due to power dynamics. 

&gt; This sort of comment that you make is what I think scares a lot of guys in this scenario. You can be fearful of men in general because of the threat some pose and you can of course try to spread awareness to men about what sexual harassment is and how to prevent. But, you can’t use sexual harassment by males as an excuse to discount men’s opinions on certain topics, you cannot use it to say men are intelligent and you cannot use it to say men are undeserving of certain luxuries.

You mean the usual men's opinions like dismissing that issue, victim blaming, trying their hardest to downplay those issues, doing whataboutery and try to derail the conversation doing \#NotAllMen? Then ofcourse it's going to be dismissed.",1615643149

What I have done is drawn a correlation between the two. Men are victims to knife crime on a scale larger than women, and the dominant perpetrator of knife crime in various areas of the UK are black people. Women are victims of sexual harassment on a scale larger than men, and the dominant perpetrator of sexual harassment are men.

*With that said*, as with other systemic issues and other abolitionist perspectives, it's rarely as simple as just making the oppressive system disappear. Just like the existing economic system in the US depends on patriarchy to survive (particularly the value created by unpaid domestic tasks), such that just abolishing those practices without restructuring things would create major issues around, for example, childcare, much of the world's food system (especially in wealthier countries) has created structures of dependence on animal exploitation.

AskFeminists,"If you are asking why feminist activists don't advocate for better care of/for men's mental health... the answer is that it is not the thing they are fighting for. 

Feminist activism is targetted at structural reforms in and around issues pertaining to the treatment of women and is often, at times, in allegiance with LGBTQ+ activism. 

Consider: Why don't animal rights activists support male mental health? The question is rather silly and should be obvious, that isn't the issue they fight for. In activism your best (pragmatic) bet is usually too narrow the focus of your actions as that brings the best results. You cannot simultaneously fight for every worthy cause, a person and people are finite in their allotted time and capacity... They have to pick their fights or they'd be stretched thin to the point of being able to do nothing.

If you are talking about feminists as individuals, as opposed to activists, many (including me) are concerned with the mental health of men. I think this issue should be taken seriously and that men have historically been unwilling to take care of their mental health. Primarily because in a patriarchal society wherein the man must always be seen as strong they cannot afford to be seen as having problems with their mental health... If a man is seen as weak in a patriarchal society he will all too often become an object of ridicule. That is the application of a little feminist theory to the question...

So a person who is in a food desert and doesn't have good access to vegetables, but seeks to exclude animal products or access them in a less exploitative way (such as dumpster diving) could still consider themselves vegan even if they need to supplement their diet with animal products. Veganism as a movement, especially liberal veganism, can definitely have classist elements, but I wanted to clarify because a lot of people aren't aware of how many leftist vegans work to incorporate anti-classism and anti-ableism into the definition.

This is false. You can get all the protein you need from grains and legumes, and it's definitely cheaper than a meat based diet. Meat is expensive. Ask any poor person. Meat is an expensive luxury in most developing countries. This is long established fact. It takes WAY more resources to grow a cow from grains than to just eat those grains. Chickens are somewhat more environmentally friendly, but it's still more efficient and cheaper to just eat the grains.

If you want to buy loads of processed food in fancy packages, then sure, being vegan can be more expensive. But that's certainly not a requirement to be vegan. Rice and beans is vegan, and is very cheap compared to meat. You can even add very protein dense nuts and seeds and it will still be cheaper than a meat based diet.",1615639574

AskFeminists,"&gt;So, if I said that I fear black men when I walk around London because they might stab me, what is the difference between that and what women say about men in general?

Aside from the obvious racism? 

Have you ever had a black man openly admit to you that he'd like to stab you? Have you ever been told that it was probably a compliment if a black man told you he wanted to stab you? Are you likely to be blamed if you are stabbed by a black man? Is he likely to be apprehended, tried, and convicted for his violent assault on your person? Are people likely to ask you why you were out in a place to be stabbed? Are people likely to question what you did to draw the attention of this black man who stabbed you? Are people likely to ask what you were wearing to attract the attention of the black man who stabbed you? Are people likely to discredit your story of being stabbed by a black man based on your friendships with other black men? If you were intoxicated, are people likely to frame your intoxication as an irresponsibility in which your being stabbed by a black man is an inevitable outcome?  Are people likely to assume that you were lying about being stabbed? Are people likely to assume that you in fact invited this black man to stab you and simply regret the outcome because it didn't go as planned? Are you likely to lose your friends and family because they don't believe you were stabbed by a black man? Would your friends find it hard to believe you  because they've never known a black man who stabbed anyone?",1615638865

AskFeminists,"Not really. I think there is a slight possibility here in the U.S. but your causal mechanism is wrong. It's not enough to want to commit violence; you have to be *competent* in it, which involves a degree of socialization and comfort with violence not afforded to women. 

For example, you can see in U.S. data on [suicidal ideation, attempts, and completion](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/suicide.shtml) that women are more likely to think about or try suicide, but less likely to kill themselves. Men are much more likely to kill themselves, and a lot of that is men's comfort and competence with guns (it's not like it's so much harder for a woman to obtain a gun in the US). The same is true of men's violence against others: they are more competent because they have been socialized int it. 

So as U.S. society becomes more comfortable with the idea of women as soldiers and cops and other gun-wielding occupations, we can expect more women to become comfortable with guns and so more likely to use guns. In which case we might see a rise in women-committed violence, but not solely women-on-men violence. The female-on-male violence we do see won't be significantly political in the sense you have in mind, if at all; it will be women using violence in the same sorts of situations men do. (And this is speculation, but it seems to me the women most committed to the feminist movement will be least likely to join gun-wielding professions). However much female-on-male violence increases, we can expect a sharper rise for women's suicides. 

So no, I don't think it's going to happen. 

Incidentally, 'lame' is considered by many people [to be an ableist word](https://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html). You might be using 'insane' a little too casually, too.",1615637980

This is not a #notallmen post at all. I am just concerned with people using issues concerning sexual harassment to make comments about men that are not explicitly related to sexual issues. This same thing happens with race and men make the same generalisations about women as well, usually in a romantic context.

This sort of comment that you make is what I think scares a lot of guys in this scenario. You can be fearful of men in general because of the threat some pose and you can of course try to spread awareness to men about what sexual harassment is and how to prevent.

I think it's a complex issue, because there is no such thing as ethical mass production of food, whether it involves animal products or not.

It sounds like your relationship is in a really rough spot. Sex can be a barometer for the health of a relationship. When the relationship isn't in a good place, sex plummets. It can be a symptom of a deeper issue, not the actual issue itself.

If the solution you and your wife came to was to schedule regular sex, it might be that you and her are trying to treat the symptom (no sex) instead of the root cause.

If there is a unresolved root cause that is making her not truly want to have sex with you, you most definitely could pick up on that. She may even say the words ""I enthusiastically give consent"" and want to mean it, but we can't force our bodies to be into sex that we don't truly want.

Think of other situations where a partner may have wanted to explore some that their partners doesn’t, or have sex with someone that has features that their partner doesn’t—take bdsm, or a very large-breasted woman while their partner has small breasts. Would *those* situations warrant exploration and would this couple still consider themselves monogamous?",1615655008
AskFeminists,"This is a great question! :) It's not an uncommon scenario, and I think you'll get a variety of opinions on this. For me the answer is kind of complicated. Going by the quote ""she feels no need to explore with other men,"" I certainly wouldn't consider it to be *as* problematic, because the man isn't imposing a view on who she can and cannot date on the basis of gender. I would consider that a private, personal decision about who she wants to pursue in a nonmonogamous relationship, rather than an OPP where you have a ""policy"" or agreement with your primary partner.

With that said, I still think this can get dicey. Part of this stems from my own experiences. I'm a bisexual woman-aligned nonbinary person.\* I've dated a few bisexual women who are in primary relationships with men or who have mostly only dated men. Some of those relationships have been really positive; in other situations I've felt very strongly that I was not really being seen as a person, but more as a novelty or a way for the person I was dating to validate her bisexuality and her attraction to women. So in general I feel wary of people who are looking to date a certain gender for the ""experience"" of it. Dating a woman is not the same as dating a man, but the experience of dating one man is also very different from the experience of dating another, and the same goes for two different relationships with women.

Particularly in the bisexual community, I think it's easy for a weird sort of fetishization of a specific gender to emerge. If you look through bisexual meme pages, you see a lot of memes like ""Yes, i'm bisexual: I'm attracted to women because women are incredible, and I'm attracted to men because i love making bad choices."" And I think that's something to challenge because it puts women on a weird pedestal (even as it also puts down men).

Sorry, that went a little off-topic. I guess ultimately I still think it's something to interrogate: What does someone think they will get out of a relationship with a woman that is different? Do they have unreasonable expectations of their potential partner? etc. But I think of it a little more positively than having a rule imposed by someone who doesn't take relationships with women seriously.

AskFeminists,"I don't think it's inherently ""feminist"" to make (or respect) a choice. Certainly, I wouldn't criticize someone's choices within their relationship, since I know from personal experience that relationships can get into pretty weird territory; but I don't think this is relevant to feminism.

A feminist take could very well be ""forgiving the cheating just because it was with a woman is disrespectful towards same-sex attraction,"" even if the same feminist making this observation does not actually intervene in the relationship.",1615653612
AskFeminists,"I hate to break this to you, but this sort of thinking is what creates men that struggle to talk with women about these issues. Talking about ‘fragile male egos’, saying ‘you assholes’ etc, stating how we can’t even try to understand what you’re going through does not help the situation.

Believe me, I want to understand, and I really would like to try and be part of the solution and not the problem. But if women like yourself want to encourage more men to stop being ‘assholes’, or at least to get more men to call out those that are being ‘assholes’, stop using the phraseology of racists, antisemites, islamophobes, sexists etc to belittle and target men. If anything, this does more to stray many further from the fundamental issue of sexual harassment as opposed to bringing men’s attention to it. 

P.S, I am sorry for the harassment you have faced. I too have been a victim at times, but I know that is not as incessant and damaging towards males.",1615653595

Of all six of the people who have sexually abused me (I was trafficked as a child in case you were curious) they were all men. So maybe men should start doing most of the leg-work?

AskFeminists,"So I just went and looked more into the OPP and  I have some questions (if you wouldn’t mind helping me out). I’m trying to fully understand the issue. I feel like I am at a disadvantage for really understanding because I am not fully immersed in the LGBT community. I try to keep up but I don’t always know. 

Let’s say there’s a heterosexual couple and the women recently decided she’s bi. She had grown up in a conservative home and never explored the female attracted side, but he husband encourages her to express when she sees people she’s attracted to (ie in movies and things). 

This turns into permission to test out her female attracted side. Her male attracted side has already been explored and she has settled and enjoys her husband, so she feels no need to explore with other men.

AskFeminists,Sexual assault is one of the easiest crimes to get away with. Easy enough where I saw Twitter thread from a rapist’s perspective explaining how to get away with tape. Not everyone is going to have their assault captured on multiple cctv cameras unless it’s a blitz attack that happens outside in a big city like mine but that’s if you’re “ lucky” enough to have it captured. Not everyone is “lucky” to have multiple witnesses. Want to know why? Because rapists don’t usually rape in front of other people unless those other people are partaking in it. Some victims don’t go to the hospital/police immediately after for a myriad of reasons. I run a statistically small chance believing a liar and it’s a fact whether you want to accept it or not.,1615652034
AskFeminists,"In my opinion, your responses epitomise everything that is wrong about these discussions. You, and many other feminists, are constantly going back to labelling every opinion on this topic as just a #notallmen post. However, as I have explained many times, I am concerned about victims of sexual harassment and I believe that is the fundamental issue at hand. But, people use this as a pretext for the shaming of others for reasons not related to sexual harassment.

Also, how is the generalisations about race/women different to generalisations about men? They are all concerned with a victim/perpetrator relationship?

And the reason I am concerned about generalisations at this time is because of the fact victimhood should never EVER be seen as an excuse to belittle others for unrelated reasons, no matter who is doing the generalising. It is not a healthy way to start a movement and bring awareness to a central issue.",1615651913

AskFeminists,"Having a fetish doesn't make you a bad person. Cheating kind of does. As long as everyone is happy, the arrangement is fine. The only slight issue is that all must remember that relationships involving two women are just as serious as those that involve a man and a woman. So don't get into the ""it's not cheating because it was another woman"" territory. That doesn't mean that it's not ok to set a boundary that she won't have sex with other men, but she will have sex with other women, though. But all parties need to think about why they find that acceptable. For example, if she is sexually attracted to women but not romantically attracted to women, that is honest and as long as nobody objects, go for it.

AskFeminists,"Fair enough, on a per-gram of protein basis lentils actually cost less than meat. But however they don't contain [all](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/lentils) the essential amino acids, but however that they can be done by combining it with rice or wheat, making it a complete protein, so you can't have them individually, you would have to combine it with something. You would need to have that right combination.

But for getting a high amount of protein with lentils it isn't easy to do that. According to [this](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lentils#nutrition) source the amount of protein in one cup or 198 g of cooked lentils is 17.9 g with 230 kcals, but however that isn't a small amount of lentils, you would have to eat a lot of them. To just even get like 50 g from it, you would need to consume more than a pound of it along with something else so as to make it a complete protein, further increasing the calories to get that. For the lean cut of beef, the [amount](https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Beef%2C_raw%2C_95%25_lean_meat_%252F_5%25_fat%2C_ground_nutritional_value.html) protein in it is 21 g per 100 g with 137 kcals or about 42 g per 200 g and 274 kcals. That's more than twice the amount for a slightly higher kcals, while for beef you can get 50 g of protein for just eating slightly less than half a pound of it, which is much easier to do.

If you're someone who wants to eat a lower calories diet but still wants atleast like 150 g of protein then getting it done using a vegan diet isn't easy, there's too many carbs in lentils to let you get the high amount of protein in a lower amount of calories, so you might require protein supplements which then costs a lot of money.",1615649504

AskFeminists,"A couple thoughts on this.

* If they wouldn't let him in if women are uncomfortable, then it isn't truly trans inclusive. It's just the only thing available for him. 
* Saying ""other ladies"" in the context of that last sentence makes it sound like you consider him as a lady from how it reads, which I doubt is your intention or how you see him. I just wanted to point that out because language and context is important and conveys more than surface level meaning, especially with the subtle nuance in gender topics.
* Saying ""this is understandable"" and following with a ""but"" negates the initial statement. Yes, my views on this are valid. So are your cousin's as another trans person. In my original comment, I even said that not every trans person will look at this the same. If the only option is a women's time slot that is open to all trans people, then we would have to be okay with that out of necessity. What is better is an LGBTQ+ specific time slot, but that isn't a common practice in gym settings, so we are forced to accept women time slots or not. I don't, but your cousin is certainly within his right to make his own decision with that.
* I'd be interested in hearing from your cousin first hand on this rather than someone speaking on his behalf. I'm sure if given the option of a women's safe space and a LGBTQ+  safe space, he'd probably prefer the latter because then he doesn't run the risk of being shut out if women in the their dedicated space don't want him there.",1615646174

Breasts are not inherently sexual. Why? The only function of breasts is to feed babies. They are often erogenous zones, yes, but so are ears, and no one asks people to cover up their ears.

If you go to other countries (ex. certain tribes in Africa) women walk around topless and it’s normal. The only reason boys think they’re “magical” is because they are seen as taboo due to sexualization by men.

AskFeminists,"I don't believe there is a spectrum of consent. 

There is a spectrum of *activities* you can consent to, and there is a spectrum of *clarity* of communication (non-verbal vs ""OK"" vs ""here is exactly what I do and do not want"")

But consent is either yes or no. 

It's either there or it isn't. If it's not clear consent, then you assume there is no consent. Which is why it's not considered consent if the person is intoxicated, or a minor. Maybe under other circumstances they would still say yes, but you can't know that, so you have to treat it as a no.

It sounds like you objected to the lack of intimacy and connection, because you want your wife to be enthusiastic -- which is certainly reasonable. And maybe she went along with your statement because she was relieved not to feel obligated. But I don't think you ever had an issue of consent. She consented, however grudgingly.

AskFeminists,"I have done my own research. Patriarchy was not created by men. It was first established in smaller tribal units and men became dominant figures because of their physical superiority - in a world built on violence, the more physical beings took hold of leadership. ‘Patriarchal’ ideas were created and reasserted by men throughout history, particularly in relation to religion. 

I also don’t think the patriarchal system was designed to oppress women - as many academics agree. It was a system designed so that every one in society was deemed to have a ‘proper’ place. I’m not saying that this was the right thing to do at all, that’s just the idea behind it. I also do think the system has oppressed women, but I don’t think the initial intention of it was to suppress women. 

In terms of patriarchy today, I’m not entirely sure it exists. There are ideas and beliefs that circulate that could exist under patriarchal structures, but patriarchy doesn’t really exist as a system nowadays in my opinion.

I know that you can say rape culture, the wage gap etc are examples that ‘prove’ the existences patriarchal system, but they just aren’t. Men are more often victims of violent crime, more men are incarcerated, most of the victims of war are men, most people that are homeless are men and it can even be argued that men are more persecuted and disproportionately discriminated against in many things, such as scholarships or job hiring. Even in terms of economic dominance, those in the very top are a group of extremely successful men that in no way represent men as a whole. I don’t think the sexist opinions of a minority men are sufficient to explain the existence of a patriarchy.

Now it’s true, we as humans have to be more accountable. We have the brain power to understand and bodies that could adapt to an all vegan diet. Does that obligate us to? I don’t think so. For a few reasons.

1. Best easiest source of necessary protein for the last few thousand years has been meat raised through farming, or gathered by hunters. We’ve built entire cultures around that all over the world. You really think it’s ethical to go to every culture on earth and tell them to “stop eating the food your culture developed over centuries.” 

2. if we all just stopped eating meat at this point..  can we even imagine what the ecological impact would be? What would happen to the tens of thousands of meat and dairy cows? Would they all just die? Would some survive? Would they move into non native environments and cause havoc? While I do blame humanity for its egregious interference in nature, that doesn’t mean I think we can just stop.

AskFeminists,"A concept of absolute consent would imply that once given, it could never be revoked. You are correct that such a thing does not exist-- there is not any scenario where someone, before engaging in sexual or other activity with you, could consent and be guaranteed to *never* change their mind or their feelings about whatever occurs afterwards-- whether there are subsequent sexual encounters, the relationship progresses over time (or does not), or the own individuals feelings about the context in which they gave consent can be guaranteed not to change.

Your experiences, as difficult and unfortunate as they are, do not render, whole cloth, the *practice* of asking or offering consent in itself meaningless or relevant, however. 

Relationships are made up of many different components. Along with sexual commitments (which should include and require consent)-- there are other commitments you make in regards to open and honest communication, to sharing and honouring each other boundaries... etc. etc. It sounds like your marriage (and the relationship and commitments with your spouse) began breaking down some time ago. The primary issue between you and your wife is not a lack of enthusiastic consent in regards to sex with your partner- scheduled or unscheduled-- that is just the particular way the other ways your marriage has already lost trust, respect, and commitment manifesting. 

As to how can two people ever trust each other? Relationships are about risk-- you might mitigate risk, by taking other actions outside of sex to build and affirm trust-- like communicating, offering reciprocity in aid and support, etc. But it's a fundamental part of the human condition that you can't ever truly know, have power over, or surety in regards to another person. It sounds like you have some pre-existing issues with trust in relationships, and that your current relationship is also doing harm to your sense of confidence in both yourself and others-- I cannot recommend getting solo therapy, to deal with those issues with people who are trained to do so, enough.",1615658373

AskFeminists,"I'm not the commenter, but have been learning more about nonmonogamy and grew up queer in a conservative home and city for the majority of my life. 

I think the issue the commenter above is talking about is that the man in the relationship is the one allowing his partner to only be with other women, and this is after she had sex with someone else without his prior consent (cheating). This dynamic is not healthy. Healthy relationships and partners are supposed to work as a team, not have one snatch control while the other isn't looking or assert dominance to get control. The need for control is a red flag that the relationship can get toxic and that's without exploring alternatives to monogamy. It happens on queer spaces too and the perpetrator is significantly more likely to be a man even then.

Now, in a relationship where a an mspec person wants to explore and grow in their sexuality, if both parties agree on what the boundaries are and safety practices, then it can be very rewarding. It takes a lot of open communication, scheduling, and consideration.

My understanding is that “Karen” is not about all women, it’s about white women. It fits into the ideas of Becky and Miss Anne, and can be a commentary on white women using their relatively high ranking in the (white supremacist)  patriarchy to abuse and oppress anyone who is not also a white woman or man. Is this anti-feminist? I think that’s a discussion that can’t happen without examining the intersectionality of the brand of feminism in question.

I usually walk quite fast and it's not a big issue for me to just avoid people in general and go a little bit out of my way to keep distance between them and me. Their perception of me can't change, but then again they have every right to not feel safe in the fucked up world we live in.",1615682063

AskFeminists,"I'm definitely not saying men don't sexualize breasts.

But from my perspective I would say the people who sexualize breasts the most are the women I know. 😬

I'm absolutely not saying that when a woman tries to look attractive in whatever way that she's automatically doing it for other people, but of all the people I know, the Ladies I know are the ones figuring out ways to make their breasts a sexy feature explicitly for others. Contouring, push up bras, bra inserts, water bras, and actual breast surgeries that are cosmetic only. 
Again, I don't think there is a single thing wrong if women want to do this, but I do think that the people continuing and perpetuating the sexualization of breasts in the practical sense is SEEMINGLY women. 
I mean look at Victoria's Secret, not much diversity and really not much size inclusion, and I have only ever seen women in there as I walk by. I don't have a comprehensive male perspective on this and I would definitely love it. 🤷‍♂️
On the subject of their practicality for breastfeeding only, I believe human women are the only mammals that have very visible breasts outside of when they are lactating. I'm not sure how that can be used in arguments but it's a very, very interesting subject!",1615681389
AskFeminists,"I have... no clue what your point is.

You're saying that men sexualising breasts isnt the reason we can't be topless. And then go on to make the point that the *real* reason we can't be topless... is because young boys will sexualise our breasts?????

So you're making every single woman adapt their actions for the sake of a few immature boys who havent been taught to act appropriately around female breasts.

Do you not think that maybe allowing women to have their breasts out in public would work towards desexualising and normalising them so that boys don't see them as ""magical"" (because they aren't magical, they're ordinary secondary sex characteristics like facial hair).

When wealthy men or women displayed their wealth by owning a car, that was considered fine. When a middle class man went to work in his car, that was considered fine. But a middle class woman discovering new freedom in her car? Can't have that, that will both lower the prestige of car ownership, and challenge the social norm of the stay at home wife!

Personally, I'd say that her initial action of cheating was unethical, for sure. I think the boyfriend's differential attitude to her having extra-relationship sex with women vs. men is absolutely borne of societal misogyny, but also, his feelings are still his feelings.

Once a relationship is well established, sex does not need to have 100% enthusiastic consent all the time.  But at that point, you should have a level of communication and trust where you can be certain if they truly are consenting or not.  If that level of trust is not there for you OP, then yeah, you should be revoking your own consent until it's back and you can be confident of her intentions.

The rest of it is more of a philosophical question than a feminist one...OP got a little lost in their own head I think and is really asking whether or not it's possible to completely trust someone to ever be completely honest with you.

AskFeminists,"a) The sexualisation is not intrinsic to body parts. Note that in the same societies, different parts get sexualised at different times and within different subcultures. There are cultures where nudity and toplessness are completely normalised  (the Victorians found ankles very arousing , and some people find feet arousing, and I find nudity completely not arousing).  


b) If what is sexually arousing is defined by whether you can give yourself certain neural responses, then since people can get themselves off, orgasms wouldn't be sexual or arousing (this absurdity should make you see the flaw in your logic).   


c) Men sexualising breasts, and having that institutionalised, is *exactly* why I cannot go topless. I didn't have tits before I transitioned, and now I do, and them making them sexual and obscene is why I risk arrest in many parts of the world.  They're just tits in most contexts.",1615672215

Another counterpoint: a country that has communal public bathing, Japan. Women bathe naked with children. Entire families bathe naked together. There's nothing inherently sexual about the body, it's about how you behave with your body or how others project their feelings about your body. I grew up with family members frequently topless, and I certainly was not traumatized by it.

Part of objectification is the mystification of it. Ooo, what's under the ladies blouse??? Mystical magical breasts that we might get to touch if we get blessed! What wondrous sights hidden from view! When in reality, as someone who goes to a women's only nude spa regularly, breasts are pretty boring. And I'm sexually attracted to women!

I have multiple cases of full blown sexual assault yet my memory registered it as not a big deal, and hilarious yet humiliating adventure.

AskFeminists,"The fundamentals of consent are broadly:
1) Capacity of the person giving consent- the person should be of sound mind, not drunk/high to the point of no control, they should be old enough to give consent, and they should be in a physical state to give consent whether verbal or by gestures.
2) The mode of consent- while it can be both gestures/verbal, it's important that the consent is fundamentally express i.e given by their own volition, it should be complete and not conditional.
3) The consent should be free- there should be no coercion, manipulation, fraud, undue influence of power/position, mistake or misrepresentation in the way consent has been obtained. There should be a meeting of the minds, so to speak. Every person involved should know clearly what is being consented and it should have no such coercive tactics in play, making the consent free and absolute.

Sometimes the conditions can be such that although a person does not expressly say a verbal ""no"" (due to influence, power dynamics, sexual dynamics, personal history, trauma etc) it does not amount to a ""yes"" either. 
""Enthusiastic consent"" is term that is basically used to imply that instead of looking for a simple lack of ""no"" there should be a presense of ""yes"", whether it is verbal, or by gestures like positive body language. When there is power imbalance, coercion etc, there will most likely be no express verbal consent and no positive gestural consent via body language, emotional display etc.

While it's true, people may not completely trust or even know each other, consent on its own has nothing to do their interpersonal relationships, history or even future. Consent should not be seen has a reflection of people's lives or relationships as a whole, consent should be seen as a fundamental part in every single sexual act that any people engage in, whether they have known each other for one day or one entire lifetime.

And a lot of women do get professional help: that doesn't change the perceived sense of danger, especially when we've been told all our lives to change our behavior to be safe. Don't drink too much, don't wear revealing clothes, don't be out late, etc. We hear that from childhood on throughout our lives, and when women experience violence, they are often blamed for it.

If he can't wrap his brain around that, he's probably a lost cause. I wouldn't want to be friends with someone like that.

I think this is an interesting case. If we stop telling women to fear men in order to be safe, would the fear go away? 

It seems like the fear is based in perceived extent of harm: (fear of escalation, violence, and impact), rather than the frequency. So even if it almost never happened, the perceived fear would likely not change.

Like the driving vs airplane analogy. Deaths from driving are more frequent, but if you get into a car crash, some people might survive. An airplane crashes less frequently, but when it does, it’s catastrophic.

Look up the Tulsa race massacre. Because white women didn't feel safe (after an alleged r*pe by a Black man on a white woman), a whole thriving Black community was bombed and hundreds of people killed, their bodies thrown into the river.

AskFeminists,"Whenever I hear arguments in favour of covering up the human body because *insert body part* is inherently sexual, I think of three things. First, no body part is inherently sexual, even sexual organs. They are sexual in a sexual setting, but outside of that, they are just another body part. Is washing your genitals sexual? Not unless you make it. Peeing? Not unless you are a) into that and b) it's already a sexual situation. Is scratching your genitals because they itch sexual? Nope, sometimes they just itch. Teenagers get hardons out of nowhere, in public, in the middle of the day, and that's not even sexual. It just happens. Puritanical views if the body has reduced them to their sexual function, but they are not solely sexual. They become sexual.

Second, I think of nudism. People are literally fully naked in front of each other, all day, and it's not a constant orgy and children are not scarred by seeing naked people around them. Nudist colonies are only awkward if people make it sexual (i.e. creeps). Not to say it is impossible for nudism to be problematic but, in and of itself, being naked isn't even sexual. It's hiding bodies that make them so enticing when they are revealed. And I'm saying that as someone who does not partake in that lifestyle at all.

And third, can men's nipples be sexual? They can be. A LOT of men like their nipples played with during intimacy, yet we don't freak out over men's nipples. Ask yourself this question: why can men's breasts sometimes be sexual, but women's breast are seen as always sexual?",1615689745

AskFeminists,"&gt;walking at night is safer as a woman than for a man, yet women tend to report more fear. 

There's a lot to unpack there, but there are a few immediate problems with using this as the basis for changing your behavior:

1. The fact that women report more fear may be what's driving them to avoid situations that would make them victims of violent crime. If women are more cautious, their lower representation in crime statistics makes sense. 
2. Women are, manifestly, harassed more often in public than men in terms of stalking, cat-calling, etc. Basically every woman reports having had these experiences, usually often. So fearing men following them (and potentially escalating into harassment) is totally rational. Women are almost certainly more likely to be harassed randomly than men are to be victims of random crime. 
3. Notoriously, female victims of sexual assault are often distrusted and even blamed...male victims of robbery not so much. So women may feel they lack a kind of safety net (police, support from acquaintances afterwards) that men take for granted.",1615687671

It sucks, because it is valuable and necessary to label, highlight, and discuss the racism of white women, but one of the tools that women of color developed in order to draw attention to that discussion has been turned into a misogynist dog-whistle for any insufficiently-subservient woman.

AskFeminists,"I think the key thing here is that ""safety"" is a strange standard for what could be considered acceptable behaviour. We could easily imagine an alternative situation where instead of coincidentally heading the same way, a man has decided to actively follow after a woman walking home in the dark, for whatever reason - maybe he's seen her around and is curious where she lives. Let's also say that he has no intentions of doing anything or even approaching her, i.e. he's not actually ""dangerous"". In such a situation, we can easily say that she is, in fact, still perfectly ""safe"". But just about anyone would still recognize this behaviour as completely fucked up. Because she has no way of knowing his intentions, and because the distress it would cause is already harmful all by itself, regardless of safety.",1615686304

Everyone thinks they're ""less than"" sometimes and judge themselves much more harshly than others probably do.

I definitely think you can be a feminist while being very critical of and struggling with the beauty bias in the world. 

But I can also see that it can feel unfair and make you cynical.

I think the biggest flaw I see in your internalized logic, is the idea that people are interchangeable. Your reasoning sounds like: Your personality is worth 50 points, and the other guys is also worth 50 points. But his face is more symmetrical, and so women will choose the other guy - or dump you when they can find a guy with a better calculated value. 

That argument is very reductionist - it leaves out a lot of real life details. You could compare it to a large scale research study. But to apply it to yourself also reduces you, it becomes a kind of self-objectification. It reduces you from a real life person with hopes, interests, passions and aspirations to ""a carrier of value"". That also encourages you to objectify other people in the same way.

I think the best way to step out of that system, is to take steps to improve your own self-esteem and self-love. Not because hot chicks will automatically slide into your DMs after that. But because it allows to you step outside of a system of objectification in which happiness is highly conditional and hard to attain and keep.

AskFeminists,"&gt; You think you’re describing a feeling, something that resides inside an individual. But we’re trying to tell you it’s not just how women see the world: it’s a reality that affects half of the population in a specific way, at the hands of the other half of the population.

  


I hear you. And I am saying it's both.

  


We are living in a time that is virtually the safest in recorded human history. And yet if you.ask a woman from 10 years ago vs a woman today they are gonna tell you that they feel unsafe.

  


It's a reality perceived by one half of the population by the bad acting members of the other half. Members that the other half fears too by the way.

  


  


  


&gt; Women are telling you that they feel unsafe. You say you see women feeling unnecessarily unsafe. Why wont you take women at their word and accept that what they feel reflects reality? 

  


Because it doesn't. Because to accept them at their word requires me to see the other half of the population as predators, or as schrodingers rapists. I am a person who doesn't even see people as schrodingers theives.

  


&gt; What you consider idealistic (changing norms) and realistic (women gaining agency) is only your opinion. What many communities have made possible is the former and people who have privilege only ever really consider the latter, because the latter doesn’t require relinquishing some privilege.

  


Have you ever considered the fact that you asking for help... no demanding that we change the way we do things in our daily lives to make strangers feel safer comes across to the half that you are describing as entitled?

  


Violence defines the world we inhabit. It colors everything from our friendships to our enemities, to even how we need to deal with assholes in traffic. We have learnt to live with a constant low level of anxiety with a constant low level of threat hanging over our heads, that's the price of our freedom.

You can have it too. No one made concessions or tried to make us feel safer or welcomed. ""The world is a hostile place"" - that's our reality.

  


And on top of that many women expect us to do more to help them feel safer, not only simply things like crossing the road or make ourselves less threatening than we are... which is all very doable. But then they also expect us to do things like speak up when cat calling or everlasting occurs.

  


Do they not consider that by doing so we subject ourselves to the possibility of an escalation.

Eveteasers are assholes but they are unlikely to escalate to groping women, how ever what do you think happens when a 5'6"" Manlet calls them out on it? Don't you think they are liable to feel emasculated and required to retaliate with physical force to regain it?

  


As a group women feel entitled to feel safe, to ask the other half of the population to help them, but I am not gonna help them until the stakes are high enough for me to try and help (the lack of my help leading to assault or rape), do you know why ? Because men deserve to to feel.safe too, but we know that we are only as safe as we make ourselves.

  


It was a huge point of contention for a post on r/menslib. I recommend reading it. The users there make this point a while lot better than I am able to.

  


I am a 5'6"" guy which is midling in my country. I am stronger than I look, but even so I am not gonna interfere with an eveteading incident, because off the top of my head I know of 5 instances over the last month where a man was assaulted for protesting , one stabed with a knife, (he died) .

I told this multiple times, humans are complicated. They have a wide range of preferences or qualities they are attracted to. 

In a way, you actually helped me. Because I needed to formulate arguments against you, who believes in all the things I want to challenge. One person's meat is another person's poison.

AskFeminists,"A quick look at the study shows that it is very badly designed. As I mentioned, attraction has many facets. Without taking those into consideration, I don't think we can get comprehensive results. The study only included penis models, not humans. Don't you think that there would have been different results if there was a guy attached to that penis? There could many influences then. For example, a woman might have a strong attraction to certain physical features, and that person might have a smaller penis. Do you think that the woman will now choose that guy, just because of the penis? Don't you think that results may be even varied if you gave descriptions of each guy? Say like one guy might have a massive penis, in the picture, but is described to touch women inappropriately. Wouldn't that influence the result?

The point is, men are not walking dildo, and have various traits and personalities. Women are not hivemind and different environments breed attraction to different traits and qualities. Whether these particular researchers believe it or not, there are many studies that concluded that there is a strong social factor to attraction. And people are beyond their penises and vaginas, so attraction can vary.",1615713434

AskFeminists,"I clearly directed the question towards feminists. 

I don't know if you are a man, woman, or non-binary, but let me tell you that this post is very much directed to questioning/challenging those notions. Besides, have you critically seen the study? How many participants were there? Did they take into account social conditioning? What were the ages of the women in the study? What are the mean response and the standard deviation? What are the dependent and independent variables? Are there any other studies against this? 

It is easy to claim studies concluded something. But there are many factors that might prove those theses/theories wrong. Especially when it comes to social psychology, and issues like attraction which have significant influence such as social conditioning, environment, previous experiences, etc. Many racists want to prove certain races are unattractive by ""science."" But they are not objective truths. Attraction can have many facets. Despite never being in a relationship, I did like several women who weren't conventionally attractive completely because they were amazing people. Similar studies like you said would say that I shouldn't be attracted to them, but I was. 

All I want to say is, if you cannot critically think and argue about the claims you are supporting, especially in cases of science, then begin doing that instead of trolling on the internet.

The backlash you're experiencing is the same kind feminists get when they refuse to coddle men. As patriarchy is a social system, there are also women part of enforcing it. Hence the negative reactions from women to your actions. 

It's generally in the interest of patriarchy for men to not step up to bigotry, to just let it slide, for them to only be interested in protecting a woman in case of sexual desires.

AskFeminists,"I’m glad you brought this up because it does highlight why this discussion can be so difficult. It’s so critical to not tear one oppressed group down while trying to prop up another. It’s further complicated because “Karen” has definitely been coopted and used in misogynistic ways, but that’s not how it started. There are a lot of shades of racism, blatant racism, aversive racism, ignorant racism etc and this manifests in a lot of different ways in different situations. When Black folx describe a recurring way in which white women can and do abuse their privilege, often in ways that play off of their own oppression in the structure of patriarchal white supremacy (see “Central Park Karen” as others have mentioned) it’s important to listen to that. Naming things is a powerful way to highlight structural dynamics, but of course a single word or name like “Karen” is going to be reductive and can easily lose its nuance or unfortunately be coopted. In my experience, it’s So. Hard. To tell people they’re racist and expect them or others to listen. Having terms to describe how they are doing that helps. I’m not sure I support the ongoing use of “Karen” given the points you’ve made, but there’s a lot to be learned from its origin. There is no real male equivalent for “Karen” because in these discussions, white man already tells us plenty about a person’s privilege. And I would point out that in pop culture you *do* find references to Steve, Chad, Dan, Kevin, etc. I do think that the reason they haven’t caught on the same way as “Karen” is because of misogyny.",1615704544

AskFeminists,"I do find it ridiculous. I just don't see what the fact that a body part is considered ""sexual"" or not has anything to do with whether or not it's considered socially appropriate. There's no inherent reason why twerking is sexualized, but it is still considered inappropriate. Same goes for being topless. It just seems like a misguided appeal to authority in the form of biology.",1615698144
AskFeminists,"The status quo, or everything as it currently is, IS misogynistic in that our institutions are built by men for men.  Welcome to r/askfeminists.",1615698042
AskFeminists,"&gt;First, no body part is inherently sexual, even sexual organs. They are sexual in a sexual setting, but outside of that, they are just another body part.

This 100%.

Also lowkey reminds me of a story about a woman showing her boyfriend how she puts in a tampon. And after she inserted it he asked ""why didn't you moan?"" lmao. Like, just because something involves a part of the reproductive system, doesnt mean it will elicit a secual response?",1615697894
AskFeminists,"Because if breasts aren't inherently sexual, then why should we have to cover them up?

Imagine if women decided that men's hands are sexual. That they can't be shown in public because that's obscene. So men have to buy £30 gloves to cover them up, gloves that are uncomfortable and dig in and leave marks on their skin. Male celebrities get harrassed by tabloids and have abuse levvied at them when the gloves accidentily slip and show a bit of hand. And then men say ""fuck it, i don't want to wear gloves anymore. Hands aren't even inherently sexual."" And women reply ""that doesnt matter because *we* find them sexual, so you have to do what we say and cover up.""

If you find the above senario ridiculous, then you can probably understand why the oversexualisation of breasts is ridiculous.",1615697448
AskFeminists,Exactly or to be informed that what they're doing is a problem and insist that it isn't.,1615697211
AskFeminists,"Depends I guess. I adore shit schlock movies from the 70s-80s(grew up on mst3k) and they are usually filled with stuff that wouldn't fly today. But that's me laughing at the movie rather than along it. More contemporary stuff like friends and the rest, I just find that extremely unfunny. A really good example is everybody loves Raymond and agreed watching a few episodes I was like okay he's a shit husband and now what? Are we gonna build on that. The funny was nowhere to be found",1615697181
AskFeminists,"OP said breasts are to some degree sexual body parts, and I was explaining why I think that’s not the case, at least outside of patriarchal social norms.",1615696657
AskFeminists,"The word is sexist.

Why is there a gender-specific insult for racism when racism isn't gender-specific and women aren't more racist than men? Why is there no male equivalent insult? 

The idea the word is about calling around racism is a pretense in the first place -- it's literally just used as a synonym for the word bitch at this point and men on the internet are loving the fuck out of it to use it to harass women in situations that have no relation whatsoever to race.

If you want to call out a racist, just call a racist a racist. You don't need to  bring in and weaponize the preexisting cultural attitude of contempt towards women.",1615696472
AskFeminists,The thick of it is excellent. Peter capaldi is great as Malcolm tucker. The side characters are pretty fun too,1615696365
AskFeminists,"Not sure what the fact that ""breasts are not inherently sexual"" has anything to do with it though? There are a lot of countries where a woman's shoulders are shoulders, arms, chest, legs, etc. are sexualized and considered inappropriate.",1615696146
AskFeminists,"I dont know. I was an activist for years and pulled quite a few women out of the hole, but i was also very experienced in debating these talking points by that point. For every anti-feminist talking about there is at least 1, probably more, excellent counters, and since most anti-feminist youtubers are terrible people it is usually easy to find proof that they don't know what they are talking about.


Without knowing her exact positions and reasoning it's hard to tell you what you could say.

And you should not feel weird telling wrong people they are wrong. Like i said, i pulled quite a few women out of the anti-feminist rabbit hole and from my experience, as long as you are not condescending or rude it should be okay. You do need to know what you are talking about though and she has to be open to discussing it.

Her huffing at your evidence is not a good sign though.",1615695733
AskFeminists,"Then he’s not believing women about their own experiences, and actually going as far as to pathologize it.",1615695699
AskFeminists,"From a feminist perspective everything is misogynistic given enough thought.

  


That would be a fun drinking game game though.",1615695629

AskFeminists,i think people should stop 'searching for things to be offended by',1615695598
AskFeminists,"I would tell all the people with opinions on it to write them down, like really get into it, 4 pages back and front on their opinion, why they think what they do and any far reaches of thought this takes them to. I would then instruct these people to fold this information up as small as it will go (so its got nice pointy hard edges) and then proceed to place this with all the other worthless shit they produce by inserting it up their asses. WHO CARES IF SOME DUDES FINDING GIRLS FUCKING OTHER GIRLS HOT, yeah maybe shes a bit of a dick for cheating on him but obviously he could deal with it and still be happy with her so who cares.",1615695436
AskFeminists,"From a feminist perspective, indifference is misogynistic. Enjoy being part of the norm, but it’s not feminist.",1615695412
AskFeminists,"No problem. And I do appreciate you being considerate and also asking about the specific reasons. Most men don't really see what women go through on a daily basis in public so it can be hard to conceptualize. 

For reference, I was first followed by a man when I was 10 with my aunt. He followed us for several blocks and eventually we hid in a cafe to escape him. When I worked my first job as a teenager I was cat called between 6 and 12 times (no exaggeration) on each lunch break when I only walked 1-2 blocks. I bring male chaperones to bars with me but if the guy I'm with goes to the bathroom a man will immediately come to me to hit on me. This was compounded with sexual assaults I had experienced (anything physical was from people I knew) and I eventually shaved my head and would leave the house only wearing baggy sweats to avoid street harassment. My story isn't unique. Most women mentally consider their entire night as far as transportation goes before they wear a cute outfit. It's a constant thought process for most women. So it's really nice when men who don't know you are also considerate on your behalf",1615695326
AskFeminists,"You behave like the world is genderless because you have the freedom to do so. Women cannot afford to do so because of all the men who target them for benign women. So that’s your right; know that what you’re choosing serves to maintain the status quo, where men walk around with more freedom than women.",1615695318
AskFeminists,Exactlyyyy such a good point,1615694951

AskFeminists,"Technically sociopathy is not considered an acceptable term in psychology and is strictly a criminal justice/criminology  label.

Traits commonly associated with ""sociopathy"" or ""psychopathy"" can fall into the category of antisocial personality disorder, but the terms are considered quite offensive within psychological/mental health circles.",1615694799
AskFeminists,Lol right,1615694526
AskFeminists,"&gt; It won’t convince him because he believes it not his fault women have this fear.

How incredibly flawed is this logic, by the way. ""I'm not responsible for \_\_\_\_\_\_ happening so I'm just not going to give a shit about it and potentially harm people with my ignorance and behavior with no remorse.""

I haven't heard a single good argument to support his side of this, at all.",1615694519

AskFeminists,Thank you for helping me see it in a different light.,1615694372
AskFeminists,Ok thank you for this viewpoint.,1615694354
AskFeminists,Your friend sounds...lovely.  I'm lying.  He sounds like a jerk.,1615694324
AskFeminists,Ok thank you for your viewpoint.,1615694314
AskFeminists,The issue is we still *feel* like we're being followed. Most women have trauma of a sexually violent or harassment nature. Many women have been followed or harassed by strangers. I don't know many women who have never been cat called or followed by a stranger. Many women have PTSD ( being a woman is actually listed in the DSM as a risk factor for PTSD). You wouldnt walk through a room full of veterans banging pots and pans because you might trigger a trauma response from someone. Being conscious of making women feel safe is similar. You don't know if the woman you're trailing has PTSD from being stalked by a stranger or some other trauma that makes her hypervigilent of men,1615694279
AskFeminists,"This is a great point. I agree that white women who use their privilege as a weapon should be called out for it. I remember the story of the woman who was in the park and she called the police on a black man who was bird watching. At the time “Karen” seemed to refer to that kind of racist behavior specifically from white women. Now, it’s a term that seems to have misogynistic undertones that are hard for me to explain but I know it when you see it.",1615694185
AskFeminists,"I think it’s awesome of you to take the time to explain him btw. As you said, he doesn’t care because he doesn’t feel the issue has anything to do with him. So bring back the point of view on someone he technically should be more concerned about like his girlfriend, sister, mom.",1615694141
AskFeminists,"Seriously. And the edits about his friend's girlfriend? Cringe. ""Oh poor me, I can't decide who I agree with.""",1615693957
AskFeminists,"You are incredibly biased. Your friend is sexist and lacks empathy, and you stand by him in that and even question if you are not convinced by his views yourself... You even have your own sexist biases to contend with judging on the things you've said here.

It's more than talking about politeness when you looking at his comment about men experiencing more violence to divert from the fact that women overwhelmingly experience more sexual violence. Let alone the fact that it's men that primarily perpetuate all forms of violence.

It's like that one-liner. ""Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them."" If you can't recognize the difference in experiences between men and women and at least have some modicum of empathy about it, you're dealing with misogyny then.",1615693824
AskFeminists,This stuck out to me too. It's one thing to not go out of your way to do it. It's another to try to convince your guy friends that they shouldn't,1615693802
AskFeminists,"Dude, someone who says things like your friend is not a cool guy. Maybe to YOU, but his attitude towards others puts him in huge a\*\*hole territory.   
I'm so glad my partner and his mates are the types to stand up against the discrimination and oppression of others, they treat women, LGBTQ and POC's with common decency. Restores my faith in humanity that decent men do exist.",1615693748
AskFeminists,"&gt;I think this is an interesting case. If we stop telling women to fear men in order to be safe, would the fear go away?

No because all women know a woman, if not many women, who has(/have) been raped. You asked somewhere else if men had power to change this dynamic. Yeah, if they stopped assaulting women. Men are the primary perpetrators of violence against all genders. Ya'll have the power to stop that by not committing crimes. Until that happens... until a girl is born into a world where she doesn't hear about her relatives or friends getting assaulted or isn't assaulted and harassed herself, women won't stop fearing men.",1615693540
AskFeminists,"I mean that's a whole other thing. Racism and sexism unfortunately do coexist.
Till and the victims of the tulsa race massacre were victims of racism justified by white men through sexism.

You say it as if it was the white women doing the lynching, when it was due to white men being mad at black men (in tills case Bryant's husband, in the massacre hundreds of white men) for not knowing their place and infringing on their property.",1615693477
