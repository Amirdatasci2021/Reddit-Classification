Men get treated better. Men have more privelage, higher wages, more expectations of equality, more opportunities, less (not non existent, but less) expectations of physical and sexual violence against them, less blame or consequences for physical and sexual violence, to name a few differences.

Feminism,"*Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism?*

There is a ~ genus-species relation between egalitarianism and feminism.

Feminism is a type of egalitarianism - specifically, one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender. ""Equalism"" or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline, an actual coherent protest movement; we can't actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history/academic texts/produced scholarly works/ideological currency/etc. What you have instead is an umbrella term, an attribute of several schools of thought (a ""trend of thought""), without actually being a school of thought in and of itself. Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal (basically, the most general formulation of social equity) which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought/actual social movements.

Therefore, movements for the rights of various social groups (women, men, children, LGBT, ethnic groups, people with disabilities, etc.) are all components/specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual/activist/concrete terms.

A similar answer can be given for feminism‚Äôs relation with *gender equality*.

Regarding feminism‚Äôs relation with *humanism*: humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective, while feminism has no such precondition (there exist both atheist feminism, and feminist theology).

*Feminism's relation with the men's movement*

The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality. As such, we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence, and the legitimacy, of men‚Äôs issues, and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues.

*Regarding the claim ‚Äúif feminism was an egalitarian movement, there wouldn‚Äôt be a need for a men‚Äôs rights movement‚Äù*

Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements, ideologies and theories. If we are speaking theoretically, then yes, feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men's issues as well. If we are speaking practically, then everyone is free to get involved (or not) in a certain issue, regardless of how strongly they feel about it. Lack of involvement does not mean opposition; by and large, all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis, and it is completely up to them to decide how much time, energy and money they want to invest, and in which issue - without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A, but not on issue B. Most people don't get involved in anything at all, those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement, regardless of their area of action.

That's my point. The OP and many others like you demand that literally every single man act in a certain way? That's absurd. There are many ways to effect change and support without following your demands.

&gt;Misandry does not even exist,

Yikes.

&gt;I just know you're racist in the way you refer to black people as ""blacks"" as well as stereotyping Muslims as terrorists

Honestly, I can see why you would say this because it does feel a little rough coming off the tongue. But the verbiage has been very fluid over the recent years, and there really isn't an accepted term yet. People of color, colored people, black people, blacks, African American, etc. all offend someone for some reason. Know that I acknowledge that, but saying I'm a racist because of that is a way to try and dehumanize me so you don't have to address my argument or simply ignore it as invalid.

The Muslim thing was also part of the point I'm making. Reading comprehension will tell you that I don't believe Muslims are terrorists. The statement is terrible and very bigoted. However, I simply crafted it using the exact language of the original post to make a point.

Feminism,"&gt; Judging by the number of repeat clients, it would seem ""which"" is their type. 

This is pretty well researched in the field of psychology. It's an aspect of trauma bonding; a person within a traumatic relationship -- abusive, harassing, sexual violence, anything like that -- will sometimes become dependent on the person abusing them. Which can happen for however many reasons, often gaslighting or simply not having a way out -- it's safer to become dependent than to completely isolate yourself, and to put yourself into a potentially more dangerous situation by leaving. You can just google trauma bond if you want it explained in better terms.

Once the victim of this leaves the relationship, however, they'll often get into relationships with other abusive people. Not because that's their 'type' -- which is just a sickening thing to say, honestly; nobody goes out of their way to find abusive partners -- but because the traits extant on their previous abusive partner that they 'fell in love with' will also be extant on new potential partners. The trauma bond doesn't magically go away when you leave a relationship, and if you became bonded to a person who was emotionally negligent and ignored your interests, then its easy to become attached to another person who is also emotionally negligent, because that's simply what love looks like in your traumatised experience.

It's also that abuse can decimate your self esteem. So you leave one abusive relationship, but can often feel like you deserved the abuse, or at least don't deserve true love, so you're willing to put up with other abusive relationships because at least then you're not alone with your own poor mental state.",1615720427

I think what you mean to say is something like ""not enough men"", meaning not enough men are calling out abusers, rapists, etc. because it doesn't affect them as much as it affects women. This is a message I think (practically) all men can get behind.

What‚Äôs going on is called the bystander effect. When you are taught cpr you are told that you can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúcall 911‚Äù to a crowd. No one will act. You need to say ‚Äúhey you in the white shirt, call 911‚Äù. The key is to transform it into a personal responsibility issue. Otherwise people of both genders will just stand idly by and watch. 

So in general we need to create a better society with more empathy and personal responsibility. We need to create people who will stand up and act against injustice when they see it; whether it be related to sexism, racism, income inequality, etc. And we need both men and women doing that if we want things to change. It‚Äôs so so hard as people are wired to be risk adverse and not sacrifice themselves for others. So rather than blast people for not standing up, we should frame it in a way where we praise the people who do. People like to be praised, and get defensive in the face of criticism.

#8 steps to avoid sexual assault

**SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION TIPS:**

1. *Do not put drugs in people's drinks.*

2. *When you see someone walking by themselves, leave them alone.*

3. *If you pull over to help someone whose car has broken down, remember not to sexually assault them.*

4. *If you are in an elevator and someone gets in, don't sexually assault them.*

5. *When you encounter someone who is asleep, the safest course of action is not to sexually assault them.*

6. *Never creep into someone's home through an unlocked door, window, or spring out at them from between parked cars, or sexually assault them.*

7. *Use the buddy system! If it is inconvenient for you to stop yourself from sexually assaulting someone, ask a trusted friend to accompany you at all times.*

8. *Carry a whistle. If you find that you are about to sexually assault someone, blow the whistle until someone comes.*

Feminism,"This list doesn‚Äôt do feminism justice as there‚Äôs barely any mentions of all the great ‚Äúside effects‚Äù of feminism, any LGBTQ issues/racism or intersectional issues in general (which admittedly the lack of used to be a huge problem within feminism and still is in large parts). It also doesn‚Äôt bring up anything about how feminism has progressed the discussion about gender in academia, something which I suspect is very undervalued. In other words, it focuses on specifically men‚Äôs issues that are not related to sexuality, race etc.

The intention is not to say feminism is equally about men as it is for women, it does certainly focus on women and is completely fine doing so, but the point is that the larger majority of the movement do care and that there is an expanding space within feminism that can and do talk about it. Solving men‚Äôs issues help women and vice versa (though my personal opinion is that it‚Äôs most effective to do both).

The goal is to give feminists an easy resource to refute claims about feminism not caring about issue x or men in general, hopefully, if the mods want to, add it to the sidebar, as well as asking for more sources/articles on how feminism helped men that you think should be in the list.

""But it's enough to keep us in a constant state of fear."" This is saying that all women are always in fear because of the potential of physical harm from men. 

I guess the question is who is the target audience. If it's meant to show people who don't understand what you explained it doesn't do a very good job. You however summed up what it should have said very succinctly. I think it's very easy to say men have many different types of power over women and almost all men have abused that power even if only minimally. It's much more relatable and less polarizing.

Feminism,"The difference is about power dynamics and what the agenda is. 

When it comes to violence against females: the group with less power is developing safety strategy based on frequent experiences so they don‚Äôt continue to be harassed by those in power.  The agenda is equality. 

In the case of refugees: the group with more power is bullying the group with less power using isolated incidences as examples. The agenda is political power (perhaps sprinkled with white supremacy).

Essentially, those in power should not abuse their power. As a corollary, it‚Äôs vitally important we all recognize where we, as individuals, are in power and where we aren‚Äôt. A same person can be in different categories for different issues (eg a male refugee is in power as a male and not in power as a refugee.

Feminism,"&gt;He will literally never do it again

That's incorrect. Is this anecdotal or just something you assume would happen if a guy was called out because that has NOT been my partners (m) experience.   
When he's called guys out for bad behaviour he's been met with denial, anger, brushed off and laughed at, ignored and very commonly gets ganged up on by other guys in the group who also feel attacked because they do/say the same shit. Any other time he gets along with these same guys really well, just not when he's calling them out.  
My partner sells cars and deals with a lot of sexism and monogyny among the salesmen and mechanics. An example of behaviour:   
Woman comes in to deal with the company for whatever reason, mechanics get all excited and start elbowing each other encouraging each guy to try get a look even if it's to go into an area they normally aren't in, talk about what they'd do to her, partner hears it and tells them their behaviour is gross and desperate, they laugh and tell him to basically F off, he's just emotional, white knight, SJW etc.   
Second example: Partner was out of town for training along with another dude when they go out for dinner before returning their hotel. Not long after partner learns this dude has a GF, he sees him on Tinder trying to hook up with multiple girls for the ONE night they're staying there. Partner calls him out gently saying ""that's messed up"".... it's been a year and half now and this dude hates his guts still and tries to mess with him.  
Last example: His friends he grew up with used the word ""gay"" to express annoyance, disgust, boredom etc. He decides to call his friend out on it one day, friend thinks it's a joke and not serious, keeps doing it multiple times until he realised partner is serious, sort of stopped doing it for a while before going back to it because he ""has gay friends who said it's ok, so it's ok"". Didn't have much to say when my partner responded back that both him and I are bi and my brother is trans and we're actually not ok with it. It's toned down now but it hasn't ""literally ever happened again"" like you want to believe.   


I'm not attacking you or your ideal situation because how freaking great would it be if men DID just need one talking to by their mates before they changed their behaviour? Sadly that's not realistic though. It takes people a while to accept they might be wrong about their long term behaviour and longer to rewire the brain (especially the older the person is). I mean, would you instantly change when 100 people never had an issue with your behaviour over 20 years but now one random friend is saying you're not actually the nice upstanding person everyone else said you were?",1615766185

There are obvious things that men say and do that range from inappropriate to harmful, but there are also things that may seem innocent but make a solid percentage of women feel uncomfortable or unsafe.

Feminism,"&gt;This is true though! Whenever I am walking in the dark I *am* always in a constant state of fear. Even it's not dark, and I need to walk past a group of men who are loitering, there is a baseline fear always. (My smart watch will show a sudden increase in heart rate.)

Ya I see what you mean there. It's an odd dichotomy that men can both make women feel safe and also fear just by being present. I was picturing walking with my wife. This would make her feel more safe. However I'm sure she would still have some fear walking past a group of men even if I were with her. Depending on the situation of course. Plenty of food for thought there.

Idk, I guess it was hard for me to identify with the core of what the post meant. And then I see comments like some in this thread basically saying that if someone doesn't get it now they never will. Well I didn't get it, and you helped me understand. I know there are people who fight against this and ""not all men"" is a tactic. I feel like at a glance it's a damn good tactic for someone who doesn't want to understand. Someone who doesn't want to examine themselves gets a free pass because they aren't violent. Now if they're not guilty why get introspective. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is thanks for not being dismissive and taking the time to articulate the subject.",1615780465

Feminism,"   Damn, you both have some great perspective here. I couldn‚Äôt agree more with everything you guys have said and I support women who think this, but just because I saw this brought up somewhere else I thought I‚Äôd help clear it up here.

   I should preface that I hate the argument that I‚Äôm about to talk about; its based on racist ignorance and doesnt take into effect the context of America‚Äôs negative history:

   People (not just women) have been trying to find a parallel to this point by arguing that they should similarly be more afraid of black men because they are more likely to commit crime in their area. The difference between the arguments is the context that Black people have disproportionately been forced in poorer neighborhoods and been oppressed in the workforce. Essentially the crime comes from living in poverty, not being black (e.g., a third variable). The context, as you said, seems to play a particularly large role in understanding these types of social points and the variables that cause the social distress. Do you have any thoughts on this? I would love to hear anyone‚Äôs perspective on how this point is/isn‚Äôt relatable to the point about men because I‚Äôve been arguing with racist family on Facebook about this these last few days; I sure could use more help because their sexism and racism is extremely stubborn and frustrating. 

   A follow up point, the argument used against men *may* be most applicable for anyone scared to walk down the street in an impoverished area at night. As a Brazilian/American I always avoid going to certain areas of my city in Brazil because they have more crime. These areas just happen to be the poorest areas. I by no means hate poor people though, similarly to how the argument against men doesn‚Äôt mean that women hate all men. There‚Äôs just strong information that informs our actions to be careful in these social situations.

   Even though the point above and the point about women fearing men seems fundamentally the same, there is a huge difference; again it‚Äôs context. The situation with poverty can be changed much faster than the situation with men; this is because of how the situation with poverty has been constructed differently. If the government just heavily funds these poorer communities we can simply eradicate these criminal differences without the need for more policing; which leads to more unnecessary death. I don‚Äôt give a shit if people think my idea is socialist BS (most Brazilian family hate me for thinking this way), they can suck my socialist butt. The situation with men cannot be fixed that easily.

I hope that all made sense! I‚Äôm tired af, writing two 25 page neuroscience research papers, studying for exams, and barely getting by financially. Life honestly makes me so depressed and exhausted but you all make me feel more confident that we‚Äôre moving in the right direction.",1615791507

Feminism,"*Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism?*

There is a ~ genus-species relation between egalitarianism and feminism.

Feminism is a type of egalitarianism - specifically, one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender. ""Equalism"" or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline, an actual coherent protest movement; we can't actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history/academic texts/produced scholarly works/ideological currency/etc. What you have instead is an umbrella term, an attribute of several schools of thought (a ""trend of thought""), without actually being a school of thought in and of itself. Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal (basically, the most general formulation of social equity) which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought/actual social movements.

Therefore, movements for the rights of various social groups (women, men, children, LGBT, ethnic groups, people with disabilities, etc.) are all components/specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual/activist/concrete terms.

A similar answer can be given for feminism‚Äôs relation with *gender equality*.

Regarding feminism‚Äôs relation with *humanism*: humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective, while feminism has no such precondition (there exist both atheist feminism, and feminist theology).

*Feminism's relation with the men's movement*

The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality. As such, we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence, and the legitimacy, of men‚Äôs issues, and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues.

*Regarding the claim ‚Äúif feminism was an egalitarian movement, there wouldn‚Äôt be a need for a men‚Äôs rights movement‚Äù*

Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements, ideologies and theories. If we are speaking theoretically, then yes, feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men's issues as well. If we are speaking practically, then everyone is free to get involved (or not) in a certain issue, regardless of how strongly they feel about it. Lack of involvement does not mean opposition; by and large, all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis, and it is completely up to them to decide how much time, energy and money they want to invest, and in which issue - without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A, but not on issue B. Most people don't get involved in anything at all, those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement, regardless of their area of action.

Feminism,"&gt;  It's üëè not üëè our üëè responsibility üëè to üëè be üëè your üëè caretakers üëè 

It'süëè ourüëè responsibilityüëè

&gt; Do women care when men are publicly, morally, and financially raped in  the family court system... when men are forced to give up half or more  of their current/ future earnings, their assets, their house, their  estate, their vehicle and custody of their children? 

Do you care when women are raped, sexual harassed or assaulted ? If you did, you would not make it all about you and creating strawmans when the topic in hand is about womens safety on the streets. Why are you talking about family courts when the issue at hand is about the harassment that women face ?

&gt; Do women care when men are raped/ sexually abused by women... or is it just played off as a joke 

Why are you making it out that women are the main perpetrators of male rape ?, the main perpetrators of male rape ARE OTHER MEN, as a guy you're more likely to raped by another man than you are falsely accused of rape by a woman.

&gt; This isn't about equality or justice.. it's about unjustly accusing a  specific group of people of being sexual predators when in-fact they  most certainly are not. Men don't owe you a thing. We don't owe you  protection, we don't owe you support, and we certainly don't owe you our  decency. 

This is absolutely abour equality and justice. 97% of young women 18-24 get sexual harassed, tens and thousands of rapes get reported and only a thousand get convicted the system itself is cruel and unjust towards victims, it should not be this way.

 No one is accusing all men to be predators (can you stop being so defensive and listen), there asking for your support and you can that by calling out sexist comments and jokes towards women and victims. Of course not all men are predators but if your complicit with that sort of behaviour (which your have shown by defensive), than you are part of problem regardless if your predator or not. 

As said before in the  UK 97% of young women 18 - 24 years old have sexual harassment, it's not women's job to fix this, it's a problem with men and it is our  responsibility to flattern that percentage.

Feminism,"Not sure if you read OP's question before it was deleted, but he specifically asked ""how is this [it's not all men, but we don't know which men] different from saying not all black people, but we don't know which black people."" I provided examples on how it's not the same and how that felt like an obfuscation and a dogwhistle. Comparing yourself to a maginalized and oppressed class when it's convenient to spin a narrative while ignoring the systematic injustices against said class versus the systematic advantages to another to smokescreen and counter an argument that men commit violent crimes against women and try to whattabout the argument into race baiting nonsense is really scummy to do on a board about women's issues and the amount of mental gymnastics required to say ""you aren't allowed to talk about your safety or the danger men pose because it's akin to racism"" is absurd.

As to your point, nobody is going to ask whether or not crossing the street to avoid a man is racist if that man is black versus white except for people fixated on that person's race, so your scenario is a bit confusing. Are you implying a woman who won't cross the street to avoid white men but will cross the street to avoid black men and women? Yes, that's racist. 

If a woman crosses the street to avoid a man, regardless of race, she's doing what society expects of her to ""keep herself safe"" as it always comes back to when a woman is harmed. ""She should have been more aware of her surroundings, she should have dressed differently, she should have crossed the street when she saw someone approaching her, she should have blah blah blah"" and other ways it's not the man's fault for harming her but her own fault for existing. But then people want to say ""not all men,"" despite it being a woman's fault for not suspecting it could be all men. It's an absurd circular argument that could go round and round forever and everyone is tired of hearing it. So to me and a lot of other people, it's all men and that's not an issue of privelage or class, it's a societal mandate issued by the government who refuses to prosecute men for their behaviors and teach women how to be afraid rather than teach men not to be abusers. Women must keep themselves safe, because the answer from policing and government agencies when they don't is ""she should have suspected all men and acted in accordance with that.""",1615802737

I take your point, that men who abuse women are generally more concerned about their reputation among men than what any woman thinks of them; e.g. a lot of rape culture is about focusing more on notches on bed posts and establishing an identity as a guy who can ""score"", than focusing on whether she really wanted to. 

I am afraid this isn't such a silver bullet, though. Maybe I've gone about it wrong, but it feels like I'm just as likely to be accused of something along the lines of ""white knighting"". It sucks.

Not all men but my mentally abusive boyfriend at the time that wouldn't stop asking until I said yes, It happened a lot. I often cried during the ""sex"" but he always kept going. (age 16)

Not all men but the man who spiked my drink that night, making me and a couple other women blind for a few hours. (I barely drank that night) Luckily my friends got me home safe. (age 17)

Same issues as second wave feminism where black and brown cis/trans women were underrepresented and had to make spaces for themselves adjacent to the core movement. My feelings about riot grrrl haven‚Äôt changed much in retrospect but there‚Äôs been some careful reconsideration of it in recent years. One good example was the touring exhibition Alien She, which did address some of the homogeneity of riot grrrl by including music, zines, and art by BIPOC makers.",1615824243

Feminism,"You mentioned that you don‚Äôt blame guys for this because they grew up with that. Implying that boys grow up thinking a certain way &amp; I feel like you giving it a negative connotation. In you negative experience with someone flirting with you, I don‚Äôt know how pushy the guy was so I can‚Äôt judge you on your personal experience but, if you handled it with an aggressive matter that it didn‚Äôt match the guys approach then I would consider it fiesty as well. But considering you were underage, he‚Äôs a dumbass. When it comes to jokes it just depends how much you take it personally? I‚Äôve had people roast me &amp; talk shit but, I dont care at the end of the day because their words don‚Äôt affect me üò© I don‚Äôt let it get to me. No matter what it is. But that‚Äôs me, it just depends how vulnerable you are to things like that. I mean if someone has an opinion of you being ‚Äúfeisty‚Äù it WAY DIFFERENT FROM ‚ÄúALL MEN SHOULD DIE!?‚Äù Those are two completely different scenarios, one of them could possibly potentially dangerous. Saying all men should die is threatening it could signal that the person could have a mental illness. I mean most hate crimes occur off such word like that . Calling someone ‚Äúfiesty‚Äù is not even close to ALL MEN SHOULD DIE!? Quite an extreme example. Hoodies, sweatpants, &amp; sandals are quite extreme tbh but, it doesn‚Äôt mean that there still ain‚Äôt some sort of parameter that both females &amp; males should follow. I mean at the end of the day, he‚Äôs a man. Men are attractive to women, SURPRISE! Obviously if he sees a model on ig he‚Äôs going to naturally be attracted to it. Of course, if he‚Äôs a heterosexual or bi. You can‚Äôt blame him for admiring female beauty. But see the difference is models are paid to do their job, &amp; there job is to look ‚Äúattractive.‚Äù I bet that he wouldn‚Äôt marry someone like that tho, because men are very selective with whom they want to be with for the rest of their life. So that‚Äôs where the whole, women should act like ladies comes into play. Because if your not a model, you shouldn‚Äôt be so explicit. That‚Äôs goes for both men &amp; women. I mean many men are upset of this feminist movement where they feel like they are being generalized as something they aren‚Äôt. I mean having women generalize that men are rapists, violators, &amp; sex offenders does hurt men to hear because not all of us participate in that horrendous behavior. Many of us do put a stop to it, &amp; call it out even if its with the ‚Äúboys.‚Äù Guys know when guys are being assholes, some of us do control &amp; tell the homies to back off. So when you got people coming at you or your type of people, it hurts. It does affect our gender to have to deal with such harsh claims.",1615863034

You basically answered it below that sentence, the only way you get to decommodifying animals and liberating the exploited, whether animal or human, is by first collapsing capitalism. If everyone became Vegan there‚Äôd still be very poor treatment of animals regardless because of industries that use animals for products, however, if capitalism falls, we are able to start a transition to decommodifying products and necessities, if you want to go further, we can move to growing meat in labs, we have already done it but capitalism prevents us from actually making it something to sell on the market.

Feminism,"I define sexual exploitation roughly as using another sentient being for their sexuality, reproductive system, or sexual capacity in some way, whether by overt or subtle force.  One need not actually derive pleasure sexually from the exploitation that they are forcing on someone else (e.g. farmers in the dairy industry do not necessarily get pleasure from it but they still do it). That definition can be refined but I am referring to essentially the ideal of viewing the sentient being as an object and specifically a sexual one. What I mean by women betraying other women: women who would themselves be at risk of the suffering I am referring to but still choose patriarchy over doing the right thing. Women who do FGM. Women - and everyone - who aren't vegan. Women who traffick other women (or men, or children, or whoever is being trafficked). Women who join in on misogyny when they are around male friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not referring to someone sexualizing themselves, but that may be a part of it. Mainly I was referring to the systemic exploitation of women and especially female animals. Capitalism may be a part of it, but non-veganism is the real issue. The solution is a paradigm shift in which women are viewed as legal persons and not as objects and a world in which animals have legal personhood and are not used as commodities in any way.",1615848361

Feminism,"The main reason that # is used is when generalizing statements are applied to men, eg:

*""men are killing women""*

Although the intent of the writer is probably to say ""some/too many men are killing women"", without that modifier in front the true meaning of the statement is that ""men in general"" are killing women. I think that men have a right to defend themselves from statements like the one above that generalize the entire gender. Generalizing statements are not really fair when applied to anyone, and usually result in unnecessary prejudice and judgement.

*""Not all ____ are _____, but enough of them are""* is not really a good rebuttal in my opinion. You cannot justify generalizations about groups of people just because they may be accurate in some cases. Try filling in those blanks with any other identity group besides men and it becomes clear why men respond defensively.

If a muslim hears: 
*""Not all muslims are wife-beaters, but enough of them are""*
used as justification in order to group them in with wife-beaters, they will defend themselves from that prejudicial generalization.",1615844417

My fiance is a good listener and tends not to give unsolicited opinions on stuff, but he has his blind spots and he can be pretty useless emotionally sometimes lol 

The important thing, I've found, is to just tell him when what he is doing (or not doing) isn't hitting the mark. For example, he tends to just want space when he is stressed out or emotional, so his tendency is to give me space (ie basically ignore me) when I'm emotional. 

At first, I found that incredibly hurtful, but over time we both learned that we just have different knee jerk approaches to things, so we need to ask for what we want. Now, when I'm emotional or upset and I want to be comforted, I just tell him that - ""I'm really upset right now and I want you to listen to me and comfort me"". It sounds so ridiculous, but it works and he does a great job! And when he needs space and I'm all up in his business trying to get him to tell me all his feelings, he asks me to please just let him do his thing.

In your case, I'd suggest you tell him that the way he responded made you feel dismissed, and that you want him to be more open to listening to your perspective on issues that affect you as a woman, like being afraid to walk alone at night. See how he responds to that. If he gets defensive, call him out on it and bring the focus back to you just trying to be heard and have your emotional needs met.",1615841754

It's a children's book (a picture book) so it doesn't exactly fit what you asked for (sorry) but I thought it might be nice as a gift idea.",1615868970
Feminism,"So if I'm understanding the question. Should people be more afraid in a financially poor high crime area? I think we can disregard race but obviously people will use that as an excuse to single people out. Violent crime is clearly one of symptoms of poverty, but it isn't a limiting factor. You don't need to be poor to have power and abuse it. I think maybe violence is the most accessable form of power. So in a poor community, violence, or at least the threat of it, is a quick and easy way to have power where you otherwise have very little. Of course you have the flip side where the powerful can use violence simply because they have power. I think the relationship is, all other things being equal (which they are not), most men have the availability to exerte power over most women in the form of and threat of violence. Maybe poor communities are the same in that regard. The greater potential for violence is baked into the society if you will. 

And, well not all fear is rational. We are certainly all afraid of things that will do us no harm. We are also unafraid of things that can or will do us harm. But the the perceived potential causes very real fear. Sometimes that fear is rooted in bad things like racism.

Anyway, don't listen to me too much. I've written and deleted this about four times now. My points feel week, and I'm not even sure I know what I'm saying.

Feminism,"I agree in some ways and not in others. First of all, everyone going vegan would result in animal exploitation industries to collapse and move to other alternatives since no one is paying for their services. And if a tipping point is reached and not everyone is vegan, they may be toppled sooner. Whether or not capitalism is also toppled may be irrelevant, and even if capitalism is toppled, that does not mean that the world will be vegan. Most anti-capitalists are not vegan and and most discussions about capitalism are done by people currently using animals as resources. They are willing to give up capitalism, but if asked, no way would they give up their animal products. The underlying beliefs that animals should be used as resources for food clothing, food and experimentation is not necessarily a capitalist idea, but rather, an imperialist and colonial idea that others should be slaves / might is right (capitalism comes later). Therefore, we need to get rid of the underlying speciesist belief first, and anti-capitalism cannot be divorced from that. AOC is against capitalism, and she's not advocating veganism as a moral baseline. Bernie Sanders is against capitalism, but no way would he give up ""his"" animal products.",1615910985

Feminism,"First of all, most developing countries in the world sustain themselves off of vegan staples such as beans, rice, legumes, grains. Meat and dairy is a luxury. Of course, there are some people who simply cannot access any good food at all, but that's not a why-veganism-is-flawed-argument, that's just another way in which our global food system is injust (to animals and to humans, clearly). As well, we currently have enough food to feed 10 billion people, but we choose to use those crops to fatten up animals whom we then murder - turning them into products that go primarily to well-off individuals in the west. If we care about the fair distribution of foods globally, veganism is the only coherent option. Can you go vegan? Are you vegan? Often, people point out someone else's disadvantage as a way to say ""well that person over there is disabled, poor, etc, and they can't go vegan, therefore I am not going to go vegan"". This is illogical and it's also selfish to use someone else's disadvantage to justify your own inaction. I agree toppling capitalism would be beneficial, but again, it's an ideology of non-veganism that is the primary issue. I agree humans need to be liberated as well but that also translates to ""We are humans who oppress and slaughter billions of animals, and I refuse to liberate those animals until I have my own freedom"". We can all choose to not oppress animals by being vegan, and most people can go vegan. (And if they can't go vegan, there are things that are not related to their diet that they can do: not go to circuses, not buy pets unless they're adopting, not buy fur and leather, etc). And yes, getting rid of speciesism is a huge step in the right direction because that would mean everyone or most of the world has gone vegan, and therefore, there simply isn't any demand for animal exploitation because everyone has declared ""I am vegan, I will not willfully participate in animal use"" and so all corporations and countries would be forced to change (of course it's more complicated). Again, there aren't many anti-capitalists who are vegan and those leading the political fight (Bernie, AOC, in the American case) would not further veganism since it's not something they perosnally practise.",1615981271

Disclaimer 2 electric boogaloo: I also haven't watched JoJo's Bizarre adventure I've seen the character designs though

I completely understand your point of view on JoJo's Bizarre adventure; the female characters are complete sexualisation and it's disgusting. But the male characters also incredibly sexualised (from what I've seen there might be some characters who aren't); they're all tall, muscular, jaw lines and confidant looking in posture and body language. Sexualisation goes both ways but from what I've seen one people will tend to only see it towards their gender. When I'm watching marvel films for example I honestly don't notice the sexualisation of the female characters but I see the sexualisation in the male characters eg, Captain America and Thor. Now I completely agree that JoJo's Bizarre adventure is too sexualised, but it goes both ways and I just ask that when anyone calls out sexualisation they take a look to see if the both genders are sexualised because most often both are.",1615967662
Feminism,"It's called (hetero)patriarchy. 

The vast majority of healthy population want a system based on social justice and that of course includes no abuse nor discrimination. However a minority wants to keep privileges and for that it's critical to them to abuse the rest and avoid the logical rebellion . This is very hard to sell as such, so the narrative works a lot better when it's sold as an abuse chain. 

So the 1% privileged class abuse the 99%, but to a percentage (1/2) of that 99% there is giving the other half to abuse. The first half are the men, and the second are women. To the men is told that to protect their privilege above women, they must also protect the 1% privilege. And most men bought it. Of course that 1% also spike it with more stuff like nativism, racial privilege, etc... but the thing is it's really easy to give to each man a woman to abuse because the proportion is 1:1 . It's not so easy to give to each male a racial slave. So women abuse works very well.

Then the rest of the narrative it's just for filling in, victim gaslighting, extremism labeling to whoever points the reality, intimidation to shut up and keep playing that impossible to win game, etc...",1615967649

Feminism,"&gt;One of the interesting points not illustrated in this graph is that the amount of money an occupation pays is significantly related to the % of men in it.

Well of course it is, it's an average of all jobs, whether male or female dominated. Of course summing this up will show that men make more because there are more fields dominantly men than there is women, and the men in those positions are making more than the women in other fields of work. How is that unfair. 

&gt;It's that work that is thought to be masculine is more inherently valued than work that's thought to be feminine. These issues are certainly related, but it's interesting to see how deeply the pay gap is integrated into the workforce.

Have you done any research into why the gender pay gap exists? There's many more variables than just simply men make more. Ive  worked in the trades with women who make the same as I do, can't produce the same as I do, but still, are paid the same, the same as men who can't necessarily produce the same. There are many female dominated disciplines where women are paid very well, the same as men sometimes more. The pay gap is more complicated than just simply it's not equal, men make more than women. 

Take nursing for example, predominantly female, paid very well, not more or less than men in the field, but based on their time in the field to a cap, then raises with the rise of inflation, the same as their peers. Equally governed trades, which are 99% dominated by men, women are not paid less, they are paid the same, but you have to introduce more variables than just masculine vs feminine valued work to get a more conclusive depiction of why there is a 9% wage gap.

Search any countries occupational breakdown by gender and you'll see the clear divide of which gender fill jobs more than others, and if you understand the major differences between men and women as a whole, you'll know why the gap exists, we are different in two such ways that's makes us choose certain careers. But you also have to take into account simply this.....do women want jobs in these fields that are dominantly men, most cases no. If it was the latter you would be forcing equality of outcome and I don't think anyone wants that in a world where many factors decide who gets a job and the opportunity.

Women who are firefighters when compared to men, make the same amount of money, or have the same opportunity to make the same money. Not all women want to be firefighters, you need to be a certain type of person to work in the field, women aren't built for it the same as men, biologically speaking they don't have the same muscle mass, testosterone, aggressiveness...but does that mean for the women who do work in those fields, do they get paid less, of course not. 

I just fail to see where your argument and frankly anyone else who doesn't see the clear divide of male dominated work that is more masculine being paid more. Well of course, because there are more men working in the field so naturally they will be paid more as a collective driving the average up....

Is it so hard to believe that Childcare workers for example, are predominantly women, 94%, and those women are in that position cause they want to be there, or dental assistants which make up 96.4%. How come more men aren't in that line of work? I'm sure Burly Lumberjack Bill wants to be a childcare worker....no, he doesn't, because he's aggressive by nature, and women dominate those fields because they have more compassion and you don't want aggressive Bill playing around in your mouth.

There are 39900 Carpenters in Ontario, compared to 15000 dental assistants. Should the carpenters get paid more than the dental assistants in terms of job, not by the determination of masculinity or femininity, but danger of the job, working in the elements. Of course they should, and it just so happens that it is a very labor intensive job, would a large percentage of the female population do that job....no, it takes masculine traits, now whether you agree or not the fact is, biologically, it is a masculine job, does that mean that females are inherently undervalued to perform such work? No, they choose not to do to such work.

There is an inherent difference when it comes to equality of outcome and equality of opportunity. Misreading something that isn't fact and projecting it as something else is not understanding or educating yourself properly on the issue.",1616874278

Feminism,"&gt; So I have no affiliation with this site, but I have spent a little time with this data (or at least the version of it a few years ago).
&gt; 
&gt; One of the interesting points not illustrated in this graph is that the amount of money an occupation pays is significantly related to the % of men in it. So, controlling for level of education, the more men in a profession, the more that profession pays. This effect occurs longitudinally as well.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is not just that women are paid less than men. **It's that work that is thought to be masculine is more inherently valued than work that's thought to be feminine**. These issues are certainly related, but it's interesting to see how deeply the pay gap is integrated into the workforce.

80% of professional chefs are men. It's high paying *because* men gravitated to it, imo. And it snowballed from there... for them.     


Computational work and programming work used to be considered ""secretarial"" and under the umbrella of ""women's work"". No it's high paying and dominated by men. Almost to the exclusion of women in the upper echelons.

Anyway now that you managed to evoke these two classic defense tactics, let's crash it : 


&gt;Evidence shows that the porn industry really doesn‚Äôt treat gay men that much better than women.¬†Gay porn actors are dropping dead¬†at an alarming rate and¬†their average age is just 25. Suicide and drug use are major factors in this statistic, as is premature heart failure from steroid use. Gay porn also¬†pays an average yearly salary of $24000, with the expectation that actors supplement their income with prostitution.¬†Men in central europe are being trafficked and raped on camera, and this makes up a significant part of the Czech Republic‚Äôs renowned gay porn industry.¬†At least half of gay porn actors are heterosexual¬†but shoot gay scenes because they make more money than in straight porn ‚Äì this, as much as the actors make light of it, is rape. Former gay porn stars have¬†commented on the prevalence of the PTSD ‚Äúthousand yard stare‚Äù¬†among their coworkers. I once personally met a former gay porn actor who had the thousand yard stare ‚Äì he was also addicted to meth and told me he quit porn after his¬†guts literally started falling out of his ass. Talking of which,¬†bottoms are subjected to slaps, punches and homophobic/misogynistic slurs on camera. If you‚Äôve watched literally any gay porn you‚Äôll have seen this. Why is this violence ok?

&gt;

Homophobic men watch gay porn. Actually gay porn market would have been minimal if not for homophobes. 

&gt;
&gt;

&gt;In order to give vent to male sexual aggression and sadism in homosexual pornography and also to circumvent the cultural stigma that ordinarily attaches to men who are ‚Äútreated like a woman‚Äù in sex, gay male pornography has developed several specific ‚Äúcodes.‚Äù One such code is that a man who is ‚Äúcapable‚Äù of withstanding ‚Äúdiscipline‚Äù ‚Äîextremely punishing bondage, humiliation, and fistfucking, for instance‚Äîis deemed to have achieved a kind of supermasculinity, almost as if the sexual violence his body ingests from another man enhances his own sexual identity as a man. (This is quite the reverse in heterosexual pornography, where sexual sadism against a woman simply confirms her in her subordinate status.) Another code common in gay male pornography, one found frequently in films, is that if a man is shown being assfucked, he will generally be shown assfucking someone else in tum‚Äîthis to avoid the connotation that he is at all feminized by being fucked. Still another code in gay male pornography is that depictions of mutuality are not sustained for very long without an intimation or explicit scene of force or coercion‚Äîso you don‚Äôt go limp out of boredom or anxiety that you‚Äôve been suckered into a scene where there‚Äôs no raw male power present. -- John Stoltenberg,¬†Refusing to be a Man¬†(1989)

&gt;
&gt;

Your ""not all men"" doesn‚Äôt matter. They makes up such a tiny proportion (if they exist) of the consumer base, it‚Äôs like putting a chicken in your back garden and claiming you‚Äôve fixed factory farming. Apologies to those who twist themselves into astonishing shapes to produce the kind of porn consumers they think should exist, but at best all they‚Äôre doing is providing a talking point for people who want to stall the discussion by saying ‚Äúnot all porn‚Äù so they can get back to their vertically integrated faux-incest.",1616942641

Feminism,"*Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism?*

There is a ~ genus-species relation between egalitarianism and feminism.

Feminism is a type of egalitarianism - specifically, one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender. ""Equalism"" or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline, an actual coherent protest movement; we can't actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history/academic texts/produced scholarly works/ideological currency/etc. What you have instead is an umbrella term, an attribute of several schools of thought (a ""trend of thought""), without actually being a school of thought in and of itself. Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal (basically, the most general formulation of social equity) which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought/actual social movements.

Therefore, movements for the rights of various social groups (women, men, children, LGBT, ethnic groups, people with disabilities, etc.) are all components/specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual/activist/concrete terms.

A similar answer can be given for feminism‚Äôs relation with *gender equality*.

Regarding feminism‚Äôs relation with *humanism*: humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective, while feminism has no such precondition (there exist both atheist feminism, and feminist theology).

*Feminism's relation with the men's movement*

The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality. As such, we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence, and the legitimacy, of men‚Äôs issues, and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues.

*Regarding the claim ‚Äúif feminism was an egalitarian movement, there wouldn‚Äôt be a need for a men‚Äôs rights movement‚Äù*

Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements, ideologies and theories. If we are speaking theoretically, then yes, feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men's issues as well. If we are speaking practically, then everyone is free to get involved (or not) in a certain issue, regardless of how strongly they feel about it. Lack of involvement does not mean opposition; by and large, all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis, and it is completely up to them to decide how much time, energy and money they want to invest, and in which issue - without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A, but not on issue B. Most people don't get involved in anything at all, those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement, regardless of their area of action.

[*Dark Theme.*]

""Revenge porn"" as a concept only works because all men know deep down that to be consumed for sexual gratification by a male stranger is inherently degrading. All pornography is ""revenge porn"" to men because all men who watch are getting off on that power over the woman depicted.

---

People say ""revenge porn"" is only bad because the woman doesn't consent. But where are all the other empowering, positive expressions that become so violating and painful when revealed? I've never seen the ex-boyfriend of an artist release ""revenge watercolors"" after a breakup.

---

Plus, I've known more than one man whose girlfriend sold nudes or whatever and after a breakup he STILL immediately shares her ""consensual, empowering"" pornography around because he knows all the men he wants to reach will still see it as degrading. Consent doesn't change that.

2. Women professional soccer teams play at a skill level less than that of under 15s mens (proven many times, just google womens national team vs under 15s mens). So although comparably elite against each other, for the consumer it is equivalent to watching under 15 boys playing, which no one does. 

3. Women‚Äôs sports can sell, but it happens that most of the consumers of sport are men and therefore the women have to appeal to men (maybe there‚Äôs an entire untapped female audience which could shift things?). Examples of elite females selling at the same level of men are Ronda Rousey and Amanda Nunez. Although comparatively rare, they garner the exact same respect as men of the UFC because of how outstanding they are. I think one other reason they are so successful is that their fights are on the same card as the men‚Äôs fights, and so the consumer (mostly male) don‚Äôt have to go searching specifically for their fights, it‚Äôs all under one roof. Maybe women‚Äôs football would do well if it was on the same day/same stadium as the men‚Äôs and with one ticket you could watch both (as is done with ufc).

4. Interesting point but I don‚Äôt have anything to add to it at this stage. I would love to see it happen though. 

5. You can personally change this. You and your friends can buy stadium tickets, shirts, etc etc 
But it won‚Äôt happen because like point 2 the consumers are mostly men. Not 100%, there are women much more interested in sports than some men, but on average a ‚Äúbloke‚Äù is much more into the sports fandom",1616977818

Feminism,"It's just so alien to me. I know a girl who wanted nothing more than to pop out kids and get married the second she graduated school. To me, that is, well.... very limited and to my mind, pathetic.

She's a nice girl and everything, she married a childhood friend of mine and I see them every now and then at gatherings, I'm 32 now and she's about 30. 

They have 2 kids and as far as I am aware she has been nothing more than a stay at home mom all this time since finishing school. No real jobs during that time. Career? what's that? Just spends her time parenting. though unsure what her quality of parenting is seeing as she had a kid when she was still essentially a kid herself (personally I don't think barely adults (essentially still children) should be having children). At that age her brain isn't fully formed, and she didn't have any wisdom or life lessons to impart. 

I'm nice and friendly to her in person and all that, but she's not ""my people"" at all. I disagree with her life decisions and I simply have nothing in common with her. She isn't a deep person or an intellectual so I really have nothing to talk to her about as in my mind she is the epitome of ""limited"".

And show these to those who say women are inferior in terms of physical strength as compared to men. I think hunting is seriously demanding activity from both mental and physical perspective and in those times unimaginably fatal. So, if women could do that at that time of scarcity and ruggedness, I don't think there could be any problem in  employing them in military other than the aversion of stubborn higher ups who are all males(just a blind guess) and their unwillingness to evolve the millitary culture from their self proclaimed ruggedness (which is nothing more than toxicity disguised as Avenue of making you mentally strong)

Hi, just a loving reminder that the U.S. Women's National Team will be at the Olympics.

You know... the reigning World Cup Champs.

## American Pie and But I'm A Cheerleader were both released in 1999.

&gt; **booklandreeve**
&gt;
&gt; American Pie features:
&gt;
&gt; 1. A pact between four straight high school boys to have sex by any means necessary
&gt;
&gt; 2. A male character masturbating into a pie.
&gt;
&gt; 3. A humorous depiction of filming a high school aged girl in a situation without her knowledge or consent, and broadcasting that to the entirety of her peer group and presumably the world. This tragically results in her humiliation and deportation, which means that the male character who filmed her will not be able to have sex with her in time to fulfill the pact (which is why it is tragic). (In a subsequent installment of the American Pie series, the girl returns and is not only not angry, but still amenable to a sexual relationship with said boy.)
&gt;
&gt; But I'm A Cheerleader features:
&gt;
&gt; 1. A satirical depiction of a traumatic and harmful practice known as 'reparative therapy,' colloquially 'degayification', with special attention paid to the fact that it doesn't really work.
&gt;
&gt; 2. One sex scene between female characters, not fully nude,s hot mostly using close ups on the actress' faces. Everyone is consenting, and no one has lied in order to receive consent.
&gt;
&gt; 3. One female character suggested to be masturbating, not shown.
&gt;
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt; The MPAA gave American Pie an R rating, without hassle.
&gt;
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt;
&gt; But I'm A Cheerleader initially received an NC-17 rating. This rating was only lowered to R (thus opening the film up to distribution) when the director agreed to cut a scene featuring the lead female character masturbating. Through her clothes. While thinking about a person, and not a pie.

Feminism,"If we're gonna talk about ""dudes"" is my experience they get comfortable in a relationship and even if they don't want to commit, they want to stay comfortable even if the relationship isn't that good. If she stops feeding him it's going to signal that she's probably going to break up with him. This will worry him and probably cause him to change something in his behavior to win her back, because if he doesn't, his comfortable life is in jeopardy. His ideal life is no change, but getting married is less change than breaking up so he'll probably resign himself to getting married. That is unless he's really really not into her and ready for the relationship to be done, too. Personally I don't think OP should bother with someone who has different goals than her but she definitely shouldn't keep feeding and pampering someone who doesn't care about her goals.",1617106062
