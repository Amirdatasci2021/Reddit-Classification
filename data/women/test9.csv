Feminism,"I'm trying to get rid of dress codes across canada and I've been met with so many responses telling me that dress codes are there to teach being professional and how to chose appropriate dress wear and that the rules are fairly enforced, girls just break them more often, Oh and my favorite ""you want kids running around with thier beasts and asses hanging out?? that's perverted"" 

DRESS CODES ARENT EVERYWHERE FOR A REASON. 

On teaching professionalism, we were allowed to wear pajamas and literally anything else because of ""freedom of expression"" but no boobs or thighs. Completely contradicts the point. 

On teaching appropriate dress attire, Aparently we dont need to teach this in elementary schools when we learn about the weather or universities where we actually have an idea of what kind of professional we want to be and were practicing getting there. because they have no dress code. So only in high schools. 

The problem is that I didnt find myself sexy or even think about boys liking one of my body parts more than another. Then I went to school one day and I was sent home because I was violating the dresscode, I showed that it wasnt true, My principal was wrong. I had no one to go to, to protect me from him saying that its distracting and they want to protect me. I missed math that day because I was sent home. I cried all day and I seriously think that shit was traumatizing. not to mention the comments girls got when they were violating the dress code and got called to the office. I remember a girl in class said that's what they get for being sluts every time they got called.  I think the lasting effects that it has on womens self esteem and ideas about the way the world should work isnt worth it. I think alot of other countries have accepted that they dont like those results and dont have dresscodes. I'm so frustrated that it's so hard to convince anyone or get attention on this issue. I need your guyses stories!! I need this to blow up. I want to change the world help me do it.",1611856535

Feminism,"Hi all, hoping for some advice. I’m middle management and want to do a 12 week online course on the principles of feminist leadership - think it would be great for me and my career, but also my work (surely?!) 

I’d like work to pay for it (there is an individual rate but would like it to be the one bit of CPD they fund for me this year). The cost won’t be the problem (£600)... it’s the continent - they might get scared! It’ll be unfamiliar to them. They’d much prefer me to do a straight management course or similar. 

Any advice on how I can approach it? Anyone with similar experiences?

Feminism,"So my boyfriend is (usually) very supportive. He is also definitely not misogynistic, he is respectful of women and feminist on most issues. We often have this conflict about what he calls his ‘humor’ though. He would make this very hyperbolic remark, something that doesn’t fit his true views at all. Like he would comment on a bad driver being a woman, or be like “probably because she’s a woman” for failures by women. I truly believe he doesn’t believe this, but he says he says these things to ‘trigger me’, since I am indeed a feminist and very annoyed by these remarks. He thinks this annoyance is funny. However sometimes I do more than rolling my eyes and actually start ranting about what he says not being okay. Then we usually fight. 

I personally think it’s not okay. Both what he says and wanting to see me ‘triggered’ for his amusement. I also generally hate the ‘it’s just a joke, don’t overreact’ attitude. 

I’m just looking for thoughts because he is still defending it as ‘his sense of humor’ and he might have a point too. He always assures me he’s feminist and he is also making fun of people saying these things unironically. What do you think? And if you think it’s not okay do you have any rational arguments for me to use to explain him this can’t just pass as ‘humor’?",1611778071

Feminism,Hi everyone I'm a young male and wondering what I can do to help women and be a feminist?,1611766369
Feminism,"The reason I ask this is because it has personally effected me. When I was younger (middle school to be exact) I went to family court with my parents to see who got custody of my siblings and I. I wanted to live with my mom because we had a much better connection than my dad and I had. (also my dad did some shitty things so obviously I didn’t want to live with him) However, my dad won custody over my siblings and I, so I had to live with him for 3 years. This took a toll on me as he had moved 1 hour away from where I grew up. So I lost a lot of good friends, and my dad had put my brother and I in the worst middle school ever... So that was unpleasant. I would’ve turned out a lot better if I lived with my mom. 

So now I hate the family court, they made me go through hell for 3 years and I will never forgive that judge. But, maybe I’m just too biased for this argument, since my dad isn’t the greatest. So what are the facts with this argument? What makes men oppressed in the family court system, because if anything I felt my mom was being very mistreated that day in court.",1611766018

Feminism,"So, I've stopped removing my body hair in large quantities (like clean shaving anywhere) because I've found the more I do it, the more uncomfortable I get. 2 days after shaving/waxing I'd grow ingrown hairs and get rashes everywhere regardless of the style of body hair removal, so I stopped shaving my legs and now I only trim my pubic hair for comfort (and easy deodorant application

I stopped for a few reasons, it was uncomfortable, it was something I felt I had to do 2-3 times a week to maintain the 'smooth' look but I asked myself why I did it and did some researching and found out that majority of the ideas of body hair being 'uncleanly' or 'ugly' only applies when it's on women and is deep rooted in social standards and practices such as fashion, modelling and (surprise, surprise) misogyny! 

After finding out why I was doing it I slowly felt more comfortable going out unshaven but mostly because I never wore short skirts or strapless shirt outside. With lockdown it's made me more comfortable but I want to be able to go outside and not fear what others will think or, God forbid, comment on my underarm hair or leg hair. Part of me is scared and the other part of me is confident but I can't help but feel uneasy when I want to wear a skirt outside or wear short sleeves. 

(For context, I live in a fairly toxic part of a major city (strong misogynistic views and too much violence) and I'm a female person of colour (part of me is scared that people would comment on my body hair and relate it to my Black heritage and the not so lovely racism perception of me being a 'monkey'))

Feminism,"I like watching rom-coms and teen movies because I generally watch movies to relax at the end of the week, whereas I read when I want to be challenged. However, most of these kinds of films are painfully sexist, among many other '-ist's. I really just want to watch films that have a light-hearted tone and are about the way people connect with each other, romantically or otherwise, and those two genres seem the closest thing I can find to doing that. I'm sick of movies that are depressing or violent.

As a queer woman who practices relationship anarchy, I don't expect to find movies that reflect my values exactly, but I was just hoping for something better than the bullshit I find on 'top 10 rom-coms' listicles. I also would like to watch more indie and international films (I'm Australian) as I don't vibe with most mainstream American humour, but I don't know how it is that people hear about those kinds of movies. If someone has a recommendation for an American movie that fits the bill, though, please share anyway, even if it's well-known!

My own recommendations for things that others in my position might like include Ladybird, Edge of Seventeen, Maggie's Plan, Juno, Little Miss Sunshine, An Education, and any of the films by the director Hirokazu Koreeda (my favourite movie is his Shoplifters, though it's not as lighthearted as the other films on this list. Like Father Like Son is a good one to start with).  The 1931 version of Madchen in Uniform is good too, and queer, though it gets dark towards the end. I also love You've Got Mail, and I enjoy older British rom-coms like Four Weddings and a Funeral, and Notting Hill. The quasi-polyamorous set-up in part of Bridget Jones' Baby was something I enjoyed as well. My Australian recommendation is Top-End Wedding, which is lots of fun and is one of few rom-coms I know that isn't from a completely white perspective.

I'm sure there are others who feel similarly to me, so all recommendations would be super appreciated!",1612143187

Feminism,"I was reading a discussion recently posted about what cis men thought about taking their wife’s last name, and all were appalled by the mere suggestion of it. When reading through the comments there were many who said that neither partner changed their last name when getting married. Both kept their last names as a mutual decision. But my question applies to those that did get married and never changed their last names and had children, but gave their children their husband’s last name and not the wife’s. And I’m just curious as to why that decision was made? I’m not coming from a place of malice, I’m just very curious about this subject. As it happens a lot in hetero couples that aren’t married and have children together, that the child will nearly always have the father’s last name. When I tried to find out why, I couldn’t really get a clear answer and wanted to ask feminists what they thought on the subject. 

I’d love to be enlightened as to why this happens, other than the patriarchy, because let’s be honest the women are doing all the hard work to create a children and they don’t even get her last name? I just think that’s bonkers.",1612139504

I think the fetishization of lesbian and bi women is a very big issue. I really wish more feminists would talk about it. It comes from deep-rooted misogyny and makes men feel as though they have authority over women's relationships. I'm really happy Tee Noir talked about this. There's also an issue with the fetishization of gay and bi men (mostly in yaoi), but it's a bit different, and that discussion doesn't belong here.",1612124762

Feminism,"I have encountered this same problem three times in my life already and I’m only 17. Friends of mine have been sexually assaulted in one way or another by our other friends. The girl has always said that it’s all okay and we should all keep being friends but I think that they just don’t wanna make a big deal about it. I believe everyone deserves a second chance but only if they actually show remorse and improvement and usually they can get a second chance with new friends, but not with the same friends they assulted.. And I think that forgiveness is only healthy if it’s genuine.  Do I believe the girls who say it’s completely okay and stay friends with the guys? The girls are still friends with the guys btw. Is there any way that this situation is okay or is it always fucked to give a guy the benefit of the doubt and believe they can change. Feeling very conflicted because I view rapists as absolutely awful people but I know these guys and they are so nice. Life is so messed up. 
What do I do? Why do men have to be such crap bags and mess everything up.",1612291085

Feminism,"So i was sitting down at my vanity today and realized  i haven't done my makeup in 2 weeks. That is quite unusual, as i usually love my crazy colours that i put on everyday, but since i'm working from home i just sleep in as long as i can most days instead of getting up at 6am.
And i had a realization: i'm actually not doing this for me, but not for the men in my life either. It's mostly women who even see that i match my eyemakeup to my patterned masks everyday, or its a conversation starter with other artistically inclined people. 

I've gotten a lot of shit in the past by other men in my life who thought it was ""too much"" and i always told them i do it for myself, which is not as true as i thought it was. 

Idk, pointless ramble, but i just thought i wanted to share this. Do you guys still do your makeup at home alone?",1612287417

Feminism,"Whenever a woman posts something sexual, men in the comment section will post mock comments like “wE ARenT ObjeCTs” or say “oh you say you don’t want us to objectify you but you do shit like this”.
I know being sexy doesn’t turn you into an object.
The problem is I don’t have a fully formulated argument to say this, can anyone explain to me why do men think being sexy makes you an object? Like:
- What’s the logic behind it? Why do they think it makes sense?
- Why does it happen?
- Where does it come from?
- How can I refute it in an argument?",1612285451

Magistrate Habte Worku is a Magistrate of the courts in Toronto Ontario.

Shortly before his appointment he was fired from his job with the Ontario Government's Insurance commission as a government mediator after an investigation revealed he sexually assaulted an insurance agent and made sexually inappropriate remarks to a coworker.  This was taken to arbitration where he was found to have committed the sex assault, the case documents can be found at this link from the Canadian Legal Information Institute:

The government was aware of this when they appointed him to the court, and they even reference his time as a government mediator as his qualification for the job.  You can find the link here

A bunch of men CAME AFTER ME like genuinely pissed off! I have never seen men get SO mad about feminism. I definitely knew I surround myself with liberal minded men but didn't realize how hateful men actually are! They were so mad, they came after me calling me ugly, making fun of the idea of self love saying it's for ugly women, they said the OP should make herself hotter if she wants attention, told me my advice to her was shit. 

I was appalled. I guess I'm sheltered in a feminist bubble. I didn't realize how angry men still are. I thought tsis was 202, all it did was make me realize feminism is still very much behind and there is ALOT of work to do.

Indian society hates women. It hates unmarried good-looking women even more. There is a reason why women like Draupadi, Sita and Shakuntala exist in our literature. They are warnings meant to educate you. If you're in the wrong place, you will be punished, and everyone will love to watch you burn. Misogyny is a part and parcel of Indian culture. It has always been this way and it will always be this way.
Your biggest asset is your financial independence. This is the ONLY leverage you have and will ever have. Do NOT sacrifice your education or career for your family or children. Invest in yourself, invest in your future. Keep your finances separate from your partner. Do not trust anyone with your money. If your husband/boyfriend spends money on you, try to match it as much as you can. Do NOT accept free lunches.
If your partner is paying for the house you live in, it is not your house. What belongs to you is only what belongs to you legally. Unless you pay the rent (and keep the receipts) or have the lease in your name, it is not your house. It doesn’t matter if you have lived in it for 6 months or 10 years. It is not your house.
The Indian state is an extension of the Indian family. Deeply patriarchal and broken. Don’t rely on the police, media, or any kind of state apparatus. You need to know that you’re vulnerable. Only money and power can protect you. Acquire those.
Indian society doesn’t believe in love. It believes in transactions. Indians pay billions of rupees to watch romance on-screen but for them, it exists only on screen. It is entertainment. Be careful with who you love. Do not devote yourself to men who don't deserve it. Shower your love on yourself before you give it to any man.
What is considered fun for men, is considered debauchery for women. Indian society doesn't see women as humans who need to relax and enjoy themselves. If he smokes weed, he is stressed and needs to let loose. If you drink alcohol, you are a characterless bad influence. Remember this hypocrisy and have fun with only those who you trust. If you can afford it, travel outside India to have fun.
Learn to think of relationships in terms of sunk costs. This is a concept in finance but it applies to life too. You don't need to stay in a bad investment just because you invested in it. Just because you gave a man 5 years in your past, you don't need to give him 5 years of your future. You can walk away anytime. Limit your losses. The past is irrelevant to the future.
If you have to live with dignity on your own terms, you have to fight. You have to fight everyone and everything. You will be crushed often. But it is a price worth paying.




If I can make an appeal- PLEASE educate yourself about patriarchy. It is a system so deep-rooted and insidious that it is often hard to recognize. Familiarize yourself with the works of Indian feminists such as Kamla Bhasin. You can start with her TED talk here. Before I met her, I thought people were bigoted and they have to be ignored/challenged etc.

Thank you again!

Feminism,"As a woman, I feel whenever a man gets frustrated or feels threatened, they always insult the appearance/body. I’ve noticed this with my friends at college as well. It makes me notice more how when men want to hurt women they attack what they have deemed our greatest asset/value (our bodies). As if telling women they look unattractive will lower their value as a human. In general, insulting other people isn’t good, but it feels especially demeaning and dehumanizing when a woman is arguing with a man and the man dismisses her argument by saying, “well she’s unattractive...”. It feels common for men to devalue women’s opinions by attaching our worth to our bodies, because they believe if we aren’t desirable to them, our words have no worth. 

Let me know if anyone has experienced this/relates to this, it’s just something I was thinking about.",1612426038

Abstract: ""In successfully recruiting a portion of its membership from various online communities of white men who feel threatened and rejected by women, the Alt-Right movement promotes a sense of male entitlement that is easily radicalized and connected to white nationalism and white supremacy. While the Alt-Right proclaims to be able to offer something of value to the men who join them, the movement has never been about helping men cope with low self-esteem, relationship problems, or their personal pain and insecurity. How, then, do we explain its ability to appeal to a certain group of white men? 

Trolling feminism and progressive or liberal thought, the Alt-Right has created a culture of vitriolic defensiveness among young white males, which aims to establish a common belief in white male victimhood. In order to understand its rise, we therefore have to examine how the movement in part came into existence as a rejection of the accomplishments of feminism. By constructing a complex cultural narrative of male vulnerability the Alt-Right has created a uniting collective of men who view the subordination of women as both part of a functional society and a stepping stone to a larger movement: one steeped in fascist ideology and willing to openly champion a politics of hate and violence.""",1612398878

**The battle between Liz Cheney and Majorie Greene is two sides of the same coin.** 

This is the complexity of two Patriarchal women who are debating how to ""be better"" at maintaining the patriarchal system: the old way of subtlety or the new way of conspiracy -- both equally dangerous. And let's face it: Cheney's 'conservatism' helped birth Greene's fringe. While many might want to praise Cheney for standing up to Greene - we need to realize the 'cancer' was in the GOP (now GQP) long before Greene ever showed up on the scene. This isn't a phenomenon, this is \*the\* evolution of what has occurred for a long time. 

**Women**: we need to step into our empowerment and push back on both of these women. They are powerful yes, but they are not empowered w/ themselves and it's up to us to show up and be willing to change the narrative.

I have written before, White Women are the most potent weapon for the Patriarchal system. Because if the system can keep White women deceived into thinking they should not have full autonomy over their own body, mind, place, or that they need permission on any subtle level, then Patriarchy wins. White Women have a history of enabling the abuse of Patriarchy. 

Let's recognize this and do an about face. Our militancy should be in alignment with the [**Abolition Feminist Movement**](https://vimeo.com/250105924), begun by our Black, Brown and Indigenous Sisters.

Right now, the Woman in Congress standing up for and with women is AOC. Some of you may be very confused by that if you're been a conservative most of your life, but she has been bold enough to share her truth and the truth of [**1 in 5 Women in the United States**](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence) (and that's just what's reported and that we know of).

The point I'm making is we, within ourselves, need to take on this fight - for the sake of Healing and Justice in our country. Remember, **Amanda** [**Gorman**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNFAICB8vxw) said what ""just is"" isn't always ""jus-tice"" - let's change that, shall we?

I was never really told how hard pregnancy was. It’s often glamorized on social media , movies, etc. It’s a beautiful thing to grow and birth a baby but it’s not glamorous. I was set up with unrealistic expectations. At the beginning I was so sick I could hardly function. I remember trying to be strong , force myself to get up every morning , go work 40 hours a week fearing people wouldn’t take my sickness seriously or would see me as weak. I remember even the father of my unborn baby would grow tired of me being sick or see me as a burden. I lost weight every where and wasn’t able to keep down food for about 4 months. On top of that,  the anxiety of everything you do effects your baby, the hormone shifts, loneliness, and the worry. I began to suffer from panic attacks and uncontrollable sobbing. I was worried that I couldn’t keep enough food down to allow my baby to get enough nutrients, I was worried he could have the same potentially fatal birth defect I did, I was worried about getting Covid, finances during a pandemic , and so on. As my pregnancy continued I eventually got over being so sick however, random vomiting &amp; nausea never ended. The physical pain of growing bigger ..sore breasts, round ligament pain, cramps, and contractions. The fatigue also never ended. You never stop feeling drained. I also struggled with finding clothes to wear. I always loved fashion and took pride in what I would wear. During pregnancy that goes out the window. I struggled to find pants because I’m tall and skinny. Trying to find bras is a nightmare , no one makes a size 32E that is reasonably priced. My wardrobe consisted on leggings , sweats, and baggy shirts. “Dressing up” could no longer be a reality . Eventually that takes a toll on your confidence. It’s hard to feel beautiful while in pain , getting bigger, and not being able to wear anything you want. 
There’s so much pressure on women to have a “beautiful” pregnancy and to never complain. But in reality it takes a toll on you physically, mentally, and emotionally. Men call you crazy for being emotional, friends think you are dramatic when you say you don’t feel up to leaving the house, etc. it needs to be normalized that pregnancy is not glamorous. It’s hard work and draining. You sacrifice everything about yourself to grow your baby. Yes it is worth it, and the unconditional love between you &amp; baby is worth every second. But it’s important that pregnancy being miserable , painful , and hard is NORMALIZED.",1612337409

As a crypto-enthusiast and an avid Feminist and passionate freedom fighter of the patriarchy and the oppressors I firmly believe that we must do whatever it takes to empower women wherever we can and to help bring awareness to the struggle of the female and their plights. Crypto-technology is one of the key players in the battle for freedom amongst the people against the totalitarian government and also one of the most heavily male-dominated places possible, seeing how it's the future of finance I don't want it to end up like the old governance systems that are heavily male-dominated and controlled by the patriarchy. So I've decided to launch a project to show these Crypto boys that girls can spice up the crypto space to xD.    


**Introducing Trash Panda**  I've created a token whose sole use is to help represent and fuel protocols on the Ethereum Blockchain designed to help female empowerment-related products and to bring female representation to the Blockchain. I called it Trash Panda because they're resilient, strong, and creative like the female spirit also I think they're cute rawr :3. However, I do not want this to be a female ONLY token alone as I am a bleeding heart activist I also want this token to be inclusive to people of all genders, races, religions, etc even CIS-WHITE MALES who want to check their privilege by participating in this token. I want this token to be at the forefront of progressiveness into the Blockchain-sphere and introduce LGBTQ + and Feminism-themed governance and concepts into the world of Crypto-Technology it'd be really cool if you guys check it out\~!

Feminism,"I’m sorry if this isn’t the sub to ask this question. 

I have a, rather sexist, classmate in my romanticism course. I’ve provided him with some sources, papers from 1970 etc which show how male critics have mistaken female voices in literature for ‘hysterical’ when compared to male voices despite their writing and perspective being presented the same i.e. the subject of a text being female and displaying emotion being hysterical and the male subjects being considered intelligent or rational despite displaying the same emotional response. 

Does anyone have any sources for this, or any ways to explain how this is the case better than I can?",1612475092

Feminism,"r/Feminism is looking for new mods!

**Hello everyone!**

We are looking to add some new moderators to our moderation team, and are accepting applications now. The positions would start as junior mods before moving into full moderation duties.

The junior mod position would include helping remove comments and posts that are off topic, with other moderation duties to follow.

**What we are looking for in a junior moderator:**

*Investment in feminism!* - We don’t require you to have an academic background in women's issues, although that is welcome. We do require you identify as a feminist, and all ages (over 18), nationalities and genders are welcome. If you are part of a vulnerable community please note this as well, as increasing the diversity of our team is a priority.

*Constructive attitude* - No history of hate speech including transphobia, ableism, ageism, sexism etc

*Ability to work individually and with a team* -  our moderation team functions in English. While fluency in other languages is very welcome a junior mod should be able communicate constructively with an English speaking team.


**If you are interested (and we do welcome all applications!) please [send a message to the moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/Feminism) that includes:**

*Account age, preferred pronouns*. We won’t be able to accept new accounts or those with little to no post history.

*Timezone and expected availability* 

*A brief background on your feminism.* This can include issues that are important to you, previous activism, or why you are interested in joining the team. 

Feel free to add anything you might feel is relevant and could add to your application or help us get to know you.

Thank you everyone for being such a wonderful and engaged community, and we look forward to seeing your thoughts.

Cheers!",1613056282

Feminism,"So for the past few months I have noticed a lot of men talking about the fact that they're puzzled at best and scared at worst when approaching women nowadays. At first I thought, that's not what the MeToo movement and women speaking up was about, surely they must feel guilty about something to say this. And then it hit me : it is precisely because a majority of men didn't know how ubiquitous and commonplace harassment is, and that they started realising that themselves or their close ones have had misogynistic thoughts and or actions in the past, and how deep all of these behaviours go, that that discovery was so shocking and upsetting to them. Now the problem is, some of them are directly blaming women for speaking up because they weren't aware of this before, in a classic case of shooting the messenger. But if we think of fear and anger as signals that something is wrong, and that we have to take these feelings into consideration and do something about the situation, then perhaps it's a good thing that they feel that way, because it shows that they too find it appalling. And disheartening, when they find that they have participated in this in one way or another.

I was brought to these thoughts while reading the book ""Sorcières"", or ""Witches"", by Swiss journalist and essayist Mona Chollet (pretty sure most European francophones on this sub know about her). It's a very interesting read, and at the end of her book she talks about how mind and body were separated by (male) thinkers of the 16th century, mostly opposing ""male rationality"" and ""female emotion"". She said that since our way of thinking has not changed much since then, we still see emotion as ""irrational"" and to be avoided at all costs, and what we think of as an ""objective, detached"" fact as the logical and preferred tool to approach our world. But the thing is, when we witness something horrifying and upsetting, it is actually much more logical to be scared and angry than always trying to ""take a step back"", because some things are too serious and dangerous to only be taken as a ""subject of interest"" to be studied at arm's length.

Feminism,"Good Morning,
Just needed to get a few things off my chest, and I think this would probably be the best place to do it.
Anyway, I was a big fan of metal/rock music, until about a week ago. Then I found out what many bands did on tour. It turns out that it is ""standard operating proceedure"" for many bands to use the roadies to ask young people (often 18 year girls and the like) backstage for sex, generally under the guise of an aftershow party or just meeting the band.

I consider myself sex positive, but my problem with this is that, even if it's technically consensual, it puts a fan in a position where they could easily be pressured into things they could not have wanted to do. It shows someone's character, and that they do not respect or have empathy for the fan's position, be they male or female. I think it's very likely a number of people agreed to sex in these conditions because they felt pressured to by the situation engineered by the band/entourage, which is not exactly consensual, and the professionals in question were either willfully ignorant or straight up taking advantage of that power.

I still consider it morally reprehensible even if it was consensual-using your position as a musician and your ontourage to sleep with generally
young, impressionable people who look up to you. 
 There are parallels to be drawn behind such bands who use that power and the powerful men who were brought to justice via the metoo movement.

I've been in two minds about this-I wanted to defend my favs of course, and did for few days in my mind.  But I myself work in social care, and if I saw this happening in front of my eyes, I would be disturbed, and I can no longer defend it.

I was also shocked when I saw people posting about it online, defending it. Like, if, say, a fashion editor was picking out girls in the audience at a modeling show and getting an assistant to ask them backstage for sex, I doubt those same people would agree with it.

Makes me wonder about parasocial relationships and the double standards we are all to quick to give people. Look at David Bowie-back in the 70s, he raped a 13 year old girl (Lori Mattox). She said she consented. But morally and legally speaking, no 13 year old can consent. Even back in the 70s this was considered reprehensible. Yet he is not remembered as a child rapist, in the way that the reputation of other famous dead artists (you know who I am talking about) are, or Ian Watkins is.

I've been shaken to the core by this. Sounds silly, but even though I knew about Weinstein types, it never really sunk in until I discovered artists I knew were doing this. 

I suffer from OCD, which makes it worse, as my mind tries to justify obessesive, disturbing thoughts to make myself feel better.
Anyway, thank you for listening to my rant. I just wanted to put this out there so others could know-I want to do a bit of good in the world. To provide a warning to young girls at concerts.

EDIT: Here's a link to an article talking about the experience of female roadies, and how they are trying to tackle misconduct in the industry against  fans and staff. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/06/youre-left-to-rot-if-you-speak-up-the-abuse-faced-by-female-roadies",1614078994

Feminism,"When a man mentions going to the strip club I find it very off putting. 

I think it’s because they are reinforcing the fact that straight men don’t ever see women as actual humans but as beings to serve them in some regard. I see them as the men who objectify women the most. 

However, I am happy women have monetised from this and view SW in a positive light.  

So is it a backwards view I have on the men who go there yet respect the workers? 

Looking for your perspectives/opinions and more. 

Looking to broaden my thought pattern. 

Thanks!",1614059272

Feminism,"Over the last few years, I’ve noticed that my YouTube recommended videos have began to become more anti-feminist and sexist in nature. Like, I tend to watch a lot of movie reviews and commentary videos, and I began to see videos talking about how Brie Larson is evil and wants to destroy all men, or other movies with strong female leads getting completely railed for wanting to have diversity. And it’s just been so exhausting. Even when I try to find feminist videos that are positive and informative, especially ones that aren’t in the mainstream like Contrapoints, Hbomberguy, John Oliver, or Philosophy Tube, it’s just a bunch of response videos that perform bad faith arguments against feminism. What’s worst is that they’re popular and can get easily clicks without saying much in particular. I’m not saying people can’t critique certain aspects of feminism, like how being a terf can hurt transgender women and men, but every video I see that try to argue against feminism, it ends up being someone taking a few rare examples and generalizing the entire movement. Or, if a creator wants to talk about how men face sexism too, they’ll end up blaming it on feminism rather than the gender roles that are placed on men, women, and non-binary by traditional values. Then, there are some videos where they’ll agree that gender roles are a problem, but will discredit feminism by saying that instead of saying women’s right, we need to just say rights, or humanism rather than feminism.

It’s honestly just sad that now saying you’re a feminist is a contested issue. Rather than being seen as a positive, it’s now being seen as a negative thing built on the back of straw man’s, bad faith arguments, and misinformation.",1614057733

Feminism,"Specifically dentists. When I was younger, I got sexually assaulted (possibly raped) by our family dentist. The guy has always creeped me out, and I always felt uneasy around him but my dad used to be good friends and golf buddies with him (my dad is also a creep and we have no relationship now but that is a different story). I remember loathing going to the dentist when I had braces on and had to visit every two weeks. This anxiety extended to visits to the doctor/hospital, OBGYN, etc. 

I only told 2 people this (other relatives) and they did not seem to care. And that has led to my mental decline and depression including bulimia. Long story short, decades later I had to move countries away, start anew. And I am getting my health back. 

But I’m still scared shitless of dentists. I haven’t been to a dentist in years, I have poor teeth, I haven’t smiled in years. It’s not noticeable if I don’t laugh, but it’s really bad. I don’t know what to do.

Feminism,"Hi, all. I’m not sure how to begin this post?

*Please keep this discussion respectful and civil*

I’m not exactly sure what to say because I’ve never actually contemplated this question before until very recently, so please me if I don’t articulate my thoughts clearly. This thread was created with the intention to welcome anyone to discuss this topic (respectfully and civilly), for me to explore my own stance on this matter (as I’ve never challenged it before), and to hopefully get a bit more education from all opinions regarding this topic.

*If you decide to state facts to support your opinions, please provide links to sources that can back you up, thanks!*

Below are some of my thoughts already going into this. I’m not sure if they’ll be beneficial or worthwhile for this discussion but decided to add them in case they were!

I’ve always morally supported sex workers. I’ve been watching porn since I was young. I do believe there is a lot of exploitation and abuse in the porn and sex work industry. I also believe there are safe ways for sex workers to make a living or hold a job in that field (even if it may still be considerably riskier than a “normal” job). I have loved getting to know myself through watching porn; I have found some empowerment through exploring myself via porn. I also believe I’ve harmed myself in conscious and unconscious ways by consistently viewing porn. I believe porn can be both helpful and harmful for society and individuals. I am very liberal leaning. I am a feminist.

Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of posts on various social media that encourage the support of sex workers, education of their industry, and protecting people in that field. I’ve also been seeing posts that condemn the consumption of porn. Seeing the mix of these types of posts in my feeds confused me. The majority, if not all, people I follow online have the same views as I do politically and socially, and all my friends morally support people in adult entertainment and also watch porn. So, I guess I was confused to see the condemnation of porn from what I thought were like-minded individuals (and I’ve never met someone who supported sex workers but disagreed with porn). It got me thinking about what is right and wrong and what I believe.

So, feel free to leave your own thoughts below on the matter. Below are a couple questions I’ve been wondering to myself and would love to see other people answer.

*TL;DR Is watching porn morally bad, even if you’re watching someone(s) who is producing content in a safe and healthy way?*

Can you support sex workers/the adult entertainment industry if you condemn porn? If so, how?

*Reminder to keep discussion as respectful and civil as possible. If you mention facts in your discussion, please try to add a link to your sources*",1614303079

Feminism,"I'm just wondering how other feminists view male violence, and possible causes to that. I've noticed recently that when talking about this topic many women believe it's because of an inherent drive to dominate and have power over others in a way that women don't. A woman close to me said that men  biologically want to make others feel bad to feel better about themselves. Where I live these sorts of beliefs are somewhat normal, and although I agree to a certain degree I feel like it's a bit harsh and derogatory to say stuff like that. So, I wonder, what do you view as possible causes to the overwhelming amount of male violence over female? Do you think it's purely biological, induced by society or both?",1614280902

Feminism,"Full disclosure: I’m working on an art project for women’s history month. It’s going to focus on deconstructing quotes and sayings that are damaging to women but are meant to be empowering.

I’ve gathered up an entire Pinterest board about modesty, purity, and the toxic idea of there only being one kind of “strong woman,” and that only the women that “power through” are the only successful ones. Just from searching “empowering women.” 

I would love your input, and an explanation for why it’s damaging if you want to include it. I don’t plan to use many words, so I won’t be taking your words and using them as mine.

Thank you!",1614278281
Feminism,"So I know engaging with TERFs isn't exactly helpful but a point I see them bring up is that trans women are a ""hideous parody of womanhood"". Usually by engaging in an ""overperformance of femininity"" and while I know I won't be able to convince any died in the wool bigots, maybe an average person will see this and it'll help them understand.

See when you're trans you don't exist in a world where it is considered ""positive"" for you to behave in a hyper feminine manner. Because by and large being raised in a boys world allows significantly less room for gender variance than growing up as a woman. In a lot of way it's one of the great failings of second wave feminism. As the ability for men to express themselves in non-traditionally masculine ways is not incredibly different from that of the 1950s. People assigned male at birth are still beaten to death for wearing dresses and make-up. That generally speaking does not happen for women wearing pants.

As a result your acceptance into broader society as a trans woman is directly tied to your ability to be authentically seen as a woman by your peers. And if you don't ""pass"" well enough to be seen as such, you better put in the extra effort. The punishment for failing to meet these expectations can be extreme. Being socially ostracized and feeling unsafe are just the beginning. Losing your job, losing access to medal care (not just transition related), and violence both physical and sexual are all distinct possibilities. So you perform femininity like your life depends on it because it does. So the next time you see a ""hideous parody of womanhood"". Just know that the scorn you may feel is why she is the way she is.",1614276684

Feminism,I think it is funny that this Cohen guy comments on how Guliani is a disgusting person but yet he never mentions sexist.  He does call him a pervert but that is not the same thing.  The fact that Rudy Guliani is objectifying Michelle Wei is degrading and this type of behavior is exactly why women are not taken seriously in politics.  Just look at the percentage of women in the White House.  Cohen should have mentioned sexism.  What do you think?  Is being a pervert the same as being sexist?  Why do you think Cohen never even mentioned sexism?  Is it out of ignorance or do you think he is only addressing a male audience?,1614465702

I’m accepting that you cant educate everyone and that I’m still doing my part especially with women’s issues. 

As well as this I also made a comment on a post around why women use softeners in speech due to sexism replying to someone who didnt think it was a gendered issue and trying to explain my perspective that both genders do it but for different reasons and talking about my fears with having to soften my speech due to fear when being sexually harassed that if I’m too intense they get aggressive.

I was pleased to see someone respond to it positively saying they agreed....the only part they agreed with was that I mentioned men struggle too...and continued to talk about why men have it harder... This is why I really debate trying to educate people though I still try to.",1614387329

Feminism,"Hello there

I noticed a trend at work where people have started referring to women as females. 
""We should help females by starting a community""
""Females should have the same salaries as men""
Etc.

I cannot explain how much this grates on my brain. First off not all women are genetically female. So you exclude trans women. 
Secondly, female is more of a sciencey term, used to describe animals? 
I am now wondering if I am just exaggerating or if my views are simply wrong? 

Looking to see what people think.


Later edit: a trans woman mentioned below that I am wrong about females excluding trans women. Since she is the expert in the matter, I will remove that part from my argumentation. I always thought that female speaks to reproduction systems essentially. Hope I didn't offend anyone, learned something new :)",1614846016

Recently I’ve noticed that my boyfriend of just over a month holds opinions that I disagree with. I respect people’s opinions however they were opinions on women, lgbtq+, racism etc, real people’s lives basically. This is kind of where I draw the line since I speak from experience when talking about feminism and lgbtq+ especially and I also have a diverse group of friends. So when someone expresses a negative opinion on women for example it gets very personal to me. When we discuss these issues he says he normally disagrees with me and when I suggest he educates himself first then he says “that’s boring” or “it’s not important”. I try my best to educate him but I can only do so much, he has to be willing to learn. It’s putting a strain on our relationship. I don’t want to just give up on him because this stuff is so important. If i give up on him then he will just continue holding these negative views and opinions.",1614815661

Feminism,"Does anyone else feel the same way as me?

Let me explain where I am coming from:

(TW: I do bring up Rape, Abuse, Virginity, and Purity Culture)

This is a topic that relates pretty strictly to heterosexual/cisgender couples, so please bear with me.

Something that has bothered me for some time is the stereotype of fathers threatening their daughter's boyfriends before dates. It is often portrayed in movies and television, and it is something that I think is still very pervasive in U.S. society (as well as other societies of course), particularly in conservative and/or religious homes.

I recently had a discussion with my (mostly) feminist mom and she just could not see where I was coming from.

Here is my argument: this ""protecting"" of daughters by fathers is super problematic on many levels, but the main one is that I think it takes away from the identity of the daughter as her own person. She is only someone because of her father and what his protection awards her. It is in the same vein as when a woman is attacked for speaking out about rape or sexual harassment, and people will say ""what if she was your mother/daughter/sister?"" It effectively takes away that woman's identity and awards it to the men around her (father, brother, etc.) Each woman is her own person, and she should not only be given an identity when it relates to a man in her life.

Edit: I wanted to add one more point - that I believe that the fathers protecting daughters is problematic in that it creates this toxic cycle of men only respecting men: boyfriends respect their girlfriends only when they have a father (or brother) behind them. What happens to the girls who don't have fathers/brothers? Should they be treated differently because a man isn't threatening to beat up their boyfriends?

The second reason I find it problematic is because no father (or mother) ever says to a girl to be kind to their son, that they better not ""hurt"" their son. Lots of men have experienced heartbreak from a girl they have dated, but this is a non-issue. To me this is mostly due to purity culture, because essentially what father's are really saying when they say ""you better not hurt my daughter or else..."" is you better not have sex with her, because virginity is still seen as a virtue and without it a woman is effectively devalued.

When I spoke with my mom about this she said that fathers doing this is a way of loving and protecting women, that because we are the ""fairer"" sex we will always be weaker than men, and that is what fathers are worried about. But I would argue it is not the safety of their daughters, it is, once again, the virginity that they are worried about. No father says don't you even think about killing my daughter, hitting my daughter, raping my daughter, etc. I would argue that those horrific things are not even implied - it is solely about virginity, and that is why no one cares about their sons being ""hurt"" because virginity and purity are solely in the hands and responsibility of women.

I would love the input of others, and I thought this sub would be a good place to start. Does anyone else agree with me or see where I am coming from? Or am I way off base?",1614926019
Feminism,"So as you probably read I'm a lesbian and I just really needed to vent about something here. 

Obviously there are a lot of misogynistic traditions when it comes to marriage (the bride being ""given away""  and taking the husband's last name) and especially in the past it would just trap women and they would be there husbands and that should be addressed because it's important, but sometimes I'll get a bad vibe when that's all feminists (especially straight ones) talk about when it comes to marriage. Because I've seen plenty of times where they will just go on and on and on about how marriage is solely benefiting a man without acknowledging the fact that not all women marry men. It just feels like they're excluding a major struggle some women have had to face, and to me it feels like they're just reinforcing the idea that every marriage is between a man and a woman. And not to say marriage is for everyone or you should believe in it! But I want to get married and sometimes when I say that to a straight woman and hear that it's just reinforcing patriarchal society it makes me feel icky because I don't plan on marrying a man. And I don't think this is necessarily their intentions, but it just makes me feel weird (when that's all they say not talking about it in general). Sappics already get excluded so much especially lesbians because we don't pursue men. Basically I just wish that if you are straight and addressing the topic to just acknowledge that not all marriages will have a man/woman dynamic.

Sorry I'm not really the best with words and I'm typing this on my phone but I hope this makes sense, and I can't speak for all gay woman but this is just my feelings.",1614923635

Feminism,"I am a feminist, because of the time I wanted to wear a dress and my mom told me not to, because I'll get raped.

I am a feminist, because I can't walk alone at night without being afraid something bad could happen.

I am a feminist because of my dad who constantly tells me, and not my brother, to go cook and clean because that's what I'm supposed to do.

I am a feminist, because my hole life I've been taught that guys teasing on girls and being straight up rude and mean was romantic, cute, and something I should like and feel good about.

I am a feminist, because of all the people who think that having ""no"" as an answer is only for playing hard to get.

I am a feminist for the equality between men, women and all the people who are just in between.

I am a feminist and I support all women, regardless of their attraction, skin color, assigned gender at birth, body type or career/job, because we're all amazing and beautiful.

And as a feminist I also support men for being who they are and having emotions, without having to be ""tough"" or ""strong"", and for crying just like any other human being.

So yes, I'm a feminist.",1614896116
Feminism,"Arguments for and against this mentality? I personally fall into certain communities that say things like this a lot,but it also sort of implies woman are unable to make any choices without male input? (This is a hot topic for why women do SW etc). In particular being in anti porn communities these sorts of statements seem to come off a little weird to me (and they come up often.)  


P.S This view is not necessarily my own,I'm just scared I'm reading into swerfy/misogynist reddit potentially and would obviously like to not be a part of that.",1614895749

Feminism,"Hey feminists of the internet, this is just a rant about my dermatology appointment today. I was really excited about it, but it was one of the worst hospital visits I think I’ve ever had. When I went into the room, a male doctor (still in med school) looked at me before my actual doctor. He was extremely nice and asked before he touched my face, back, stomach, legs etc. and talked to me about what products I was using and all of that stuff. When my actual doctor came in, she looked at me for maybe 2 minutes and then decided that we needed to get the accutane process started and that I needed to start birth control and these other 2 medications along with this topical medicine. Additionally, when she looked at me, she pretty much touched me where ever and pulled down shirt so that she could see if I had boob acne, without asking, which caught me completely off guard, and the male doctor was in the room, and I’m a minor. When she started talking about how I need to be on birth control so that if I get pregnant on accutane, my babies won’t be deformed, I freaked out (as one would). I had just fought my way out of all of these stupid medications that made me feel like crap, and she wanted to put me on more?!? So she asked me if I had any questions, and I started crying because I was so overwhelmed. She then asked why I was crying, and I told her that I didn’t want to be on birth control. She asked me why, and I responded with “because I don’t want it to make me more emotional” I would have said more, but I was having trouble breathing because I was crying so much. She then told me that it wouldn’t make me more emotional, and then asked my mom if she had any questions, and then left. The male doctor was still in the room and talked to me about how I could just start with the topical medication and that birth control doesn’t work for everyone. The woman doctor came back with this contract for accutane that I had to sign about how I couldn’t have sex for 6 months. I signed it, but made sure that It didn’t lock me into taking any medication. I’m just so fed up with doctors.",1614882601
