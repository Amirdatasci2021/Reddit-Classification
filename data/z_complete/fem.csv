Feminism,1615740158,As a straight white male ally Atleast in the southern states I can say men do not hold men accountable That s personal experience but I stand by that statement 
Feminism,1615739896, Calling out   blaming Yes all men should be called out to do better because we can and we should  If you re doing everything you can that s great   Keep it up  And make sure to hold those around you accountable as well If you re doing everything you can then you shouldn t feel personally attacked by this  It s literally as simple as that 
Feminism,1615739759,Yes This tweet and many of the replies are broad brushing men 
Feminism,1615739588,Yes Some of us do This tweet is using a broad brush and I don t think that is helpful to affecting change 
Feminism,1615737847,Just listen When you do hear or notice something speak up And if you don t then just listen 
Feminism,1615737801,Nobody is blaming men as a collective here  I am a man if you think this is post is calling you out it s because you re part of the problem 
Feminism,1615736738,I m gonna go ahead and say the intervention part isn t true I had a friend who casually told me a story about how he basically sexually harassed a girl and when he was called out on it his only response was the get mad and defensive I m gonna go out on a limb and say most of the guys with these tendencies towards women will not react well when called out even by men This isn t to say it isn t men s jobs to call out toxic behavior just wondering how we can realistically correct it if the people perpetrating it don t want to hear it 
Feminism,1615736102, When  in   men are shit and the other  do nothing they might as well not fucking be there  is a quote I think about a lot 
Feminism,1615735849,What exactly do you want me to do  Be specific and provide examples 
Feminism,1615735572,What exactly do you want me to do  Be precise and give examples 
Feminism,1615735229,What exactly do you want me to do  Be specific and give me examples 
Feminism,1615735147,Pretty sure women are more likely to be assaulted by a friend or family member than by a stranger 
Feminism,1615734147,It basically tribalism     people stick  up for those they feel empathy for whether they be men or women or animals I do agree though that women needn t be trusting of men who are strangers It s  simply not worth the risk So if this makes them unfriendly then so be it They needn t bother 
Feminism,1615733456, gt then why aren t all men helping women in ways that would lessen the violence women face That s my point The OP and many others like you demand that literally every single man act in a certain way That s absurd There are many ways to effect change and support without following your demands  gt Misandry does not even exist Yikes  gt I just know you re racist in the way you refer to black people as  blacks as well as stereotyping Muslims as terrorists Honestly I can see why you would say this because it does feel a little rough coming off the tongue But the verbiage has been very fluid over the recent years and there really isn t an accepted term yet People of color colored people black people blacks African American etc all offend someone for some reason Know that I acknowledge that but saying I m a racist because of that is a way to try and dehumanize me so you don t have to address my argument or simply ignore it as invalid The Muslim thing was also part of the point I m making Reading comprehension will tell you that I don t believe Muslims are terrorists The statement is terrible and very bigoted However I simply crafted it using the exact language of the original post to make a point This tweet OP basically says  all men are the problem in some way  How would that read about blacks whites Muslims women etc  etc 
Feminism,1615733421,It s  very counter productive to blame men as a collective Most intelligent decent people will not tolerate harassment 
Feminism,1615733207,Probably not  all       but  many  Feels like a some kind of competition or a revenge on men honestly To make such broad and stupid assumptions Maybe women should hang out with more men Feels absurd to read these threads as a man who doesn t witness that much harassment in social circles nightclubs or such environments And if it happens it has instant consequences 
Feminism,1615733177,I know for a fact women do not have talks with daughters about men s safety
Feminism,1615732852, We dont know which men is the slam dunk argument for me I dont know how people can t understand this concept
Feminism,1615732465,There are absolutely men that stand up and advocate for women s rights and safety It is unfortunate that you haven t met any and that makes it obvious that there aren t enough men doing that But they do exist
Feminism,1615732305,I am glad to hear it I think your experience may be somewhat unusual but not impossible

Feminism,1615731749,I know this is a serious matter and I agree with the message but I surely can t be the only one who first read it as  no tall men and got really confused    D
Feminism,1615731672,No I honestly don t Maybe I m just lucky or maybe it s a cultural thing  I m from the UK but I just don t know anyone like that Granted I m also in my   s so chances are people my age aren t often the problem over here 
Feminism,1615731031,You don t know men who treat women badly Do they make sexist jokes Do they really treat women equally Believe them fully rather than playing devil s advocate as if women are constantly exaggerating and lying for attention or to get an advantage It isn t enough to not rape or kill women That s the entire point of the post 
Feminism,1615730693,Too little too late I woke up a few days ago to check my social media to be attacked by    of people that I use to call friends People posting stuff saying  all men are responsible all men are complicit  Because of  what some sick psyco did to some poor woman in London It is not my responsibility for what some random stranger does Period I know who I am and I choose to spend my time with good honest people I don t need to influce the  bad men because I don t spend my time with those kind of people It is not my responsibility what strangers do I was lucky to be brought up by an amazing single mum that taught me right from wrong She is a saint  It is not her responsibility for what a stranger does I was a feminist until a few days ago Feminism has lost a good ally And I can t be the only one  I want to thank a lot of friends that targeted those kind of men in their posts And didn t attack and blame good people    Feminism and any other political activists don t do enough work to stamp out their respective extremists It s those extremists that make people lose faith in that cause The exact people that you actually need on your side The irony  I no longer consider myself a feminist I will continue to do the right thing and campaign for change but I will not do it under the label anymore  Seriously fuck you  Don t waste your time commenting on my post because my notifications are turned of
Feminism,1615730691,I ve seen it in my group of acquaintances  I m very deliberately not calling them  friends   Some of them are fairly decent when talking one on one and almosr none are ever outright shitty when talking in front of the girls but when it s only the boys around it s open season for all the misoginy body shaming and anti feminism imaginable  And the less shitty more reasonable among them are dragged along as well because you want to fit in On the other hand any criticism is met with open resistance from the ringleaders I ve distanced myself from them I ve come to the conclusion stopping them or reasoning with them is out of my reach and only further fuels their narrative I try to keep touch with the ones I consider my friends still to keep them grounded away from that extremism I m not saying this is always the case but it s heartbreaking seeing previously reasonable people radicalizing and being powerless to do anything 
Feminism,1615729379,I m not sure what the point of this is I don t think anyone is disagreeing with you here No not all men are going to defend you But plenty will Not all men are going to stand up to their friends and family against predatory or harassing behavior but many will What exactly is the ask here You aren t satisfied until all men become allies This simply reads to me as attempting to guilt trip all men based on the actions of some This also comes across as incredibly misandrist It s true that not all blacks harm Asians But do all blacks work to make sure their fellow blacks do not harm Asians Do they interrupt troubling language and behavior in others Do they have conversations about Asians safety with their fellows Are all blacks interested in our safety It s true that not all Muslims are terrorists But do all Muslims work to make sure their fellow Muslims do not terrorize Do they interrupt troubling language and behavior in others Do they have conversations about religious tolerance safety with their fellows Are all Muslims interested in our safety How do those read to you 
Feminism,1615728964,Nice word substitution puzzle game you got there bruv it s a shame that in real life context is important words and their histories are important and by flipping words in a tweet you can t magically reverse centuries of oppression But you do you apparently tone policing is a high priority activity for you I won t deny you your small joys in life

Feminism,1615726703,This touches me deeply I just had a discussion with my brother and dad about this They just don t understand My dad think that he is going to protect me from everything and my brother is focused in not all men They didn t listen when I tried to explain to them that while they don t physically harm women they need to change their behavior regardless of jokes the way they talk to my niece  boys don t cry and stuff and their lack of listening to us women
Feminism,1615726524,They don t exclude portrayal of gender roles but Kelly Reinhardt s films usually subtextually comment on them especially in Meeks Cutoff and Certain Women 
Feminism,1615726495,Hmmm   Replace the term  Men with other religion ethnicity race etc etc And it comes off as being discriminatory as fuck 
Feminism,1615726293,I think a big part of the problem is that the men who treat women like shit often group together and validate their behaviour within those groups I can t honestly say there are any guys I know who are or have been shitty to women  to my knowledge  And that s another part of the problem I don t know how my friends treat women when I m not around It s hard to call someone out on something if I have no idea what s going Best I can do is lead by example whenever there s an opportunity to do more than be passive and hope it s well received 
Feminism,1615725872,As a man with narcissistic tendencies myself who hopefully didn t cause any trauma or anguish but certainly was unstable in past relationships it s very common for me to want to publicly display somehow that I m  reformed and think people will see that and fully change their mind about me I personally have stopped myself every time and realized the moment I do that will be a complete disgrace to the movement and everything I ve learned from it  I have absolutely  sympathy for myself and others like this I just imagine this sort of thing is really common Just another opportunity for men to take over what belongs to women and expect credit and praise while not having to deal with the stakes of it 
Feminism,1615725746,If everyone actually did what they could this would no longer be a problem Maybe you do but maybe someone else dont
Feminism,1615725672,Another redirect See This is the actual problem She raises a question and you go WHAT ABOUT THE WOMEN Taking away yet again focus It s just another way to say  not all men 
Feminism,1615725561,That s the thing the day the men says enough to the abusers it will stop right away If your friend acts badly towards a woman at work and you tell him they buddy I don t accept that kind of behaviour He will literally never do it again the shame to lose face in front of another man But as long as the abusers friends look the other way or even laugh it s consent enough to even make him escalate his behaviour It s obviously not enough with women saying stop 
Feminism,1615725475,I agree still you have to consider that all this information is not reaching the people it is supposed to reach Some random teen encounters part of it gets into a twitter argument with a few trolls and then starts to think that feminism is about hating all men A possible ally is turned into a misinformed bystander and people on the fence are driven towards misogyny 
Feminism,1615725118,Hmm we do what we can to make it safe for the people  we care Unfortunately we can t stand up for everyone 
Feminism,1615724929,Oh have you decided to pretend you were joking because your insistence that your volunteer work makes you more knowledgeable about abuses committed against women than women themselves wasn t working Get the heck out of r Feminism You clearly are not a feminist 
Feminism,1615724699,Valid point but do all women do that too I can promise to you that I m more worried about the effect my mother will have on my niece than my brother
Feminism,1615723881,Sadly I think the answer is no not all men do stand up for women It s one thing to say you believe in equality and fair treatment and another thing entirely to call out your closest friends and family on harmful behaviour Personally I don t know of any other guys in my life who have actively stood up for women myself included if I m being honest 
Feminism,1615723815,I should be able to express whatever I want about my trauma publicly without being bullied and re traumatized If you don t support women healing in the ways they choose to I suggest you leave this group 
Feminism,1615723103,How many women have you through your own actions helped escape abuse  I can honestly say the number for me is in the hundreds  Yet you call me a garbage human being because I m offend by an overtly sexist comment  What the fuck is wrong with you  Go do something for some one else you worthless self important piece of shit 
Feminism,1615722678,Honestly you sound like a clown and have nothing but bad takes I ll fuck myself with whatever I d like and your shit brand of shock  humor is about as edgy as a sphere people have been using it since they invented language 
Feminism,1615722220,Yes abusive men are a problem  So is assuming all men are abusive  It was a crass utterly tasteless joke made out of frustration  Sue me 
Feminism,1615721827, the actual victims of abuse I ve worked with have acquired a pretty keen sense of  which men   If true then what you re saying is   women need to just sense which men are bad but also that women who do have this sense are not saved from abuse anyway With that solution being flawed shouldn t you agree that abusive men are the problem not women wary of abusive men 
Feminism,1615721422,Honestly you wouldn t be able to pass any screening I know of to be anywhere near victims of abuse  I m pretty sure the only one pretending here is you  Take your fake outrage and tie it inro a cute bun then fuck yourself with it 
Feminism,1615721176,Yep  It s a sad dynamic and it was a crass joke 
Feminism,1615720969,What the fuck are you talking about I never not one fucking time said anything about any of my feelings let alone the one you just invented  Nowhere do I say anything about feeling like I ve been treated poorly  What an absolute shit show of projection to cap off your entire thread of bullshit you made up and attribute to me I m sorry but I m done with you  If you really want to know my  story there s eleven years of my post history for you to peruse  Go back far enough and you ll find your  whattaboutism   And if when you get there kindly go fuck yourself preferably with one of those hoses you re seem fixated on 
Feminism,1615720427, gt Judging by the number of repeat clients it would seem  which is their type  This is pretty well researched in the field of psychology It s an aspect of trauma bonding a person within a traumatic relationship   abusive harassing sexual violence anything like that   will sometimes become dependent on the person abusing them Which can happen for however many reasons often gaslighting or simply not having a way out   it s safer to become dependent than to completely isolate yourself and to put yourself into a potentially more dangerous situation by leaving You can just google trauma bond if you want it explained in better terms Once the victim of this leaves the relationship however they ll often get into relationships with other abusive people Not because that s their  type   which is just a sickening thing to say honestly nobody goes out of their way to find abusive partners   but because the traits extant on their previous abusive partner that they  fell in love with will also be extant on new potential partners The trauma bond doesn t magically go away when you leave a relationship and if you became bonded to a person who was emotionally negligent and ignored your interests then its easy to become attached to another person who is also emotionally negligent because that s simply what love looks like in your traumatised experience It s also that abuse can decimate your self esteem So you leave one abusive relationship but can often feel like you deserved the abuse or at least don t deserve true love so you re willing to put up with other abusive relationships because at least then you re not alone with your own poor mental state

Feminism,1615718664,The only problem here is men like you demanding women police their words 
Feminism,1615756726,It s incredible how fast the conversation was diverted into  not everyone is like that  just like in BLM Everyone needs to understand that this is a global cultural matter It is not a question if   you  or someone you knew have abused women harassed women beat women killed women or cat called women This is a behaviour that young girls had to learn to protected themselves from The whole  boys will be boys kind of comment come to mind in which people just passively allow this behaviour to happen If you think this is not okay and want to do something about it then be vocal about this with your peers be an advocate start the conversation discuss it in depth bring it up and say that for you this is not okay This is not a woman s issue it s a man s issue 
Feminism,1615756555,I really like this It s long past time we raise the bar for what it means to be a good man It reminds me of  There are two kinds of evil people in this world People who do evil stuff and people who see evil stuff being done and don t try to stop it

Feminism,1615754284,This feels uncomfortably similar to  this     To be clear I m very pro refugee and I disagree with the skittles analogy which is why the similarity is uncomfortable 
Feminism,1615753891,It is just so wild to me that my mom  amp dad spent my whole life insinuating or flat out saying men only want one thing don t go walking at night get nervous about me living alone and then scoff when I m like I m wary of ALL men and don t understand why I m so particular about dating Like what did you think was gonna happen 
Feminism,1615753850,Curious about your hashtag of   to many woman  Is it short for  annoying to many woman or  a pest to many woman  or perhaps  unsurprising reflexive misogyny directed to many woman  Actually that was a rubbish guess This game is fun 
Feminism,1615753759,Same argument with  not all cops are bad  I think of that particularly after seeing the news about the Met police roughing up the crowd that was there for Sarah Everard s vigil the other night 
Feminism,1615753746,I like the idea behind the analogy but I feel it falls flat because the only real relationship we have with ticks is that they carry Lyme disease while men women relationships are very very complex and it can be alienating to suggest men don t care and or aren t doing anything about women s issues  I think what you mean to say is something like  not enough men  meaning not enough men are calling out abusers rapists etc because it doesn t affect them as much as it affects women This is a message I think  practically all men can get behind The disconnect comes from the fact that men as a whole need to do more but men as individuals feel absolutely powerless to change anything and it s demoralizing to treat men like they don t care on the whole 
Feminism,1615753146,The Bro Code by Barney Stinson a very interesting and useful book
Feminism,1615752923,Since you only care about single statistic     U S Census Bureau which revealed that in      a study of a percentage women and men who admitted to forcing sex found that     per cent of that subset were women compared to     per cent of men     college study of    men and boys which found that   had been sexually coerced into unwanted intercourse with   per cent of the perpetrators reported as being female    toManyWoman
Feminism,1615752184,No because its not my responsibility nor obligation to deal with the malicious behavior of those who  happen to be the same sex as I Are all women  required to stop other women s bad behavior I certainly don t expect them to because they re not affiliated with every other woman on the planet The same goes for men

Feminism,1615748089,As a man no far too many men don t But I do and I ll be teaching any children I have to do the same 
Feminism,1615747797,This this this Generally I fear men far more than I feel protected by them without a doubt They ve collectively traumatized us    
Feminism,1615746719,I don t personally think this is a man vs woman thing For instance I doubt many women have step up for a man when they see their wife belittling them in public Or that many daughters have discussions with their parents about the importance of men s emotional mental well being But that doesn t make all women coabusers  What s going on is called the bystander effect When you are taught cpr you are told that you can t just say  call     to a crowd No one will act You need to say  hey you in the white shirt call      The key is to transform it into a personal responsibility issue Otherwise people of both genders will just stand idly by and watch  So in general we need to create a better society with more empathy and personal responsibility We need to create people who will stand up and act against injustice when they see it whether it be related to sexism racism income inequality etc And we need both men and women doing that if we want things to change It s so so hard as people are wired to be risk adverse and not sacrifice themselves for others So rather than blast people for not standing up we should frame it in a way where we praise the people who do People like to be praised and get defensive in the face of criticism So I think with these types of issues you go with the carrot rather than the stick
Feminism,1615746338,I understand that sexism against women tends to happen more often than against men however if you are really looking for true equality surely you should still be asking the same question about women when there is sexism against men Both are a problem  Would just like to add though that I do still believe every point here is valid however it is unnecessarily targeted at one gender and I hope I don t have to point out that that is the sexism you claim to be against

Feminism,1615740212,This list doesn t do feminism justice as there s barely any mentions of all the great  side effects of feminism any LGBTQ issues racism or intersectional issues in general  which admittedly the lack of used to be a huge problem within feminism and still is in large parts  It also doesn t bring up anything about how feminism has progressed the discussion about gender in academia something which I suspect is very undervalued In other words it focuses on specifically men s issues that are not related to sexuality race etc The intention is not to say feminism is equally about men as it is for women it does certainly focus on women and is completely fine doing so but the point is that the larger majority of the movement do care and that there is an expanding space within feminism that can and do talk about it Solving men s issues help women and vice versa  though my personal opinion is that it s most effective to do both  The goal is to give feminists an easy resource to refute claims about feminism not caring about issue x or men in general hopefully if the mods want to add it to the sidebar as well as asking for more sources articles on how feminism

Feminism,1615776292,This is something I have been trying to do   Honestly I catch myself mostly   It just reminds me that it takes continual effort to change 
Feminism,1615776061,Yup I get really pissed when I see an insta post that s like  girls guys   insert stereotype  like holy shit what s so hard about putting  some before it What s so hard about not generalizing
Feminism,1615775871,Yes and I feel as if over generalizing of people  amp groups is the cause of a lot of mis understood issues nowadays 
Feminism,1615775771,Exactly Said it on another post but gonna say it again because these posts keep popping up Not all men is used as a derailing tactic They know what they re doing The more you spell it out for them in posts like these the better their strategy is working We are teaching and wasting energy engaging with dumb arguments rather than actually discussing more pertinent issues Stop humouring them and let s get back to having actual fruitful discourse in the FEMINISM subreddit 
Feminism,1615775719, gt And who are responsible for constantly perpetuating those stereotypes Everyone is responsible not just men Come on this is basic feminist theory that you re getting wrong
Feminism,1615775440,That is a good point I think the problem with the post is it is singling out physical harm instead of just power in general Expanding it to power makes a better point but the tick analogy doesn t cover it very well then It s also is a bit too much of a blanket statement  But it s enough to keep us in a constant state of fear  This is saying that all women are always in fear because of the potential of physical harm from men  I guess the question is who is the target audience If it s meant to show people who don t understand what you explained it doesn t do a very good job You however summed up what it should have said very succinctly I think it s very easy to say men have many different types of power over women and almost all men have abused that power even if only minimally It s much more relatable and less polarizing Anyway I m new here and if I ve come off as ignorant please let me know I m here to try and be less ignorant 
Feminism,1615774979,I don t like generalization I see through the intentions of those people who rush to say  not all men to downplay women s problems But when a person says something bad and adds  all men to it then I really think that s wrong Isn t the point to just get rid of generalization entirely 
Feminism,1615774929,I think when people say  not all men they re trying to call out the fact that some people think  all men are fucking idiots and  all men can go die in a hole  Nobodies saying women should just stop worrying when they go outside in the dark and worry about being sexually assaulted 
Feminism,1615773659,Thank you for spreading awareness you honestly never know who you can reach with this message and how they can become inspired to make a change Here s to collective responsibility for improving women s safety  lt  
Feminism,1615772401,I mean    this isn t an original post they still have guardians in some countries 
Feminism,1615771680,I wish some of them had juuust this much self control
Feminism,1615770462,I just wanted to come here and say that men are not monsters we are humans U guys have created this narrative that men do all the wrong and women are absolutely blameless for their actions While  women dies at the hands of a bad person does not mean all men are responsible for his actions Young men die everyday and as a young man u have a higher chance of dying in the street then women We are not monster stop trying to demonize masculinity Its  women who died why don t we bring up all the wives that kill their husband s and get away wit it 
Feminism,1615770178,It s true that  notallwomen falsely accused men But do all women work to make sure their fellow women do not falsely accuse men Do they interrupt troubling language and behaviour in others Do they have conversations about mens safety consent with their daughters Are  allwomen interested in our safety 
Feminism,1615769706,The difference is about power dynamics and what the agenda is  When it comes to violence against females the group with less power is developing safety strategy based on frequent experiences so they don t continue to be harassed by those in power  The agenda is equality  In the case of refugees the group with more power is bullying the group with less power using isolated incidences as examples The agenda is political power  perhaps sprinkled with white supremacy  Essentially those in power should not abuse their power As a corollary it s vitally important we all recognize where we as individuals are in power and where we aren t A same person can be in different categories for different issues  eg a male refugee is in power as a male and not in power as a refugee We should help him out as a refugee but call him out if he mistreats his wife  
Feminism,1615768995,All people have a duty to work for the betterment and safety of others 
Feminism,1615768959,I think it would make a difference if we started to really acknowledge the mental health and substance abuse issues that contribute heavily to violence against women 
Feminism,1615768817,I mean I m sure there are men I would consider or at some point have considered friends who do those things but they don t do any of that around me I mean I m not really a man but most people only know me as one so maybe it s different for others but I think a lot of times men who do say and do this shit know who among their friends they can get away with being open about that with 
Feminism,1615768758,Kinda late out here but look up the Polgar sisters They re kind of like real versions of Beth Harmon women who made it to the highest echelons of competitive chess 
Feminism,1615767957,Cap I m not a baby sitter not responsible for the shitty behavior of others  Or can an individual woman really not take care of themself    I swear none of you are actual feminists
Feminism,1615767435,Yeah not all men are abusers but enough are that its a problem
Feminism,1615766185, gt He will literally never do it again That s incorrect Is this anecdotal or just something you assume would happen if a guy was called out because that has NOT been my partners  m experience    When he s called guys out for bad behaviour he s been met with denial anger brushed off and laughed at ignored and very commonly gets ganged up on by other guys in the group who also feel attacked because they do say the same shit Any other time he gets along with these same guys really well just not when he s calling them out   My partner sells cars and deals with a lot of sexism and monogyny among the salesmen and mechanics An example of behaviour    Woman comes in to deal with the company for whatever reason mechanics get all excited and start elbowing each other encouraging each guy to try get a look even if it s to go into an area they normally aren t in talk about what they d do to her partner hears it and tells them their behaviour is gross and desperate they laugh and tell him to basically F off he s just emotional white knight SJW etc    Second example Partner was out of town for training along with another dude when they go out for dinner before returning their hotel Not long after partner learns this dude has a GF he sees him on Tinder trying to hook up with multiple girls for the ONE night they re staying there Partner calls him out gently saying  that s messed up     it s been a year and half now and this dude hates his guts still and tries to mess with him   Last example His friends he grew up with used the word  gay to express annoyance disgust boredom etc He decides to call his friend out on it one day friend thinks it s a joke and not serious keeps doing it multiple times until he realised partner is serious sort of stopped doing it for a while before going back to it because he  has gay friends who said it s ok so it s ok  Didn t have much to say when my partner responded back that both him and I are bi and my brother is trans and we re actually not ok with it It s toned down now but it hasn t  literally ever happened again like you want to believe    I m not attacking you or your ideal situation because how freaking great would it be if men DID just need one talking to by their mates before they changed their behaviour Sadly that s not realistic though It takes people a while to accept they might be wrong about their long term behaviour and longer to rewire the brain  especially the older the person is  I mean would you instantly change when    people never had an issue with your behaviour over   years but now one random friend is saying you re not actually the nice upstanding person everyone else said you were 
Feminism,1615765312,That s just blatantly wrong Nobody should be assaulted in anyway and yes women are victims dramatically more often but this type of comment does nothing to change anything    
Feminism,1615764330,I read it it s indeed a cohesive study But the solution in the conclusion doesn t put the blame on the idea of  false perception of female innocence but the fact that gender stereotypes put many of those men in positions where they are unable to identify their own abuse And who are responsible for constantly perpetuating those stereotypes     Gasp   Men did you shot yourselves in the foot and now you want to blame a statistic on women even when your own article concludes the problem is a male made issue unless you want to argue that somehow women were able to perpetuate those stereotypes 
Feminism,1615764053,Uhhh   because we don t care for being harassed assaulted raped murdered etc I know women am I right   
Feminism,1615763947,Plus  speak to your sons Make them a better ally and they ll be stronger men and happier people It s not a zero sum game 
Feminism,1615763844,My book What English grammar   I think you re trying to troll feminism but realising that grammar pedants are a far greater threat  Feminism is cool tho 
Feminism,1615762194,I have a question so why do I always here women being scared of men when it s dark in the streets
Feminism,1615760803,standing up for women didn t stop me getting raped by one I don t understand these rhetorical statements of course not all men are interested in this as not all women are interested in treating other women or men as equal shitty people exist everywhere and it doesn t matter what gender they are 
Feminism,1615760616,says the person who cannot find any counter argument to change my mind of course I have other thing to do than speak with ppl that disagree with me but cannot find anything to change my mind good luck finding gender equality with such methods cause if you can t explain me how I m wrong when I m all ears of course I won t agree with you
Feminism,1615760040,Yes it is absolutely your responsibility to call out sexist comments and jokes towards women not doing anything about it leads to desentisization of sexual assault and rape therefore less likely to take sexual assault and rape seriously which is why women talk about their greviances men don t believe them In the UK    of young women      years old have sexual harassment it s not women s job to fix this it s a problem with men and it is our responsibility to flattern that percentage not taking reponsibility as you said makes you part of the problem
Feminism,1615759940,You re only showing your ignorance Since you re so insulted I m sure you will find something else to do 
Feminism,1615759843,says the person who is straight up insulting me  and no it was not useless I m showing my disagreement based on facts hoping people would be a little bit open minded but I guess insulting strangers is waaaaayyyy more useful
Feminism,1615759691,This is a really good start u LapisRS I wish more men would simply   ask  the way you re doing    You might also listen to the women around you when they complain about things men say or do Or ask those women about it giving them a safe space and making no comments when they answer you There are obvious things that men say and do that range from inappropriate to harmful but there are also things that may seem innocent but make a solid percentage of women feel uncomfortable or unsafe For example a while back I complained to an otherwise pretty forward thinking male friend about how hard it was to find a boyfriend to which he replied that maybe if I smiled more and let strangers approach me I d have a boyfriend Stuff like that 
Feminism,1615759428,And as a woman I can believe that because most men that I ve encountered have been very respectful to me 
Feminism,1615758532,  If you read and understood the comments you would know not to say something so monumentally useless 
Feminism,1615758500,Ok but men don t owe you protection Thats it thats why Do you jump to protect men No you don t 
Feminism,1615758351,ok so you re making the assumption that all men do these things and that s not true  I am an exemple at least no I read only the comments not the responses so I had a global idea of what feminists wanted to say and how they are thinking
Feminism,1615757346,or maybe you didn t find the right partner we all got our ways and there is probably one person there that like the same thing as you
Feminism,1615757343,Probably an unpopular opinion that will kill my karma but I m not sure that all men having a duty to be the protectors of women is feminism This reads more like   th century coverture 
Feminism,1615757265,the username is a pure joke don t use it as an argument and don t think you re smart cause you pointed it out  i m not saying you are 
Feminism,1615757126,Congratulations You ve never had to deal with the men you know in private when they re horny  I m sure you re scrolling backwards through r feminism to be super helpful 
Feminism,1615756956,as a man who was raised among men I can tell you that nobody says that I never heard that in whole my life
Feminism,1615756873,U S Census Bureau which revealed that in      a study of a percentage women and men who admitted to forcing sex found that     per cent of that subset were women compared to     per cent of men     college study of    men and boys which found that   had been sexually coerced into unwanted intercourse with   per cent of the perpetrators reported as being female   toManyWoman
Feminism,1615782474,So you re really saying that women just don t uphold gender roles Ok where does this wild theory come from

Feminism,1615781201,I wonder if we re due for this kind of discussion to remind us all why stereotypes are immoral and undesirable We all grew up being told not to stereotype whole groups based on individuals that prejudice is bad but a lot of us probably haven t spent much time weighing the pros and cons because it is just seen as an obviously awful thing to do full stop Then enough time goes by that someone can openly advocate the textbook definition of prejudice and there are some people who go  yeah you know what stereotypes are actually pretty useful I wonder why we ever stopped using them People are like ticks if enough are bad then it s ok to act as though they re all that way makes perfect sense  
Feminism,1615781167,Black people commit a disproportionate amount of violent crime in the US By the logic of OP s info graphic it would be fair to said  black people are criminals and when called out on it retreat to  well no no no I don t mean  all black people I m just using general language to point out a trend  It s ridiculous Generalizations are harmful We shouldn t make them about men or blacks people or Syrian refugees

Feminism,1615780465, gt This is true though Whenever I am walking in the dark I  am always in a constant state of fear Even it s not dark and I need to walk past a group of men who are loitering there is a baseline fear always  My smart watch will show a sudden increase in heart rate  Ya I see what you mean there It s an odd dichotomy that men can both make women feel safe and also fear just by being present I was picturing walking with my wife This would make her feel more safe However I m sure she would still have some fear walking past a group of men even if I were with her Depending on the situation of course Plenty of food for thought there Idk I guess it was hard for me to identify with the core of what the post meant And then I see comments like some in this thread basically saying that if someone doesn t get it now they never will Well I didn t get it and you helped me understand I know there are people who fight against this and  not all men is a tactic I feel like at a glance it s a damn good tactic for someone who doesn t want to understand Someone who doesn t want to examine themselves gets a free pass because they aren t violent Now if they re not guilty why get introspective Anyway what I m trying to say is thanks for not being dismissive and taking the time to articulate the subject 
Feminism,1615780403,This argument would also work really well to support a lot of really heinous forms of bigotry like anti semitism as acceptable because  in the eyes of the anti Semite the Jews are the party in power and have the control Or poor white people and affirmative action or men going through family court Just because a group thinks they have less power than another group in a particular instance does not make stereotypes and sexism morally acceptable 
Feminism,1615780175,I just don t think so I owe no duty to you unless we enter into privity Also the post was sex specific It assumes either that women need men s protection or that men have a duty to women or both As a woman I don t need a man to take care of me As a feminist I believe in individualism and empowerment via personal responsibility 
Feminism,1615779407,If I did the same thing with the male reproductive organs this whole subreddit would go ape shit
Feminism,1615779365, when  in   women are only out for the money and the other  do nothing they all are out for the money  Wrong quote  Changed men women Changed shit money How is that quote even a aurgment I used the same aurgment with different nouns and verbs It could apply to so many different things and more clear as to why it as a aurgment basis Doesn t make sense So all drinkers are responsible for all drunk driving deaths  No it s only drinkers are responsible for drunk driving  The whole party isn t responsible for the lesser  of fucked up individuals 
Feminism,1615778730,Good idea for a comic and I agree in principle but this is cringe tbh As feminists we really need more affective talking points than complaining abt teenage boys who say  not all men  It s a fine talking point in spaces primarily for women but it s bringing no men over to our side unfortunately Talking about the  in  women and  in  men and other rape statistics I think is a much better way to converse about rape culture We  need better consent education regardless of assigned gender 
Feminism,1615777906,Oh absolutely I used men in my example because I see them get defensive more but you re right in that it occurs from both sexes quite frequently
Feminism,1615777830,Yeah i guess I was also talking about girls too I don t like it when anyone stereotypes generalizes either gender
Feminism,1615777690,Couldn t agree more Most of these arguments can be avoided by just saying   some men do  x  instead of  men do  x   Imagine actually being able to discuss a problematic behavior with someone because they don t feel personally attacked or accused    That being said the  some is often implied and simply not picked up on 
Feminism,1615777524,Yep this Exactly this See also  a few bad apples instead of understanding the huge underlying systemic issue and way too much injustice 
Feminism,1615777200,It s also similar to racist talking points  Replace the  men with any other group and it s really obvious 
Feminism,1615776949,All analogies are just proxies of the actual issues and they often remove the context My point was that comparing  different analogies doesn t always make sense because the context can be very different  ie power dynamics  I agree that for the same issue you may need different analogies to get the point across to different people In this graphic I am interpreting tick bites as an analogy for  all types of harm  physical  amp mental as verbal abuse is still abuse   gt This is saying that all women are always in fear because of the potential of physical harm from men This is true though Whenever I am walking in the dark I  am always in a constant state of fear Even it s not dark and I need to walk past a group of men who are loitering there is a baseline fear always  My smart watch will show a sudden increase in heart rate  
Feminism,1615797935,I think this thread sums it up Stereotypes and prejudice apology is the right wing approach The left wing one is that it s not men as individuals who are the target of criticism but social structures 
Feminism,1615797646,Some issues are very much gendered though and sexual violence is definitely one of them So yes everyone needs better education but this could be interpreted in a genderblind kind of way which would be a mistake  not that I think that s what you meant by this 
Feminism,1615797641,Someone called this sexist and the comment as well  Takes all sorts  
Feminism,1615796812,as I explained in a similar  thread    gt Now  progressive people will say that it s not the same when it s applied to  a minority or oppressed group and rightfully so But the thing is we  don t all agree who s the victim and who s the oppressor Both TERF and  the superstraight nuts think they are oppressed by trans people Fascist  believe jews are the oppressors and immigrants are invaders and so on  If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not  just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor Surely no fash  believe all jews control the media or whatever 
Feminism,1615795220,Aside from a few factual corrections  as far as I m aware men are punished more severely for all types of crime and are more at risk for violent crime although I could be wrong  I m curious as to why the distinction of privilege is significant in this case I acknowledge readily that racial minorities have been and are oppressed by white people as a class I acknowledge that women are oppressed by men as a class in some respects although unlike with race this relationship is much more fuzzy Nonetheless if I am determining whether or not to cross the street when I see someone of a certain racial or gendered characteristic coming why does it matter if the class the trait belongs to is the oppressive or oppressed group 
Feminism,1615794977,So would it be justified for me to distrust all poor looking people or racial minorities because similar statistics exist for their perpetration of crime or not Is it acceptable to judge individual people based on data about their social class if the price of trust is your own safety  I m asking this in good faith this isn t a  gotcha moment or anything 
Feminism,1615794745,I completely agree with this pic but man it s gonna be weird being a cop and still holding these opinions 
Feminism,1615794226,Ticks don t have feelings though Being innocent with to ill intention but being treated as such is unfair It s like saying all humans are murderers because some are 
Feminism,1615794063,Not the same thing  Cops are supposed to stop such things  If I see someone catcalling or discriminating a woman most of the time the best I can do I is voice my opinion Cops have the authority to stop other cops from doing illegal things 
Feminism,1615793897,No With  all men it s  too many men  With  all cops it s quite literally every single last cop because that s what the job is 
Feminism,1615792517,Except it is all cops The ones who do their job properly and follow the rules are still doing something immoral They re using violence to uphold an unjust social order on the behalf of the rich and powerful Even the nicest neighborhood beat cop is doing that
Feminism,1615792188,As a man I ve been bullied by other men for defending women in certain situations I honestly don t even wanna bring up some of the situation because they re extremely triggering  both for me and also women here but all I can say is be mindful of the way men treat women be mindful of how women feel in the moment and be mindful of the dangerous realities that women face every day 
Feminism,1615792106,I m so glad those pieces of shit conservatives got kicked out in WA Biggest loss in history apparently Now we need to get them out of the government and make them obsolete Can t believe people have been supporting rape enablers for this long When will people learn conservatives do not care

Feminism,1615791806,Comparing men to ticks is not a good way to win over people  The best way to refute  not all men is to point out that feminists aren t saying  all men are bad in the first place it s the men who are trying to discredit them by unfairly generalizing and trying to turn this into a purity test  bad men vs innocent good men  Feminists say that some men are actively bad many more are disengaged and unhelpful often going along with the bad guys and that more broadly there are broader forces like masculinity and gender roles which can t be discussed in terms of individual guilt and innocence 
Feminism,1615791507,   Damn you both have some great perspective here I couldn t agree more with everything you guys have said and I support women who think this but just because I saw this brought up somewhere else I thought I d help clear it up here    I should preface that I hate the argument that I m about to talk about its based on racist ignorance and doesnt take into effect the context of America s negative history    People  not just women have been trying to find a parallel to this point by arguing that they should similarly be more afraid of black men because they are more likely to commit crime in their area The difference between the arguments is the context that Black people have disproportionately been forced in poorer neighborhoods and been oppressed in the workforce Essentially the crime comes from living in poverty not being black  e g  a third variable  The context as you said seems to play a particularly large role in understanding these types of social points and the variables that cause the social distress Do you have any thoughts on this I would love to hear anyone s perspective on how this point is isn t relatable to the point about men because I ve been arguing with racist family on Facebook about this these last few days I sure could use more help because their sexism and racism is extremely stubborn and frustrating     A follow up point the argument used against men  may be most applicable for anyone scared to walk down the street in an impoverished area at night As a Brazilian American I always avoid going to certain areas of my city in Brazil because they have more crime These areas just happen to be the poorest areas I by no means hate poor people though similarly to how the argument against men doesn t mean that women hate all men There s just strong information that informs our actions to be careful in these social situations    Even though the point above and the point about women fearing men seems fundamentally the same there is a huge difference again it s context The situation with poverty can be changed much faster than the situation with men this is because of how the situation with poverty has been constructed differently If the government just heavily funds these poorer communities we can simply eradicate these criminal differences without the need for more policing which leads to more unnecessary death I don t give a shit if people think my idea is socialist BS  most Brazilian family hate me for thinking this way  they can suck my socialist butt The situation with men cannot be fixed that easily I hope that all made sense I m tired af writing two   page neuroscience research papers studying for exams and barely getting by financially Life honestly makes me so depressed and exhausted but you all make me feel more confident that we re moving in the right direction

Feminism,1615790637,Okay so the way I look at it is that rather than criticizing men focus criticism on male socialization behaviour So directing anger towards the systemic patriarchal structures that foster toxic male behaviour rather than the general male population That being said I want to clarify that when women make the decision to avoid be guarded around men it is not the same as prejudice Prejudice is hatred or discrimination based on affiliation with a  harmless group while being wary of men is based on the very real threat that they pose to women

Feminism,1615784296, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action

Feminism,1615804720,This   This doesn t reference any particular group of people as being the source of the problem This was not an attack on men 
Feminism,1615803224,Gotta say if the feminist group wants more men then why not change the language from  men are rapists to  too many women are being raped  It s understood in both that it s mostly men who are raping women but the second one has a better chance of getting normal men to join the cause
Feminism,1615802737,Not sure if you read OP s question before it was but he specifically asked  how is this  it s not all men but we don t know which men different from saying not all black people but we don t know which black people  I provided examples on how it s not the same and how that felt like an obfuscation and a dogwhistle Comparing yourself to a maginalized and oppressed class when it s convenient to spin a narrative while ignoring the systematic injustices against said class versus the systematic advantages to another to smokescreen and counter an argument that men commit violent crimes against women and try to whattabout the argument into race baiting nonsense is really scummy to do on a board about women s issues and the amount of mental gymnastics required to say  you aren t allowed to talk about your safety or the danger men pose because it s akin to racism is absurd As to your point nobody is going to ask whether or not crossing the street to avoid a man is racist if that man is black versus white except for people fixated on that person s race so your scenario is a bit confusing Are you implying a woman who won t cross the street to avoid white men but will cross the street to avoid black men and women Yes that s racist  If a woman crosses the street to avoid a man regardless of race she s doing what society expects of her to  keep herself safe as it always comes back to when a woman is harmed  She should have been more aware of her surroundings she should have dressed differently she should have crossed the street when she saw someone approaching her she should have blah blah blah and other ways it s not the man s fault for harming her but her own fault for existing But then people want to say  not all men  despite it being a woman s fault for not suspecting it could be all men It s an absurd circular argument that could go round and round forever and everyone is tired of hearing it So to me and a lot of other people it s all men and that s not an issue of privelage or class it s a societal mandate issued by the government who refuses to prosecute men for their behaviors and teach women how to be afraid rather than teach men not to be abusers Women must keep themselves safe because the answer from policing and government agencies when they don t is  she should have suspected all men and acted in accordance with that

Feminism,1615800899,I think the analogy is really powerful At first I thought it was dehumanizing but on second thought I realized it really wasn t it wasn t blaming men or comparing men for ticks it was just explaining the mindset of women who suffered through interactions with toxic and predatory men BUT it s so hard to realize it sometimes I understand that it s not a real comparison but It s kind of triggering to think you re being compared to bugs given that dehumanizing campaigns around the world have compared other groups to insects

Feminism,1615835197,we already know we really really do But criminals exist most men would help any person in danger but most criminals dont do criminal things with witnesses around   
Feminism,1615834769,Holy crap me too kind of I wrote my dissertation on the depiction of the female nude with the main focus on  Olympia by  douard Manet During my research I came across John Berger He helped me a hell of a lot I still quote him to this day 
Feminism,1615833496, gt you tell him they buddy I don t accept that kind of behaviour He will literally never do it again the shame to lose face in front of another man I take your point that men who abuse women are generally more concerned about their reputation among men than what any woman thinks of them e g a lot of rape culture is about focusing more on notches on bed posts and establishing an identity as a guy who can  score  than focusing on whether she really wanted to  I am afraid this isn t such a silver bullet though Maybe I ve gone about it wrong but it feels like I m just as likely to be accused of something along the lines of  white knighting  It sucks I still feel like it s my responsibility to speak up and I ve long since given up on wanting to  fit in with such crowds but that just makes me more of an outsider to them It s a hard problem 
Feminism,1615828811,Well yes I don t think everyone is going to     agree on whether a particular group is a minority   gt If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor I think this is a slippery slope fallacy and not quite true We should always qualify whether a group is a minority based on statistics shared experiences and common sense I don t think every claim at being a minority should be validated but some will be If when we a consensus on the qualification the logic still applies 
Feminism,1615827900,It s not just about one thing happening three times though It s patterns of behaviour that are all quite obviously rooted in male socialization Rape is just one example I stand by my argument that distrusting men is not the same as prejudice

Feminism,1615822971,Would you like it if somebody wrote  Women are disease ridden bugs   
Feminism,1615822413,I see what you re saying but the statistics do demonstrate that      of rapists are men while there are no statistics to demonstrate that nearly all thieves are black people or that nearly all child molesters are gay If we knew that      of child molesters were from a certain group  orientation race  of course we would keep kids away from that group And even if that rape statistic didn t exist if a woman has had numerous experiences with violence harassment from men and so have all her friends I think that s enough evidence of danger to justify that  prejudice  
Feminism,1615821402,It s a tricky subject because you re absolutely right that women are just protecting themselves from a very real potential threat but when it is advocated so broadly as it is here it feels like trying to carve out an exception just for one circumstance When THEY do it it s prejudice When WE do it it s just protecting ourselves What about people who cross the street or clutch their purse around black people or refuse to trust their money to financial advisors based on their ethnicity or protect their children by not allowing them to be around gay people They all think they re just guarding themselves from a very real threat The only argument you could make to those people is to say  No no but my stereotype is true I m right about this group over here you re just mistaken about THAT group being bad  Your point about focusing on behavior and social structures is dead on well put

Feminism,1615864420,I m not buying it either   Not even nudity should be inherently sexualized 
Feminism,1615863034,You mentioned that you don t blame guys for this because they grew up with that Implying that boys grow up thinking a certain way  amp I feel like you giving it a negative connotation In you negative experience with someone flirting with you I don t know how pushy the guy was so I can t judge you on your personal experience but if you handled it with an aggressive matter that it didn t match the guys approach then I would consider it fiesty as well But considering you were underage he s a dumbass When it comes to jokes it just depends how much you take it personally I ve had people roast me  amp talk shit but I dont care at the end of the day because their words don t affect me  I don t let it get to me No matter what it is But that s me it just depends how vulnerable you are to things like that I mean if someone has an opinion of you being  feisty it WAY DIFFERENT FROM  ALL MEN SHOULD DIE   Those are two completely different scenarios one of them could possibly potentially dangerous Saying all men should die is threatening it could signal that the person could have a mental illness I mean most hate crimes occur off such word like that  Calling someone  fiesty is not even close to ALL MEN SHOULD DIE  Quite an extreme example Hoodies sweatpants  amp sandals are quite extreme tbh but it doesn t mean that there still ain t some sort of parameter that both females  amp males should follow I mean at the end of the day he s a man Men are attractive to women SURPRISE Obviously if he sees a model on ig he s going to naturally be attracted to it Of course if he s a heterosexual or bi You can t blame him for admiring female beauty But see the difference is models are paid to do their job  amp there job is to look  attractive  I bet that he wouldn t marry someone like that tho because men are very selective with whom they want to be with for the rest of their life So that s where the whole women should act like ladies comes into play Because if your not a model you shouldn t be so explicit That s goes for both men  amp women I mean many men are upset of this feminist movement where they feel like they are being generalized as something they aren t I mean having women generalize that men are rapists violators  amp sex offenders does hurt men to hear because not all of us participate in that horrendous behavior Many of us do put a stop to it  amp call it out even if its with the  boys  Guys know when guys are being assholes some of us do control  amp tell the homies to back off So when you got people coming at you or your type of people it hurts It does affect our gender to have to deal with such harsh claims 
Feminism,1615860218,Dude that s not it at all did you see my other messages  I said I absolutely do not blame guys for this Heck I ve had this conversation with him before and we ve agreed and disagreed He talks the exact way We both blame society for both genders being f caked up Today he talked to me about it the same exact way he didn t change his opinion at all And with school dress codes people took that Too far Why do they still consider knees and shoulders offensive Why is that still a thing And I was defensive back because he started with the defense in some messages previously before the ones in the photos If guys can be defensive we can too Also just because they re  jokes doesn t mean there isn t more behind that Calling it a joke doesn t completely cover everything up That s why jokes are offensive because there is Always something behind it There was a guy who was hitting on me he was over age and I m underage and I made that Very prevalent to him and when I told him off for continuing he called me  feisty because I told him he was wrong  He s allowed to have an opinion but what if certain opinions are blatantly wrong like morally and logically wrong In every way It may seem right to that person because that s how opinions work but what if someone says  all men should die would you like that opinion Would you think that s morally and logically correct Also I said I partially agree with his opinion that intimate clothes should be kept with romantic partners But that doesn t mean all women should only wear hoodies sweatpants and sandals Because that s what he thinks But then he s always sending photos of these girls wearing straight up lingerie for likes and says it s hot   He can t make up his mind I have dealt with this opinion for a while now but I got fed up of him saying it Over and Over and Over again saying girls are all thots and such And him purposely being sexist and purposely upsetting his friends over it for fun when it s clearly a subject that has an affect on our gender 
Feminism,1615859711,Right I agree with most of what you said except for   gt Capitalism may be part of it but non veganism is the real issue You basically answered it below that sentence the only way you get to decommodifying animals and liberating the exploited whether animal or human is by first collapsing capitalism If everyone became Vegan there d still be very poor treatment of animals regardless because of industries that use animals for products however if capitalism falls we are able to start a transition to decommodifying products and necessities if you want to go further we can move to growing meat in labs we have already done it but capitalism prevents us from actually making it something to sell on the market This way you have a transition to a free er and more ethical society

Feminism,1615852984,Yes but in the context of the discussion I think more men would be willing to acknowledge systemic violence against women if those issues were also acknowledged  I think many men see statistics on abuse etc and think of it as something they would never do which in their mind diminishes the severity Educating people about why violence against women is still so widespread can help change their perspective 
Feminism,1615849489,You know mental health issues and substance abuse contribute to violence against everyone 
Feminism,1615848842,I know right he s always complaining about how short girls skirts and shorts are dude WHO DO YOU THINK ARE MAKING THOSE CLOTHES I think it s pretty clear women don t have any input when companies are producing those clothes It s all men He complains about it but loves seeing girls wearing that stuff  Like make up your mind

Feminism,1615848361,I define sexual exploitation roughly as using another sentient being for their sexuality reproductive system or sexual capacity in some way whether by overt or subtle force  One need not actually derive pleasure sexually from the exploitation that they are forcing on someone else  e g farmers in the dairy industry do not necessarily get pleasure from it but they still do it  That definition can be refined but I am referring to essentially the ideal of viewing the sentient being as an object and specifically a sexual one What I mean by women betraying other women women who would themselves be at risk of the suffering I am referring to but still choose patriarchy over doing the right thing Women who do FGM Women  and everyone  who aren t vegan Women who traffick other women  or men or children or whoever is being trafficked  Women who join in on misogyny when they are around male friends   amp  x   B I am not referring to someone sexualizing themselves but that may be a part of it Mainly I was referring to the systemic exploitation of women and especially female animals Capitalism may be a part of it but non veganism is the real issue The solution is a paradigm shift in which women are viewed as legal persons and not as objects and a world in which animals have legal personhood and are not used as commodities in any way 
Feminism,1615848231,He literally doesn t do shit He doesn t care Conservatives need to be make obsolete in Australia or else we will be going around in circles 
Feminism,1615847930,I agree with everything here however I have some questions What do you mean by sexual exploitation What do you mean by women betraying other women In my mind I know what sexual exploitation is being forced convinced that doing something you re uncomfortable with sexually because it s  empowering  however I think there s a difference between someone choosing to sexualise themselves and someone who s actively being forced or persuaded into objectification  With that said I think the only way to solve everything you mentioned is to abolish capitalism once that falls you ll see other oppressive entities falling as well with the rise of socialism 
Feminism,1615847024,We need a name for them that sticks like gorilla glue You need to stigmatize that behavior 
Feminism,1615844417,The main reason that  is used is when generalizing statements are applied to men eg   men are killing women  Although the intent of the writer is probably to say  some too many men are killing women  without that modifier in front the true meaning of the statement is that  men in general are killing women I think that men have a right to defend themselves from statements like the one above that generalize the entire gender Generalizing statements are not really fair when applied to anyone and usually result in unnecessary prejudice and judgement   Not all     are       but enough of them are  is not really a good rebuttal in my opinion You cannot justify generalizations about groups of people just because they may be accurate in some cases Try filling in those blanks with any other identity group besides men and it becomes clear why men respond defensively If a muslim hears    Not all muslims are wife beaters but enough of them are  used as justification in order to group them in with wife beaters they will defend themselves from that prejudicial generalization 
Feminism,1615843216,No it isn t too many More than    of men have never done anything like that You keep defining them by their gender instead of their actions Call them bullies catcallers and rapists but stop generalizing a population of over  billion based on the actions of less than    of it If you want to define criminals by their gender no woman should ever be fit to be a parent because the majority of child homicides and child abuse is done by women But when it comes to them you rightfully call them abusers and murderers instead of generalizing them by their gender Give us the same courtesy

Feminism,1615841754,If he is generally a kind supportive partner then I d be inclined to assume this is just a bit of a blind spot for him and a very clumsy attempt to make you feel less scared  My fiance is a good listener and tends not to give unsolicited opinions on stuff but he has his blind spots and he can be pretty useless emotionally sometimes lol  The important thing I ve found is to just tell him when what he is doing  or not doing isn t hitting the mark For example he tends to just want space when he is stressed out or emotional so his tendency is to give me space  ie basically ignore me when I m emotional  At first I found that incredibly hurtful but over time we both learned that we just have different knee jerk approaches to things so we need to ask for what we want Now when I m emotional or upset and I want to be comforted I just tell him that   I m really upset right now and I want you to listen to me and comfort me  It sounds so ridiculous but it works and he does a great job And when he needs space and I m all up in his business trying to get him to tell me all his feelings he asks me to please just let him do his thing In your case I d suggest you tell him that the way he responded made you feel dismissed and that you want him to be more open to listening to your perspective on issues that affect you as a woman like being afraid to walk alone at night See how he responds to that If he gets defensive call him out on it and bring the focus back to you just trying to be heard and have your emotional needs met 
Feminism,1615841712,This is what I always think whenever NotAllMen stuff comes up These men act like rape is the only issue we care about and that it exists in a vacuum Rape is propped up and encouraged by the things listed in this tweet  it exists within the context of rape culture which exists within the context of patriarchy This is a system that we are all apart of and we have all perpetuated at some point in our lives Solutions come from admitting our faults and working to change the system  not drowning out conversation by shouting about how good and innocent we are

Feminism,1615880706,Because gender and the power imbalance between the genders are intrinsic to violence against women and the reason it is allowed to continue  Terrorism is not intrinsic to islam  its intrinsic to extremist ideals and various other factors   If you dont see that but would rather get upset that we have to share the responsibility of the benefits we receive from a patriarchal society that calls women hysterical when they report abuse refuse to prosecute men because her word isnt enough and then imprison them when they act in self defence I m afraid there is little point in this discussion

Feminism,1615868858,So if I m understanding the question Should people be more afraid in a financially poor high crime area I think we can disregard race but obviously people will use that as an excuse to single people out Violent crime is clearly one of symptoms of poverty but it isn t a limiting factor You don t need to be poor to have power and abuse it I think maybe violence is the most accessable form of power So in a poor community violence or at least the threat of it is a quick and easy way to have power where you otherwise have very little Of course you have the flip side where the powerful can use violence simply because they have power I think the relationship is all other things being equal  which they are not  most men have the availability to exerte power over most women in the form of and threat of violence Maybe poor communities are the same in that regard The greater potential for violence is baked into the society if you will  And well not all fear is rational We are certainly all afraid of things that will do us no harm We are also unafraid of things that can or will do us harm But the the perceived potential causes very real fear Sometimes that fear is rooted in bad things like racism Anyway don t listen to me too much I ve written and this about four times now My points feel week and I m not even sure I know what I m saying But you put some time and effort into your post and I wanted to reciprocate Hopefully this is far enough down in an old enough post no one else will ever read it

Feminism,1615917383,Honestly is not that much different from any other form of fiction Japan has never been specially on the vanguard of feminism equality and many animes are at its core the product of just one person s mind which can be flawed and I believe the majority are men There s also the clich and vicious circle of being written for male audiences which alienates female audiences which in turn feeds the male audience excuses I believe it ll get better as every other media has 
Feminism,1615916098,Actually you re right Thanks for understanding my point as well I was just thinking that since not everyone would actively help someone who gets assaulted by which I mean that if it happens on the street the big majority of people would just turn their backs it s a pretty relevant thing if they actually call the police or help in any other way  But yeah there are also cases in which it s only the bare minimum such as like you said speaking up against racism or correcting a friend for rude jokes

Feminism,1615915316,Or make a nonsense naturalist argument and make silly comparisons to animals  like chimps where males are supreme you know how like people   th century justified colonialism and slavery 
Feminism,1615910985,I agree in some ways and not in others First of all everyone going vegan would result in animal exploitation industries to collapse and move to other alternatives since no one is paying for their services And if a tipping point is reached and not everyone is vegan they may be toppled sooner Whether or not capitalism is also toppled may be irrelevant and even if capitalism is toppled that does not mean that the world will be vegan Most anti capitalists are not vegan and and most discussions about capitalism are done by people currently using animals as resources They are willing to give up capitalism but if asked no way would they give up their animal products The underlying beliefs that animals should be used as resources for food clothing food and experimentation is not necessarily a capitalist idea but rather an imperialist and colonial idea that others should be slaves  might is right  capitalism comes later  Therefore we need to get rid of the underlying speciesist belief first and anti capitalism cannot be divorced from that AOC is against capitalism and she s not advocating veganism as a moral baseline Bernie Sanders is against capitalism but no way would he give up  his animal products

Feminism,1615986081,Totally and utterly disagree  We can always refine and improve how we communicate these things and in order to do that you often need to try to express an alternate view 
Feminism,1615983673,I think a lot of it also has to do with inherent habits that have become normalized for instance the locker room talk Men do it amongst themselves and talk about such horrible things but aren t called out in fact the popular verdict  men will be men is thrown around Well men are being allowed to become misoginists 
Feminism,1615981271,First of all most developing countries in the world sustain themselves off of vegan staples such as beans rice legumes grains Meat and dairy is a luxury Of course there are some people who simply cannot access any good food at all but that s not a why veganism is flawed argument that s just another way in which our global food system is injust  to animals and to humans clearly  As well we currently have enough food to feed   billion people but we choose to use those crops to fatten up animals whom we then murder  turning them into products that go primarily to well off individuals in the west If we care about the fair distribution of foods globally veganism is the only coherent option Can you go vegan Are you vegan Often people point out someone else s disadvantage as a way to say  well that person over there is disabled poor etc and they can t go vegan therefore I am not going to go vegan  This is illogical and it s also selfish to use someone else s disadvantage to justify your own inaction I agree toppling capitalism would be beneficial but again it s an ideology of non veganism that is the primary issue I agree humans need to be liberated as well but that also translates to  We are humans who oppress and slaughter billions of animals and I refuse to liberate those animals until I have my own freedom  We can all choose to not oppress animals by being vegan and most people can go vegan  And if they can t go vegan there are things that are not related to their diet that they can do not go to circuses not buy pets unless they re adopting not buy fur and leather etc  And yes getting rid of speciesism is a huge step in the right direction because that would mean everyone or most of the world has gone vegan and therefore there simply isn t any demand for animal exploitation because everyone has declared  I am vegan I will not willfully participate in animal use and so all corporations and countries would be forced to change  of course it s more complicated  Again there aren t many anti capitalists who are vegan and those leading the political fight  Bernie AOC in the American case would not further veganism since it s not something they perosnally practise

Feminism,1615968872,I  think that by adding cloths it s not possible to find any solution and that  the solution actually goes in the reverse way to remove them without clothing it s not possible to define what s provocative to wear so the  provocation moves to the behavior that is the best definition And actually when people is full naked  in a naturist nudist environment gender differences blur out and on top it removes sexuality that is the other  driver of inequality 
Feminism,1615967662,Disclaimer I am not a feminist I am all for equality but I do not associate myself with the feminist movement in any regard I just enjoy having discussions with people who disagree with me on contraversial topics Disclaimer  electric boogaloo I also haven t watched JoJo s Bizarre adventure I ve seen the character designs though I completely understand your point of view on JoJo s Bizarre adventure the female characters are complete sexualisation and it s disgusting But the male characters also incredibly sexualised  from what I ve seen there might be some characters who aren t  they re all tall muscular jaw lines and confidant looking in posture and body language Sexualisation goes both ways but from what I ve seen one people will tend to only see it towards their gender When I m watching marvel films for example I honestly don t notice the sexualisation of the female characters but I see the sexualisation in the male characters eg Captain America and Thor Now I completely agree that JoJo s Bizarre adventure is too sexualised but it goes both ways and I just ask that when anyone calls out sexualisation they take a look to see if the both genders are sexualised because most often both are 
Feminism,1615967649,It s called  hetero patriarchy  The vast majority of healthy population want a system based on social justice and that of course includes no abuse nor discrimination However a minority wants to keep privileges and for that it s critical to them to abuse the rest and avoid the logical rebellion  This is very hard to sell as such so the narrative works a lot better when it s sold as an abuse chain  So the   privileged class abuse the     but to a percentage      of that    there is giving the other half to abuse The first half are the men and the second are women To the men is told that to protect their privilege above women they must also protect the   privilege And most men bought it Of course that   also spike it with more stuff like nativism racial privilege etc   but the thing is it s really easy to give to each man a woman to abuse because the proportion is     It s not so easy to give to each male a racial slave So women abuse works very well Then the rest of the narrative it s just for filling in victim gaslighting extremism labeling to whoever points the reality intimidation to shut up and keep playing that impossible to win game etc

Feminism,1615952525,It is not possible for everyone to go vegan there are people who can barely afford basic greens thus are restricted to cheap food Not to mention when you live a life that s stressful like that they won t break away from something that gives them a bit of pleasure Capitalism being toppled means there s more incentive for ethical ways of consuming things like I said the chances are there d be more of a push to have lab grown meat and it would be beneficial to have that since no animals will be harmed  I disagree you can t just get rid of speciesism and go from there it s not pragmatic I d need to see evidence that it is in order to see that as another option of toppling the oppressive society  I think our goal should be to liberate fellow human beings first as long as there s a large power above us they ll make it harder and harder to allow people to go vegan why Because it puts a dent in profit people are addicted already and with busy schedules of the working class most people cannot afford to go into the vegan lifestyle right now

Feminism,1616874278, gt One of the interesting points not illustrated in this graph is that the amount of money an occupation pays is significantly related to the  of men in it Well of course it is it s an average of all jobs whether male or female dominated Of course summing this up will show that men make more because there are more fields dominantly men than there is women and the men in those positions are making more than the women in other fields of work How is that unfair   gt It s that work that is thought to be masculine is more inherently valued than work that s thought to be feminine These issues are certainly related but it s interesting to see how deeply the pay gap is integrated into the workforce Have you done any research into why the gender pay gap exists There s many more variables than just simply men make more Ive  worked in the trades with women who make the same as I do can t produce the same as I do but still are paid the same the same as men who can t necessarily produce the same There are many female dominated disciplines where women are paid very well the same as men sometimes more The pay gap is more complicated than just simply it s not equal men make more than women  Take nursing for example predominantly female paid very well not more or less than men in the field but based on their time in the field to a cap then raises with the rise of inflation the same as their peers Equally governed trades which are    dominated by men women are not paid less they are paid the same but you have to introduce more variables than just masculine vs feminine valued work to get a more conclusive depiction of why there is a   wage gap Search any countries occupational breakdown by gender and you ll see the clear divide of which gender fill jobs more than others and if you understand the major differences between men and women as a whole you ll know why the gap exists we are different in two such ways that s makes us choose certain careers But you also have to take into account simply this     do women want jobs in these fields that are dominantly men most cases no If it was the latter you would be forcing equality of outcome and I don t think anyone wants that in a world where many factors decide who gets a job and the opportunity Women who are firefighters when compared to men make the same amount of money or have the same opportunity to make the same money Not all women want to be firefighters you need to be a certain type of person to work in the field women aren t built for it the same as men biologically speaking they don t have the same muscle mass testosterone aggressiveness   but does that mean for the women who do work in those fields do they get paid less of course not  I just fail to see where your argument and frankly anyone else who doesn t see the clear divide of male dominated work that is more masculine being paid more Well of course because there are more men working in the field so naturally they will be paid more as a collective driving the average up    Is it so hard to believe that Childcare workers for example are predominantly women     and those women are in that position cause they want to be there or dental assistants which make up       How come more men aren t in that line of work I m sure Burly Lumberjack Bill wants to be a childcare worker    no he doesn t because he s aggressive by nature and women dominate those fields because they have more compassion and you don t want aggressive Bill playing around in your mouth There are      Carpenters in Ontario compared to      dental assistants Should the carpenters get paid more than the dental assistants in terms of job not by the determination of masculinity or femininity but danger of the job working in the elements Of course they should and it just so happens that it is a very labor intensive job would a large percentage of the female population do that job    no it takes masculine traits now whether you agree or not the fact is biologically it is a masculine job does that mean that females are inherently undervalued to perform such work No they choose not to do to such work There is an inherent difference when it comes to equality of outcome and equality of opportunity Misreading something that isn t fact and projecting it as something else is not understanding or educating yourself properly on the issue 
Feminism,1616873218,paraphrasing here but something along the lines of  if feminists are so strong we shouldn t let men affect our emotions

Feminism,1615991831,For real   in honesty I want to hear this person either   defend this horrid position they re attempting to take or   admit they are just defending the  wElL AcksHuAlLy BS that has no place in a discussion about racism and sexual assault
Feminism,1615991768,My last sentence where I say my point is that it isn t necessarily from a lack of care is what I was trying to say You hear more people are dying and you think lack of healthcare services discrimination shitty doctors whatever but if the population is growing obviously the rates of death will go up too But on top of that people are getting sicker cases are getting worse so again not necessarily due to a failing healthcare system though in the US it s certainly a contributing factor 
Feminism,1615991328,There s only so many times I can hear acKsHuaLly    in one day 
Feminism,1615990989,I m all ears to hear your  well thought out position about how sexual assault and racism aren t bad 
Feminism,1615990887, gt For me I appreciate devil s advocate in a scenario where I don t know exactly where I stand but I want to press the person to explain more why their position is appealing But this often results in bad faith arguments because the person is arguing a position they don t hold often by claiming a position of authority that they don t actually possess It s much more honest imo to just say  I m not entirely sure on my position yet My concerns with your perspective is x y z  That sort of articulation is helpful in building the trust and respect you describe 
Feminism,1615990855,What do you think sexual assault is Also I m still waiting to hear the  racism is ok sometimes nuanced argument  And the  sexual assault is acceptable when argument  
Feminism,1615990712,How about devil s advocate as a tool to find a more nuanced position for yourself This must be expressed in a respectful way in a context of trust but surely in such a scenario it can be useful to express tropes  which possibly you are inconclusive on to a person in order to allow them to better explain a well thought position to someone less well thought 
Feminism,1615990565,The original tweet doesn t reference  rape is bad it says there can be no devil advocate position surrounding sexual assault or racism So that is to say that in no way is their nuance to be found in how every single person thinks about every aspect of both those concepts Obviously nonsense 
Feminism,1615990365,lol can t argue that i m not a white dude having theoretical discussions however the idea that a white male is not impacted by gender sexism and the discussion surrounding those concepts is total nonsense It s a shame that there are some who would wish to respond to those who take an interest in experience outwith their own as attempting to frustrate them purely because they defend the concept of an honest devil s advocate 
Feminism,1615990187,Right here     Completely and utterly disagree to      Without genuine trust and respect though it is true devil s advocate is useless in any scenario even more so in ones where the knowledge produced is used to oppress and subjugate as knowledge associated with race and gender often is     You asserted something to be devils advocate to the OP Then you backed off of it immediately proving that your first assertion was the  bad kind of devils advocate 
Feminism,1615989974,How have I abandoned the position My position is that devil s advocate CAN be useful Where have I abandoned that argument 
Feminism,1615989741,So    what s the alternate to  rape is bad   racism is bad  Do tell 
Feminism,1615989730,Your first comment completely disagree when discussing racism and sexual assault we  absolutely need someone to play devils advocate    Your second comment playing devils advocate can be beneficial in some scenarios but there s a nuance to it    Pick a lane friend 
Feminism,1615989366,So when you  play devil s advocate  you re quite literally repeating the status quo telling us stuff that we already know  because not only do we too live in this space and time and therefore comprehend the norms of this cultural and historical place but we also are actively thinking outside of that box which first requires us to know that box really really well And you re not so radically reinforcing that we should remain in that box  
Feminism,1615989327,Devil s advocate does not have to be a case of someone asserting themselves then abandoning a position but I agree there are many who do that For me I appreciate devil s advocate in a scenario where I don t know exactly where I stand but I want to press the person to explain more why their position is appealing For example as a kid at a Catholic school the anti abortion message was drummed in quite hard Abortion was something I struggled to take a coherent position on in which I was always comfortable but it was noticeable that the science led of my peers were pro choice To pick their brains without knowledge of biology it was necessary for me to say  It is impossible for you to define logically when is fine to abort and when is not if you ignore the point of conception as that line in order to access their knowledge of the reality of the development of the fetus in the early stages as basically a tiny clump of cells and not a living human being in a womb Without genuine trust and respect though it is true devil s advocate is useless in any scenario even more so in ones where the knowledge produced is used to oppress and subjugate as knowledge associated with race and gender often is 
Feminism,1615988852,No I don t believe these deaths include homicide I ve seen it anywhere from homicide  usually by husband bf lover being the cause of    of all pregnancy related deaths Heart disease being     But numbers may be different now 
Feminism,1615988441,Introducing alternative views sure   but to what end If it s about anticipating counterarguments or adding genuinely needed nuance that s fine but that s not really playing devil s advocate If it s  I m going to assert my intellectual superiority by arguing a position that I don t even hold or that I deny holding when challenged  that s insincere and counterproductive and can do real damage in an organizing context 
Feminism,1615988278,Well as a man I disagree because not all men and blah blah blah  s

Feminism,1616930748, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action

Feminism,1617014272,Commenting to show solidarity It is something you can never unsee For me it was the intersection of misogyny and anti Black racism  misogynoir that really opened my eyes to the ways in which our current world is failing women Audre Lorde bell hooks and Mikki Kendall are so inspiring to read But it is bitter medicine and it has its side effects    It was especially hard when I would talk to friends about this HUGE societal problem and it would somehow not matter much to them Like how can you see how this casual misogyny is harming half of the population and just shrug It s tough not to feel lonely and like a burden sometimes because nobody wants to talk about it You often feel like a  downer for simply stating the truth It sucks     Well you re not alone You re in the right place and you are correct to be tired and upset We all are That s because this fight is completely and utterly exhausting Even more so for women of color indigenous women trans women disabled women the intersections therein and for any other women in underserved and underrepresented communities    It s okay to be tired It s okay to care this much It s okay to take breaks so you can keep fighting Be kind to yourself and others    My favorite quote that galvanizes me when I start feeling like you describe is  When you are neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppressor   Desmond Tutu    I would also recommend the amazing science fiction writing of the late great Octavia Butler Her world building always makes me feel better     Keep going We are with you

Feminism,1616977818,   Like point   it is watching an objective skill level of under   s boys playing which no one does   Women professional soccer teams play at a skill level less than that of under   s mens  proven many times just google womens national team vs under   s mens  So although comparably elite against each other for the consumer it is equivalent to watching under   boys playing which no one does    Women s sports can sell but it happens that most of the consumers of sport are men and therefore the women have to appeal to men  maybe there s an entire untapped female audience which could shift things   Examples of elite females selling at the same level of men are Ronda Rousey and Amanda Nunez Although comparatively rare they garner the exact same respect as men of the UFC because of how outstanding they are I think one other reason they are so successful is that their fights are on the same card as the men s fights and so the consumer  mostly male don t have to go searching specifically for their fights it s all under one roof Maybe women s football would do well if it was on the same day same stadium as the men s and with one ticket you could watch both  as is done with ufc    Interesting point but I don t have anything to add to it at this stage I would love to see it happen though    You can personally change this You and your friends can buy stadium tickets shirts etc etc  But it won t happen because like point  the consumers are mostly men Not      there are women much more interested in sports than some men but on average a  bloke is much more into the sports fandom

Feminism,1616971085,It s just so alien to me I know a girl who wanted nothing more than to pop out kids and get married the second she graduated school To me that is well    very limited and to my mind pathetic She s a nice girl and everything she married a childhood friend of mine and I see them every now and then at gatherings I m   now and she s about     They have  kids and as far as I am aware she has been nothing more than a stay at home mom all this time since finishing school No real jobs during that time Career what s that Just spends her time parenting though unsure what her quality of parenting is seeing as she had a kid when she was still essentially a kid herself  personally I don t think barely adults  essentially still children should be having children  At that age her brain isn t fully formed and she didn t have any wisdom or life lessons to impart  I m nice and friendly to her in person and all that but she s not  my people at all I disagree with her life decisions and I simply have nothing in common with her She isn t a deep person or an intellectual so I really have nothing to talk to her about as in my mind she is the epitome of  limited   And if I were to say any of that out loud to pretty much anyone I would be branded as a horrible person Oh well sorry that I think people shouldn t have kids until they have made something of themselves  have finances secure housing etc to support the kid and aren t still kids themselves If that s what a horrible person is then I wear that badge with pride

Feminism,1616952715,People previously had to use sick leave  or other forms of leave or some people may have had this in their collective agreement already in these circumstances The new law means that paid bereavement leave  of three days I think for miscarriage stillbirth is a legal entitlement for all workers ie a new additional form of leave guaranteed for everyone  Likely with exceptions eg part time workers may get it pro rated casual employees are very unlikely to get it

Feminism,1617036699,Your opinion does count but if you want to get it across effectively there are better ways to do it Also woman and men stay In abusive relationships for multiple reasons but it s mainly how there manipulated over time I don t think everyone can find themselves in such a situation but some people are more vulnerable to manipulation than others it s a lot to explain I d say research it a little listen to people s stories I only truly grasped it when someone close to me talked about there story 
Feminism,1617036464,I m afraid to get an answer for this but do you think woman can victim blame other women blaming male victims I can kinda see  
Feminism,1617036418,My opinion doesn t count Part of the problem Just because you have a cow doesn t mean you have milk The cow has to be fed You also have to physically milk her You don t buy it but it isn t free   All I know is to many holler about being a victim Get out of that situation Why are women attracted to men that abuse them Then stay with them 
Feminism,1617036312,Damn Athena is truly the perfect example of victim blaming Now that I think about it turning dudes into stone is kind of like a victim lashing out in an unhealthy way You know like isolating themselves or hurting themselves that s not good for them or others and the curse aspect could be viewed as society victim blaming forcing them to do these actions 
Feminism,1617035706,It s cool if you disagree with modern feminism but I just don t think this is how you should go about it Plus insulting people isn t how you get them to see your point of view plus your statement just comes off as pretty childish so no one would take your opinion into account 
Feminism,1617035251,Medusa used to be a human woman then Poseidon raped her in Athena s temple Athena then turned her into a monster for desecrating her temple making her a symbol for victim blaming After she got cursed one can read her as taking revenge on men trying to intrude where they don t belong Plus the snake hair and turning people to stone is just badass 
Feminism,1617035164,These men like natural until it comes down to body hair yellowing aging teeth facial hair crooked teeth All those things are natural but I can assure you people that make comments about makeup are the same ones who dislike all of those things on a female

Feminism,1617026408,I don t have anything to say about that jerk ass millitary man s attitude towards women and the general attitude of millitary organization against the participation of women in armed forces and their delusion that women lowers the quality  whatever that means  I am come from a country where history is witness to many legendary female warriors and queens who with their strategic brilliance defeated their enemies So I know that this quality argument is nothing but sham Here read this interesting piece about women from Cave man times   And show these to those who say women are inferior in terms of physical strength as compared to men I think hunting is seriously demanding activity from both mental and physical perspective and in those times unimaginably fatal So if women could do that at that time of scarcity and ruggedness I don t think there could be any problem in  employing them in military other than the aversion of stubborn higher ups who are all males just a blind guess and their unwillingness to evolve the millitary culture from their self proclaimed ruggedness  which is nothing more than toxicity disguised as Avenue of making you mentally strong Sorry for being a late replier

Feminism,1617019586,It s honestly so sad that they even have to create this It s so easy to not drug someone just keep your hands and stuffs to yourself 
Feminism,1617019013,Yes you absolutely right Countries which are developing and are underdeveloped need feminism more than anything And yeah we especially need to spread awareness about those I ll surely cover it in my upcoming blog Thank you for your advice it means a lot   
Feminism,1617018943,If you ll find a reference to the nail polish please share sounds amazing 
Feminism,1617018411,The biggest problem is that the most common date rape drug is stronger alcohol 
Feminism,1617018274,This is so annoying   like you re putting make up on to please him or any other random dude  I love your reaction 
Feminism,1617017889,As amazing as these ideas are I have found that these things tend to be difficult to afford and or access  Not to mention it once again puts the onus on women to check for date rape drugs rather than expecting men to be accountable and not do it  And it also speaks volumes that date rape drugs are somehow much easier to access  considering how often it happens than these straws nailpolish etc that test for it  Creating it is one thing and it s really great but making it accessible and affordable to more than just a select few is what needs to be achieved  And we also should work to make it harder to access date rape drugs and increase awareness in clubs bars concerts etc  to be aware of spiking and taking precautions to make sure cases are reduced and men who spike are held accountable not the women who failed to buy expensive straws and have it shipped from a foreign country and were therefore drugged 
Feminism,1617016575,I ve been hearing about these goddamn straws for long enough now  they aren t readily available at all I cannot find a link anywhere for purchase or anything beyond  women made a straw Great But where the fuck is it   If you want to help with date rapes then maybe make the products available  
Feminism,1617015489,I named two in the post you are replying to it s right up there
Feminism,1617074244, gt While they are related I think too many of these guys are completely capable of empathy James Fallon in the interview I linked above points out that there are a couple of different types of predators Some are capable of empathy He argues that those who are capable of understanding this are more evil than those who are not He also talks about different types of empathy  empathy with individuals vs empathy with entire groups vs cognitive empathy vs emotional empathy  It s an interesting listen 
Feminism,1617068521,Wouldn t the feeling of getting buzzed be enough to know that you should slow down Though I guess a lot of hear girls are inexperienced drinkers who go by drink count rather than actually monitoring how in control of their faculties they are 
Feminism,1617068335,While they are related I think too many of these guys are completely capable of empathy They just don t empathize with their victims They are selfish and don t see the consequences of their actions beyond that it will help them get what they want  And of course there are those who like the thrill of violence against women 
Feminism,1617065978,This article is terrible The headline is a blatant lie  cannot be found guilty of rape because the woman got drunk voluntarily beforehand this is absolutely not what the court said  The decision Wednesday overturned no it was not overturned it was remanded Please read the comments  here on r politics   for some fantastic information on what this all actually means  I do want to make clear that there is crappy stuff going on with this case and the laws but  it s not what this article is making it sound like 
Feminism,1617065221,Saw this info earlier My first thought was  if a predator specifically targets intoxicated individuals  wouldn t that carry a heavier charge because they are intentionally preying on the lesser mentally capable Does this apply if the attacker breaks into my house when I am intoxicated Or only if I am drunk in public  So basically best of luck if you get drunk and someone sexually assults you 
Feminism,1617063737,I have no idea but this guy s response is awful right As in he s the one getting all this love on tiktok  amp I m so confused Guys everywhere saying he s  spitting facts  Is he saying because we bare children it s ok to call women hoes when we ve had more than  partner 
Feminism,1617062121,It s a hate crime but perhaps we need to consider an effective legal framework for misogyny that stands on its own terms apart from the existing framework of hate crimes and hate speech A very good read on this  
Feminism,1617057220,I don t understand these things do happen to men why does she need support 
Feminism,1617054146,As a woman it is probably not your duty to be an activist I think it s on us men to fix this I understand you will feel bad for all the misogyny but don t feel bad because you think you re not a good enough feminist The only way a woman is not a good enough feminist is if she actively promotes the conservative lifestyle and norms of husband does work and wife makes food You are good enough as you are I think 
Feminism,1617053678,That is horrendous I m sorry your parents didn t have your back on that But I m glad to hear you learned it wasn t your fault 
Feminism,1617053239,The fact that you  have your mom on your side makes you a lot safer too you are less likely to be targeted than people with toxic and unprotective or even accusatory families I know I got targeted when i was very young because when i had a teacher inappropriately acting towards me and I turned to my parents for help  expecting they would talk to the school they said  what did you do to make that man think he can act like that around you  I didn t effing know I was    I know now what I did and that was nothing I did nothing to make that man think he could act like that around me But at the time I absorbed it and thought it was my fault and not understanding that is how things got bad later in life because I thought that behavior in men was normal 
Feminism,1617052827,I get that I have a vaguely creepy odd Walmart coworker who I keep an eye out for  he s kind of clingy without being attracted to me which is just weird to me and my mom even said to keep an eye out for him  When you let your guard down it might happen  whatever  it would be So I completely get the  I happens when you feel like you should be safe  I ve read enough stories on here about women suddenly getting their male friends attention such as after she had a break up to know that even my own male friends could become vile and untrustworthy
Feminism,1617052294,That s ok It s one of those things that if you are expecting it it s less likely to happen when it does happen is when you feel safe if that makes any sense  The end result being you never feel safe ever again so that s fun I m perpetually exhausted now even though I ve become a recluse 
Feminism,1617051355,Oh definitely but if I can purposefully cut off my intake of the most common date rape drug then all the better I m not dropping my guard though Edit Also I definitely didn t read past the first sentence I don t think I had my head on straight or was skimming the comments when I usually read all of a comment before responding my mistake if it sounded very out of place with the rest of your comment

Feminism,1617046461,It s so rare to actually be drugged by those substances though it just makes a flashy headline Alcohol and more conventional street drugs are what s involved in the overwhelming majority of these kinds of rapes 
Feminism,1617045935,This would have happened even if there wasn t alcohol they were hunting
Feminism,1617045553,Both are valid takes rape isnt something that happens in a vaccum and there is usually some level of blame that can be placed on the rapists friends family and the community they were a part of etc for not preventing what happened or not alerting the authorities 
Feminism,1617044366,They re are definitely interesting modern interpretations of those stories that are feminist But given that most Greco Roman mythology was written by men in times when women had very few rights you probably won t find much thats feminist in its original intention To find genuinely pro woman mythology you might want to look at some spiritual traditions from less sexist societies

Feminism,1617164837,I never said that somebody said  women aren t dangerous  I said that they downplayed the danger white supremacist women pose especially to people who are not white As far as I ve seen you ve brought up nothing to contradict this And whilst I think that the idea that white supremacy benefits white  men more than white  women has some merit  racists don t want to be the racial  ubermensch or literally superMAN for nothing  to raise that to level of the claim that white  women haven t played a MASSIVE part in pioneering white supremacy in the ways made available to them through their privileges is again absurd Contemporary notions of  femininity were forged in whiteness and to say that white  women didn t appreciate being the  grandest model of  women  especially well off aristocratic white  women is simply laughable Stuff like black feminism doesn t just exist because of the need to articulate about unique issues  although that does greatly inform it s necessity  it exists because historically whenever they would try to talk about their issues white  women would monopolize feminism to be only about their issues White  women have and will wedge their privilege and drive it into black and other racially marginalized people as much as it benefits their shallow comforts to do so Whilst I do agree that the majority  vast in many cases and situations might be pushing it of violence in the form of manipulation molestation physical and emotional abuse murder and atrocity are committed by  men  that doesn t mean they are always committed without benefit for white  women  No offense but the wives of many of the worst butcherers in history often seemed grandly comfortable with doing nothing to stop the husbands who they might have had the greatest chance to betray provided that it benefited them Whilst I m not so naive to say that this would  kill their empires it would certainly throw a wrench in the sociopolitical machinery that often may have saved thousands of lives even though it may cost their own asides from simply being ethically correct And before you ask yes I would expect the exact same  ethically not statistically of any  man  or anyone for that matter including myself  Although I often fall short of my own ideals of courage  This is where your victim perpetrator binary begins to dissolve itself because people often choose their own victimization for shallow comforts and join in upon the victimization of others for exactly those shallow comforts Even if they don t they often guiltlessly allow them to exist in the best case out of a perverse form of survivalism but more often in my perspective out of a cruel understanding that they will benefit   There is more I have to say on this but I have to shave I m willing to continue speaking with you on this but I think you should think more deeply about your perspective before you self righteously crusade about it to non white people however they might identify 
Feminism,1617163484,All valid points I looked for sources for a grand total of  minutes just to add a bit of substance to the argument but you raise excellent points here 
Feminism,1617163273,Thanks for acknowledging but I still am somewhat hesitant on those racial stats for multiple reasons First it s fairly specific only focusing on mass shooters a category that has an absurd amount of subtypes  unfortunately one only has to imagine school shootings for a type which might skew data about what people typical think of as mass shootings  But that s mostly pedantic Secondarily it ignores that racial categorization bureaucratically speaking is often unnuanced and misses certain aspects  someone who isn t white unfortunately can still be a white supremacist murderer Thirdly and most importantly it obviously ignores the massive amount of injury caused by the police due to their violence focusing on singular targets But if we were to account for it I think we d begin to see how there is no  first and foremost there is only a cacophony of cruelties 
Feminism,1617162724,Ahem for   you might want to reread my statement with less assumptions I m the one saying it s  white men  It s quite obvious frankly I don t know how you missed that one   For   again you would do well to actually read my post well I was pointing out that the post underplays the violence of white supremacist women by saying that  they don t whip out guns and commit mass murder which whilst technically true betrays violence white women very often commit against non white people that OFTEN gets them harassed or even killed such as calling the police for everyday actions   As for   women are technically able to BUY guns just as easily as men but they can t engage in white supremacist gun culture as easily  a big catalyzer for some shooters  Moreover if the only context in which you can easily engage with obtaining a gun is killing people it s pretty well understandable that you will be less likely to go out and get one  and thus likely to plan a shooting spree to begin with Whereas white men have little issues with inclusion within patriarchal racist gun cultures Whilst it is technically equally as possible for women the catalyzing factors for many shooters are far more accessible to men than women You could take a wide angle to this as part of the problem with male violence itself but nethertheless 
Feminism,1617162489,Exactly This is first and foremost a  male issue  over    of mass shooters are male          but it s also a white issue           over    of mass shooters are white  It  has to be looked through both lenses or the analysis is incomplete  This is a white male problem 
Feminism,1617160517,Consider that this is because average gun culture is absurdly sexist in an exclusionary way and not that white  women don t possess similar cruelty to white  men  Just because someone doesn t on average have the capability of doing something doesn t mean they don t want to and I think we see this in the tendency for white women to sick police on black people  often men whilst well aware of the polices penchant for brutality This post is reductive I m not saying that if all women and men had equal access to guns that they would equally commit mass shootings but it wouldn t nearly be as stark a difference This is the same reason why more men are successful in committing suicide despite women disproportionately attempting  At least AFAIK   Frankly trying to downplay the danger of white supremacist women is astounding There is a white supremacist woman in congress who literally implies that their enemies should be executed Again I must reiterate that i m not saying that  women are as violent as  men  because on the whole that s just not true But people who aren t white aren t ignoring the patriarchy by pointing out white supremacists are dangerous They are pointing out the reality of dangers that affect them and to reduce it some petty ideological thing is absurd   I wouldn t be so harsh on this if it weren t for the fact that  it s men to ignore the fact that  outside of the rare islamic extremist attack that isn t also committed by a white convert  it s also  white men  
Feminism,1617157444,I know While discussing this with my husband he started to say the whole  Well there are biological reasons for that    and I stopped him and said  Really How many women have YOU assaulted How many people have YOU shot  He very quickly got my point I told him  it s biology is nothing more than the adult version of  boys will be boys   We ve discussed this sort of thing many times but I think this was the first time he d had it laid out so plainly even though he is well aware that throughout the world and throughout history men have been responsible for the worst kinds of violence  Without a doubt testosterone plays a part in male aggression but as evidenced by the millions upon millions of men who   aren t  inclined to violence it s not that easy It happens because it s  allowed to continue happening Because men are still in charge of most things and men do NOT like having to examine their motives for things because they are often taught that what a man  feels is an actual  fact  driven by logic and reason  not those icky girly  emotions  And then of course there s the whole  violence begets violence thing wherein damaged and hurt women and men perpetuate more violence in their growing children adding yet another link in the chain of generational violence 
Feminism,1617155858,i love how y all separated black women from woc like black women aren t woc

Feminism,1617142809,So because a man commits a crime means that it is a problem all men have Most religious extremists are Muslim that doesn t mean that all Muslims are terrorists 
Feminism,1617142009,Hmm   I would be careful to put it like that  The study solemly shows the behaviour of rats and rats are no humans You can test new medicine on rodents and predict a possible effect for humans yes But making statements about the human psychology based on a study on rats is drastically inacurate  We know what inacurate science did to us women lets not be as bad as men and do it to them as well We are better than that 
Feminism,1617139225,This is better suited for r menslib or r askfeminists Thanks

Feminism,1615716957,I think you coming in to comment on a literal  not all men post about how you feel as poorly treated as a marginalized group of people  who again let me remind you were sprayed with high pressure fire hoses for asking for equal rights in some of their lifetimes because a woman called men around you not perfect on the  feminism subreddit speaks volumes to your perceived victimhood Like you realize the  enough men OP was talking about are rapists and murderers and you re in here like  awh they aren t so bad you shouldn t be that upset by it  Rape is shit and people who stick up for rapists are shit by extension even if it s passively and through whattaboutism 
Feminism,1615716627,I doubt anything you or your man bun profit could say would sink in any deeper than what I witnessed as a child I also doubt you or him have done as much real work helping actual victims of abuse  But don t let that stop you from responding with more condescending crap 
Feminism,1615715604,Since it is a feminist forum I am just reading and listening and learning 
Feminism,1615714825,Because it doesn t suit your narrative of victimhood not because it s innacurate 
Feminism,1615714516,Black people are currently oppressed by our government men usually do and have done the oppressing of women Literally not the same thing Deflection much 
Feminism,1615714290,I am guessing that it might sink in with you if you hear it from a man  Listen to what Chris Hemmings says about  Not All Men   The dude goes into schools and helps young boys to understand so it should help you too   Link  
Feminism,1615714130,I dunno mate   which parts don t you agree with That black people are marginalized based on their skin colour in a society that in their lifetime turned high pressure hoses on them for asking for equal rights That men are treated better by a society that has been set up to favor them for hundreds of years That comparing the two groups as being equally marginalized is as abhorrent and privelaged as it gets Every time a dude does this kind of shit a Ben Shapiro gets his wings 
Feminism,1615713751,No I just want you to tell me how those two statements aren t equally abhorrent  You know if you can take time away from your empty self righteous posturing

Feminism,1615712995, gt so why can t you just done this one small thing to make them feel more comfortable  Jesus how many other  small changes do you want us to add to the already large pile of  small changes women have had to make for the fragile male ego Whether  all men or not are sexual assailants I m confident to say yes all men when it comes to this ridiculous entitlement 
Feminism,1615712908,I did read it It was full of completely unfounded and totally inaccurate slander  And nothing more 
Feminism,1615712767,Lovely  More ad hominems  How many hours have you volunteered rehabbing homes for transitional housing for victims of domestic abuse 
Feminism,1615712633,It s a difficult one though The overwhelming majority of men aren t doing stuff like this and to see all these posts generalising the actions of a few as the actions of all is not okay You wouldn t say not all Muslims are terrorists but a few are so we have to be careful of all of them  that s just racist   
Feminism,1615712442,Sounds like you re the one with the hurt feelings  You know nothing about me  Not a single one of your assumptions or accusations is even remotely true which is to say they d all be incredibly offensive if I were inclined to respond with an emotional tirade on par with yours Still nothing you said explains how those two statements aren t equally abhorrent 
Feminism,1615712401,But they prove to us time and time again that half the population   are  usually a threat 
Feminism,1615711701,Lmao who gave this douche an award for his smooth brain take 
Feminism,1615710723,Black people are given poorer medical care have fewer rights are killed because of their skin colour have a very recent history of being literal slaves and their votes are suppressed by white people Yesterday was the anniversary of Breonna Taylor s death a woman shot dead in her home by white police who faced no consequences Men get treated better Men have more privelage higher wages more expectations of equality more opportunities less  not non existent but less expectations of physical and sexual violence against them less blame or consequences for physical and sexual violence to name a few differences Look at the fact that you just threw out a victim card the second you weren t considered perfect and better based on your gender while a woman was trying to make a point Poor me I m not considered better than for five minutes I d better insert my opinion to prove I actually am better than while comparing myself to a marginalized group of people for the pain I felt at not being considered perfect and special during this exchange And before you go there I m a hispanic guy I m just done seeing  not all men try to detract from women s movements because it means men have to stop being special for five fucking minutes so yeah all men Men are trash I am trash because I have to be associated with people like you who can t see women asking for attention and help without pulling out the victim card and saying  b but my feelings are huwt on every post where a woman feels like a second class citizen because she s treated like one Next time your feelings are hurt instead of posting try stepping outside of yourself for five minutes to answer the question why someone might feel a certain way about something if you can t immediately see it Chances are it s because they re being treated in a way you can t and don t have to imagine because of the privelage of being not treated that way so trying to detract from that with weird dogwhistles or whattabouting isn t going to improve the situation for anyone and you re just making an ass of yourself and the rest of  all men  
Feminism,1615708539,If they were so mad maybe they should start getting mad at the rapists and misogynists instead of the women being raped and treated poorly for their choice in words and maybe that s the whole fucking problem  a former  not all men douchebag

Feminism,1615706373,If you aren t part of that  all men group then speak out and talk about the issues and crimes committed against women daily Excluding yourself from the problem will not make the problem go away  
Feminism,1615704985,And it bothers me when someone says  not all men since they are immediately pushing the attention away from the real issue just because they feel uncomfortable by a statement People seriously need to stop jumping to conclusions and think for a sec 
Feminism,1615704931,You brought a really good point because I get the impression that at least here in the West some people accept more easily this prejudice against Muslim which is abhorrent  I say this as a guy that also had a prejudice against Muslims and took some time to change myself   Returning to the topic I find the thinking of this topic kind of disturbing and even hopeless if you think that almost half of the world population is male and you perceive half of the world as a threat to your life you are doomed   This thinking is not only bad to the male but to the female too especially those who had traumatic experiences 
Feminism,1615704304,In that moment give her quite a bit of space Cross to the other side of the road if you like make it clear with your body language and gait that you re just a person trying to get from point A to point B and have zero interest in her  But if you want to help women feel safe you can also try to make the world a safer place Copying an older comment of mine    gt You can educate yourself I d start with the book Sexual Citizens    gt    gt You can get involved in local politics and advocate for more effective legal frameworks to fight abuse and assault    gt    gt You can donate and volunteer for nonprofits that provide resources for battered women    gt    gt You can call out sexist beliefs and behaviors in your friends and family    gt    gt You can as an everyday practice  be aware of how you might be impacting women      gt    gt You can teach your children especially boys about how to be effective allies    gt    gt These are all starting points for ongoing efforts It isn t something you can do for a day or a week and then declare victory Learn give and lift as you are able    gt    gt  Here s a discussion   on another subreddit that I think you will find informative 
Feminism,1615703625,Yes when you advocate for that kind of thinking you indirectly make it acceptable in other situations too Now progressive people will say that it s not the same when it s applied to a minority or oppressed group and rightfully so But the thing is we don t all agree who s the victim and who s the oppressor Both TERF and the superstraight nuts think they are oppressed by trans people Fascist believe jews are the oppressors and immigrants are invaders and so on If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor Surely no fash believe all jews control the media or whatever 
Feminism,1615703029,Yeah its a bit of a sticky situation because I know the intentions of it but it still hurts I am a muslim and it is as if someone would replace the word men with Muslim and with the controversy of hijab and burka ban s going around in Europe it just does not make sense to me Its so discriminatory
Feminism,1615702971,The language is illustrative that the generalization is already happening Rape and harassment is just that common of an experience that we first prepare ourselves for the worst It s normal if it makes you uncomfortable If you are ever walking in a dark street and there s a single woman she WILL be aware and take precaution  cross the street have her keys ready so she can drive off etc   If you invite a woman over to your house for the first time she WILL tell her friends your name  amp address just in case Her father and brothers WILL be worried when she starts dating you It s nothing against you I m sure you re a nice person but until she gets to know you there s a real risk for her 
Feminism,1615702479,Let me try to you all think about this point by just changing the subjects   Most of the crimes here are committed by black people I was robbed several times not even one of them were white or Asian or another thing then black and I m even black too my direct ancestry were slaves and indigenous   So I could say I don t know which blacks are criminals or no if I m walking alone and see a black male I ll presume that he is a criminal and take care       No its not all blacks But we don t know which one       One black man with the wrong intentions is enough men to be afraid Well put         I don t agree with this and I don t find this thinking fair I prefer to presume that all blacks are innocent and decent men just like me until they prove contrary

Feminism,1615698260, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action     
Feminism,1615697691,If you want to compare this to the race situation the true analog to the criticism of men would be the criticism of white people not of black people At least there people are starting to realize that we re talking about white people as a monolith and not every individual white person so we don t have hashtags like  NotAllWhitePeople floating around 
Feminism,1615695174,Women  We are fearful of men and with good reason  You  Well that s just hurtful What about men   
Feminism,1615694434,No because the proportion of men versus women who are rapists is much higher      percent  And rape is way more common than murder Most of us know a rape victim 
Feminism,1615693890,This problem can so easily be solved just by using a qualifier Say  some  or  too many  Anything It s literally that simple You know by this point that a lot of men  notice the qualifier take issue with being overgeneralised as rapists and misogynists so why can t you just done this one small thing to make them feel more comfortable 
Feminism,1615691013,Ive said this before didnt know she said it too Thats cool great actor too
Feminism,1615689484,Don t spread bullshit that s not true If you re sexist just say it 
Feminism,1615689219,Men are not saying that she should have been careful from my point of view From what i ve seen it s men getting told that they are the problem which is generalising and doesnt help the situation
Feminism,1615688654,I do believe it s all men All male humans are socially conditioned  whether they realize it or not to be ignorant of women s minority position in society and their passive or aggressive complicity to th issue 
Feminism,1615687276,basically the same thing as saying that all black people are killers because      of americans are black and      of americans who got arrested for murder in     were black  which makes it statistically  x as likely to kill someone if you re black 
Feminism,1615686021,A downvote No explanation or comments You are up your own asshole 
Feminism,1615684891,Because other  groups of people are much closer together  groups  meanwhile the   sexes group that accounts for nearly     of the humans on earth also seems to have the biggest difference between groups Testosterone and Estrogen create much much more differences in people than Italian and Chinese blood could ever  So naturally people are gonna lump them together until the day they die Doesn t mean all of the criticisms found by lumping people together just because they are M or F is bad But stopping there without understanding the full context of a human being and simply saying  boys are bad because they re men will always be circular and invalid logic 
Feminism,1615682314,You are the problem Far too fragile and far too prone to digging your own grave 
Feminism,1615740158,As a straight white male ally Atleast in the southern states I can say men do not hold men accountable That s personal experience but I stand by that statement

Feminism,1615737801,Nobody is blaming men as a collective here  I am a man if you think this is post is calling you out it s because you re part of the problem 
Feminism,1615736738,I m gonna go ahead and say the intervention part isn t true I had a friend who casually told me a story about how he basically sexually harassed a girl and when he was called out on it his only response was the get mad and defensive I m gonna go out on a limb and say most of the guys with these tendencies towards women will not react well when called out even by men This isn t to say it isn t men s jobs to call out toxic behavior just wondering how we can realistically correct it if the people perpetrating it don t want to hear it

Feminism,1615733456, gt then why aren t all men helping women in ways that would lessen the violence women face That s my point The OP and many others like you demand that literally every single man act in a certain way That s absurd There are many ways to effect change and support without following your demands  gt Misandry does not even exist Yikes  gt I just know you re racist in the way you refer to black people as  blacks as well as stereotyping Muslims as terrorists Honestly I can see why you would say this because it does feel a little rough coming off the tongue But the verbiage has been very fluid over the recent years and there really isn t an accepted term yet People of color colored people black people blacks African American etc all offend someone for some reason Know that I acknowledge that but saying I m a racist because of that is a way to try and dehumanize me so you don t have to address my argument or simply ignore it as invalid The Muslim thing was also part of the point I m making Reading comprehension will tell you that I don t believe Muslims are terrorists The statement is terrible and very bigoted However I simply crafted it using the exact language of the original post to make a point This tweet OP basically says  all men are the problem in some way  How would that read about blacks whites Muslims women etc  etc 
Feminism,1615733421,It s  very counter productive to blame men as a collective Most intelligent decent people will not tolerate harassment

Feminism,1615726524,They don t exclude portrayal of gender roles but Kelly Reinhardt s films usually subtextually comment on them especially in Meeks Cutoff and Certain Women 
Feminism,1615726495,Hmmm   Replace the term  Men with other religion ethnicity race etc etc And it comes off as being discriminatory as fuck 
Feminism,1615726293,I think a big part of the problem is that the men who treat women like shit often group together and validate their behaviour within those groups I can t honestly say there are any guys I know who are or have been shitty to women  to my knowledge  And that s another part of the problem I don t know how my friends treat women when I m not around It s hard to call someone out on something if I have no idea what s going Best I can do is lead by example whenever there s an opportunity to do more than be passive and hope it s well received 
Feminism,1615725872,As a man with narcissistic tendencies myself who hopefully didn t cause any trauma or anguish but certainly was unstable in past relationships it s very common for me to want to publicly display somehow that I m  reformed and think people will see that and fully change their mind about me I personally have stopped myself every time and realized the moment I do that will be a complete disgrace to the movement and everything I ve learned from it  I have absolutely  sympathy for myself and others like this I just imagine this sort of thing is really common Just another opportunity for men to take over what belongs to women and expect credit and praise while not having to deal with the stakes of it 
Feminism,1615725746,If everyone actually did what they could this would no longer be a problem Maybe you do but maybe someone else dont
Feminism,1615725672,Another redirect See This is the actual problem She raises a question and you go WHAT ABOUT THE WOMEN Taking away yet again focus It s just another way to say  not all men 
Feminism,1615725561,That s the thing the day the men says enough to the abusers it will stop right away If your friend acts badly towards a woman at work and you tell him they buddy I don t accept that kind of behaviour He will literally never do it again the shame to lose face in front of another man But as long as the abusers friends look the other way or even laugh it s consent enough to even make him escalate his behaviour It s obviously not enough with women saying stop 
Feminism,1615725475,I agree still you have to consider that all this information is not reaching the people it is supposed to reach Some random teen encounters part of it gets into a twitter argument with a few trolls and then starts to think that feminism is about hating all men A possible ally is turned into a misinformed bystander and people on the fence are driven towards misogyny 
Feminism,1615725118,Hmm we do what we can to make it safe for the people  we care Unfortunately we can t stand up for everyone 
Feminism,1615724929,Oh have you decided to pretend you were joking because your insistence that your volunteer work makes you more knowledgeable about abuses committed against women than women themselves wasn t working Get the heck out of r Feminism You clearly are not a feminist 
Feminism,1615724699,Valid point but do all women do that too I can promise to you that I m more worried about the effect my mother will have on my niece than my brother
Feminism,1615723881,Sadly I think the answer is no not all men do stand up for women It s one thing to say you believe in equality and fair treatment and another thing entirely to call out your closest friends and family on harmful behaviour Personally I don t know of any other guys in my life who have actively stood up for women myself included if I m being honest 
Feminism,1615723815,I should be able to express whatever I want about my trauma publicly without being bullied and re traumatized If you don t support women healing in the ways they choose to I suggest you leave this group 
Feminism,1615723103,How many women have you through your own actions helped escape abuse  I can honestly say the number for me is in the hundreds  Yet you call me a garbage human being because I m offend by an overtly sexist comment  What the fuck is wrong with you  Go do something for some one else you worthless self important piece of shit 
Feminism,1615722678,Honestly you sound like a clown and have nothing but bad takes I ll fuck myself with whatever I d like and your shit brand of shock  humor is about as edgy as a sphere people have been using it since they invented language 
Feminism,1615722220,Yes abusive men are a problem  So is assuming all men are abusive  It was a crass utterly tasteless joke made out of frustration  Sue me 
Feminism,1615721827, the actual victims of abuse I ve worked with have acquired a pretty keen sense of  which men   If true then what you re saying is   women need to just sense which men are bad but also that women who do have this sense are not saved from abuse anyway With that solution being flawed shouldn t you agree that abusive men are the problem not women wary of abusive men 
Feminism,1615721422,Honestly you wouldn t be able to pass any screening I know of to be anywhere near victims of abuse  I m pretty sure the only one pretending here is you  Take your fake outrage and tie it inro a cute bun then fuck yourself with it 
Feminism,1615721176,Yep  It s a sad dynamic and it was a crass joke 
Feminism,1615720969,What the fuck are you talking about I never not one fucking time said anything about any of my feelings let alone the one you just invented  Nowhere do I say anything about feeling like I ve been treated poorly  What an absolute shit show of projection to cap off your entire thread of bullshit you made up and attribute to me I m sorry but I m done with you  If you really want to know my  story there s eleven years of my post history for you to peruse  Go back far enough and you ll find your  whattaboutism   And if when you get there kindly go fuck yourself preferably with one of those hoses you re seem fixated on 
Feminism,1615720427, gt Judging by the number of repeat clients it would seem  which is their type  This is pretty well researched in the field of psychology It s an aspect of trauma bonding a person within a traumatic relationship   abusive harassing sexual violence anything like that   will sometimes become dependent on the person abusing them Which can happen for however many reasons often gaslighting or simply not having a way out   it s safer to become dependent than to completely isolate yourself and to put yourself into a potentially more dangerous situation by leaving You can just google trauma bond if you want it explained in better terms Once the victim of this leaves the relationship however they ll often get into relationships with other abusive people Not because that s their  type   which is just a sickening thing to say honestly nobody goes out of their way to find abusive partners   but because the traits extant on their previous abusive partner that they  fell in love with will also be extant on new potential partners The trauma bond doesn t magically go away when you leave a relationship and if you became bonded to a person who was emotionally negligent and ignored your interests then its easy to become attached to another person who is also emotionally negligent because that s simply what love looks like in your traumatised experience It s also that abuse can decimate your self esteem So you leave one abusive relationship but can often feel like you deserved the abuse or at least don t deserve true love so you re willing to put up with other abusive relationships because at least then you re not alone with your own poor mental state

Feminism,1615756726,It s incredible how fast the conversation was diverted into  not everyone is like that  just like in BLM Everyone needs to understand that this is a global cultural matter It is not a question if   you  or someone you knew have abused women harassed women beat women killed women or cat called women This is a behaviour that young girls had to learn to protected themselves from The whole  boys will be boys kind of comment come to mind in which people just passively allow this behaviour to happen If you think this is not okay and want to do something about it then be vocal about this with your peers be an advocate start the conversation discuss it in depth bring it up and say that for you this is not okay This is not a woman s issue it s a man s issue 
Feminism,1615756555,I really like this It s long past time we raise the bar for what it means to be a good man It reminds me of  There are two kinds of evil people in this world People who do evil stuff and people who see evil stuff being done and don t try to stop it

Feminism,1615753850,Curious about your hashtag of   to many woman  Is it short for  annoying to many woman or  a pest to many woman  or perhaps  unsurprising reflexive misogyny directed to many woman  Actually that was a rubbish guess This game is fun 
Feminism,1615753759,Same argument with  not all cops are bad  I think of that particularly after seeing the news about the Met police roughing up the crowd that was there for Sarah Everard s vigil the other night 
Feminism,1615753746,I like the idea behind the analogy but I feel it falls flat because the only real relationship we have with ticks is that they carry Lyme disease while men women relationships are very very complex and it can be alienating to suggest men don t care and or aren t doing anything about women s issues  I think what you mean to say is something like  not enough men  meaning not enough men are calling out abusers rapists etc because it doesn t affect them as much as it affects women This is a message I think  practically all men can get behind The disconnect comes from the fact that men as a whole need to do more but men as individuals feel absolutely powerless to change anything and it s demoralizing to treat men like they don t care on the whole 
Feminism,1615753146,The Bro Code by Barney Stinson a very interesting and useful book
Feminism,1615752923,Since you only care about single statistic     U S Census Bureau which revealed that in      a study of a percentage women and men who admitted to forcing sex found that     per cent of that subset were women compared to     per cent of men     college study of    men and boys which found that   had been sexually coerced into unwanted intercourse with   per cent of the perpetrators reported as being female    toManyWoman
Feminism,1615752184,No because its not my responsibility nor obligation to deal with the malicious behavior of those who  happen to be the same sex as I Are all women  required to stop other women s bad behavior I certainly don t expect them to because they re not affiliated with every other woman on the planet The same goes for men

Feminism,1615747797,This this this Generally I fear men far more than I feel protected by them without a doubt They ve collectively traumatized us    
Feminism,1615746719,I don t personally think this is a man vs woman thing For instance I doubt many women have step up for a man when they see their wife belittling them in public Or that many daughters have discussions with their parents about the importance of men s emotional mental well being But that doesn t make all women coabusers  What s going on is called the bystander effect When you are taught cpr you are told that you can t just say  call     to a crowd No one will act You need to say  hey you in the white shirt call      The key is to transform it into a personal responsibility issue Otherwise people of both genders will just stand idly by and watch  So in general we need to create a better society with more empathy and personal responsibility We need to create people who will stand up and act against injustice when they see it whether it be related to sexism racism income inequality etc And we need both men and women doing that if we want things to change It s so so hard as people are wired to be risk adverse and not sacrifice themselves for others So rather than blast people for not standing up we should frame it in a way where we praise the people who do People like to be praised and get defensive in the face of criticism So I think with these types of issues you go with the carrot rather than the stick
Feminism,1615746338,I understand that sexism against women tends to happen more often than against men however if you are really looking for true equality surely you should still be asking the same question about women when there is sexism against men Both are a problem  Would just like to add though that I do still believe every point here is valid however it is unnecessarily targeted at one gender and I hope I don t have to point out that that is the sexism you claim to be against

admittedly the lack of used to be a huge problem within feminism and still is in large parts  It also doesn t bring up anything about how feminism has progressed the discussion about gender in academia something which I suspect is very undervalued In other words it focuses on specifically men s issues that are not related to sexuality race etc The intention is not to say feminism is equally about men as it is for women it does certainly focus on women and is completely fine doing so but the point is that the larger majority of the movement do care and that there is an expanding space within feminism that can and do talk about it Solving men s issues help women and vice versa  though my personal opinion is that it s most effective to do both  The goal is to give feminists an easy

Feminism,1615776292,This is something I have been trying to do   Honestly I catch myself mostly   It just reminds me that it takes continual effort to change 
Feminism,1615776061,Yup I get really pissed when I see an insta post that s like  girls guys   insert stereotype  like holy shit what s so hard about putting  some before it What s so hard about not generalizing
Feminism,1615775871,Yes and I feel as if over generalizing of people  amp groups is the cause of a lot of mis understood issues nowadays 
Feminism,1615775771,Exactly Said it on another post but gonna say it again because these posts keep popping up Not all men is used as a derailing tactic They know what they re doing The more you spell it out for them in posts like these the better their strategy is working We are teaching and wasting energy engaging with dumb arguments rather than actually discussing more pertinent issues Stop humouring them and let s get back to having actual fruitful discourse in the FEMINISM subreddit 
Feminism,1615775719, gt And who are responsible for constantly perpetuating those stereotypes Everyone is responsible not just men Come on this is basic feminist theory that you re getting wrong
Feminism,1615775440,That is a good point I think the problem with the post is it is singling out physical harm instead of just power in general Expanding it to power makes a better point but the tick analogy doesn t cover it very well then It s also is a bit too much of a blanket statement  But it s enough to keep us in a constant state of fear  This is saying that all women are always in fear because of the potential of physical harm from men  I guess the question is who is the target audience If it s meant to show people who don t understand what you explained it doesn t do a very good job You however summed up what it should have said very succinctly I think it s very easy to say men have many different types of power over women and almost all men have abused that power even if only minimally It s much more relatable and less polarizing Anyway I m new here and if I ve come off as ignorant please let me know I m here to try and be less ignorant 
Feminism,1615774979,I don t like generalization I see through the intentions of those people who rush to say  not all men to downplay women s problems But when a person says something bad and adds  all men to it then I really think that s wrong Isn t the point to just get rid of generalization entirely 
Feminism,1615774929,I think when people say  not all men they re trying to call out the fact that some people think  all men are fucking idiots and  all men can go die in a hole  Nobodies saying women should just stop worrying when they go outside in the dark and worry about being sexually assaulted

Feminism,1615771680,I wish some of them had juuust this much self control
Feminism,1615770462,I just wanted to come here and say that men are not monsters we are humans U guys have created this narrative that men do all the wrong and women are absolutely blameless for their actions While  women dies at the hands of a bad person does not mean all men are responsible for his actions Young men die everyday and as a young man u have a higher chance of dying in the street then women We are not monster stop trying to demonize masculinity Its  women who died why don t we bring up all the wives that kill their husband s and get away wit it 
Feminism,1615770178,It s true that  notallwomen falsely accused men But do all women work to make sure their fellow women do not falsely accuse men Do they interrupt troubling language and behaviour in others Do they have conversations about mens safety consent with their daughters Are  allwomen interested in our safety 
Feminism,1615769706,The difference is about power dynamics and what the agenda is  When it comes to violence against females the group with less power is developing safety strategy based on frequent experiences so they don t continue to be harassed by those in power  The agenda is equality  In the case of refugees the group with more power is bullying the group with less power using isolated incidences as examples The agenda is political power  perhaps sprinkled with white supremacy  Essentially those in power should not abuse their power As a corollary it s vitally important we all recognize where we as individuals are in power and where we aren t A same person can be in different categories for different issues  eg a male refugee is in power as a male and not in power as a refugee We should help him out as a refugee but call him out if he mistreats his wife  
Feminism,1615768995,All people have a duty to work for the betterment and safety of others 
Feminism,1615768959,I think it would make a difference if we started to really acknowledge the mental health and substance abuse issues that contribute heavily to violence against women 
Feminism,1615768817,I mean I m sure there are men I would consider or at some point have considered friends who do those things but they don t do any of that around me I mean I m not really a man but most people only know me as one so maybe it s different for others but I think a lot of times men who do say and do this shit know who among their friends they can get away with being open about that with 
Feminism,1615768758,Kinda late out here but look up the Polgar sisters They re kind of like real versions of Beth Harmon women who made it to the highest echelons of competitive chess 
Feminism,1615767957,Cap I m not a baby sitter not responsible for the shitty behavior of others  Or can an individual woman really not take care of themself    I swear none of you are actual feminists
Feminism,1615767435,Yeah not all men are abusers but enough are that its a problem
Feminism,1615766185, gt He will literally never do it again That s incorrect Is this anecdotal or just something you assume would happen if a guy was called out because that has NOT been my partners  m experience    When he s called guys out for bad behaviour he s been met with denial anger brushed off and laughed at ignored and very commonly gets ganged up on by other guys in the group who also feel attacked because they do say the same shit Any other time he gets along with these same guys really well just not when he s calling them out   My partner sells cars and deals with a lot of sexism and monogyny among the salesmen and mechanics An example of behaviour    Woman comes in to deal with the company for whatever reason mechanics get all excited and start elbowing each other encouraging each guy to try get a look even if it s to go into an area they normally aren t in talk about what they d do to her partner hears it and tells them their behaviour is gross and desperate they laugh and tell him to basically F off he s just emotional white knight SJW etc    Second example Partner was out of town for training along with another dude when they go out for dinner before returning their hotel Not long after partner learns this dude has a GF he sees him on Tinder trying to hook up with multiple girls for the ONE night they re staying there Partner calls him out gently saying  that s messed up     it s been a year and half now and this dude hates his guts still and tries to mess with him   Last example His friends he grew up with used the word  gay to express annoyance disgust boredom etc He decides to call his friend out on it one day friend thinks it s a joke and not serious keeps doing it multiple times until he realised partner is serious sort of stopped doing it for a while before going back to it because he  has gay friends who said it s ok so it s ok  Didn t have much to say when my partner responded back that both him and I are bi and my brother is trans and we re actually not ok with it It s toned down now but it hasn t  literally ever happened again like you want to believe    I m not attacking you or your ideal situation because how freaking great would it be if men DID just need one talking to by their mates before they changed their behaviour Sadly that s not realistic though It takes people a while to accept they might be wrong about their long term behaviour and longer to rewire the brain  especially the older the person is  I mean would you instantly change when    people never had an issue with your behaviour over   years but now one random friend is saying you re not actually the nice upstanding person everyone else said you were 
Feminism,1615765312,That s just blatantly wrong Nobody should be assaulted in anyway and yes women are victims dramatically more often but this type of comment does nothing to change anything    
Feminism,1615764330,I read it it s indeed a cohesive study But the solution in the conclusion doesn t put the blame on the idea of  false perception of female innocence but the fact that gender stereotypes put many of those men in positions where they are unable to identify their own abuse And who are responsible for constantly perpetuating those stereotypes     Gasp   Men did you shot yourselves in the foot and now you want to blame a statistic on women even when your own article concludes the problem is a male made issue unless you want to argue that somehow women were able to perpetuate those stereotypes 
Feminism,1615764053,Uhhh   because we don t care for being harassed assaulted raped murdered etc I know women am I right   
Feminism,1615763947,Plus  speak to your sons Make them a better ally and they ll be stronger men and happier people It s not a zero sum game 
Feminism,1615763844,My book What English grammar   I think you re trying to troll feminism but realising that grammar pedants are a far greater threat  Feminism is cool tho 
Feminism,1615762194,I have a question so why do I always here women being scared of men when it s dark in the streets
Feminism,1615760803,standing up for women didn t stop me getting raped by one I don t understand these rhetorical statements of course not all men are interested in this as not all women are interested in treating other women or men as equal shitty people exist everywhere and it doesn t matter what gender they are 
Feminism,1615760616,says the person who cannot find any counter argument to change my mind of course I have other thing to do than speak with ppl that disagree with me but cannot find anything to change my mind good luck finding gender equality with such methods cause if you can t explain me how I m wrong when I m all ears of course I won t agree with you
Feminism,1615760040,Yes it is absolutely your responsibility to call out sexist comments and jokes towards women not doing anything about it leads to desentisization of sexual assault and rape therefore less likely to take sexual assault and rape seriously which is why women talk about their greviances men don t believe them In the UK    of young women      years old have sexual harassment it s not women s job to fix this it s a problem with men and it is our responsibility to flattern that percentage not taking reponsibility as you said makes you part of the problem
Feminism,1615759940,You re only showing your ignorance Since you re so insulted I m sure you will find something else to do 
Feminism,1615759843,says the person who is straight up insulting me  and no it was not useless I m showing my disagreement based on facts hoping people would be a little bit open minded but I guess insulting strangers is waaaaayyyy more useful
Feminism,1615759691,This is a really good start u LapisRS I wish more men would simply   ask  the way you re doing    You might also listen to the women around you when they complain about things men say or do Or ask those women about it giving them a safe space and making no comments when they answer you There are obvious things that men say and do that range from inappropriate to harmful but there are also things that may seem innocent but make a solid percentage of women feel uncomfortable or unsafe For example a while back I complained to an otherwise pretty forward thinking male friend about how hard it was to find a boyfriend to which he replied that maybe if I smiled more and let strangers approach me I d have a boyfriend Stuff like that 
Feminism,1615759428,And as a woman I can believe that because most men that I ve encountered have been very respectful to me 
Feminism,1615758532,  If you read and understood the comments you would know not to say something so monumentally useless 
Feminism,1615758500,Ok but men don t owe you protection Thats it thats why Do you jump to protect men No you don t 
Feminism,1615758351,ok so you re making the assumption that all men do these things and that s not true  I am an exemple at least no I read only the comments not the responses so I had a global idea of what feminists wanted to say and how they are thinking
Feminism,1615757346,or maybe you didn t find the right partner we all got our ways and there is probably one person there that like the same thing as you
Feminism,1615757343,Probably an unpopular opinion that will kill my karma but I m not sure that all men having a duty to be the protectors of women is feminism This reads more like   th century coverture 
Feminism,1615757265,the username is a pure joke don t use it as an argument and don t think you re smart cause you pointed it out  i m not saying you are 
Feminism,1615757126,Congratulations You ve never had to deal with the men you know in private when they re horny  I m sure you re scrolling backwards through r feminism to be super helpful 
Feminism,1615756956,as a man who was raised among men I can tell you that nobody says that I never heard that in whole my life
Feminism,1615756873,U S Census Bureau which revealed that in      a study of a percentage women and men who admitted to forcing sex found that     per cent of that subset were women compared to     per cent of men     college study of    men and boys which found that   had been sexually coerced into unwanted intercourse with   per cent of the perpetrators reported as being female   toManyWoman
Feminism,1615782474,So you re really saying that women just don t uphold gender roles Ok where does this wild theory come from

Feminism,1615781583,Hey I really think you would enjoy r penophobiaawareness subreddit We are taking a stand against descrimination and hate against women  
Feminism,1615781201,I wonder if we re due for this kind of discussion to remind us all why stereotypes are immoral and undesirable We all grew up being told not to stereotype whole groups based on individuals that prejudice is bad but a lot of us probably haven t spent much time weighing the pros and cons because it is just seen as an obviously awful thing to do full stop Then enough time goes by that someone can openly advocate the textbook definition of prejudice and there are some people who go  yeah you know what stereotypes are actually pretty useful I wonder why we ever stopped using them People are like ticks if enough are bad then it s ok to act as though they re all that way makes perfect sense  
Feminism,1615781167,Black people commit a disproportionate amount of violent crime in the US By the logic of OP s info graphic it would be fair to said  black people are criminals and when called out on it retreat to  well no no no I don t mean  all black people I m just using general language to point out a trend  It s ridiculous Generalizations are harmful We shouldn t make them about men or blacks people or Syrian refugees

Feminism,1615780465, gt This is true though Whenever I am walking in the dark I  am always in a constant state of fear Even it s not dark and I need to walk past a group of men who are loitering there is a baseline fear always  My smart watch will show a sudden increase in heart rate  Ya I see what you mean there It s an odd dichotomy that men can both make women feel safe and also fear just by being present I was picturing walking with my wife This would make her feel more safe However I m sure she would still have some fear walking past a group of men even if I were with her Depending on the situation of course Plenty of food for thought there Idk I guess it was hard for me to identify with the core of what the post meant And then I see comments like some in this thread basically saying that if someone doesn t get it now they never will Well I didn t get it and you helped me understand I know there are people who fight against this and  not all men is a tactic I feel like at a glance it s a damn good tactic for someone who doesn t want to understand Someone who doesn t want to examine themselves gets a free pass because they aren t violent Now if they re not guilty why get introspective Anyway what I m trying to say is thanks for not being dismissive and taking the time to articulate the subject 
Feminism,1615780403,This argument would also work really well to support a lot of really heinous forms of bigotry like anti semitism as acceptable because  in the eyes of the anti Semite the Jews are the party in power and have the control Or poor white people and affirmative action or men going through family court Just because a group thinks they have less power than another group in a particular instance does not make stereotypes and sexism morally acceptable 
Feminism,1615780175,I just don t think so I owe no duty to you unless we enter into privity Also the post was sex specific It assumes either that women need men s protection or that men have a duty to women or both As a woman I don t need a man to take care of me As a feminist I believe in individualism and empowerment via personal responsibility 
Feminism,1615779407,If I did the same thing with the male reproductive organs this whole subreddit would go ape shit
Feminism,1615779365, when  in   women are only out for the money and the other  do nothing they all are out for the money  Wrong quote  Changed men women Changed shit money How is that quote even a aurgment I used the same aurgment with different nouns and verbs It could apply to so many different things and more clear as to why it as a aurgment basis Doesn t make sense So all drinkers are responsible for all drunk driving deaths  No it s only drinkers are responsible for drunk driving  The whole party isn t responsible for the lesser  of fucked up individuals 
Feminism,1615778730,Good idea for a comic and I agree in principle but this is cringe tbh As feminists we really need more affective talking points than complaining abt teenage boys who say  not all men  It s a fine talking point in spaces primarily for women but it s bringing no men over to our side unfortunately Talking about the  in  women and  in  men and other rape statistics I think is a much better way to converse about rape culture We  need better consent education regardless of assigned gender 
Feminism,1615777906,Oh absolutely I used men in my example because I see them get defensive more but you re right in that it occurs from both sexes quite frequently
Feminism,1615777830,Yeah i guess I was also talking about girls too I don t like it when anyone stereotypes generalizes either gender
Feminism,1615777690,Couldn t agree more Most of these arguments can be avoided by just saying   some men do  x  instead of  men do  x   Imagine actually being able to discuss a problematic behavior with someone because they don t feel personally attacked or accused    That being said the  some is often implied and simply not picked up on 
Feminism,1615777524,Yep this Exactly this See also  a few bad apples instead of understanding the huge underlying systemic issue and way too much injustice 
Feminism,1615777200,It s also similar to racist talking points  Replace the  men with any other group and it s really obvious 
Feminism,1615776949,All analogies are just proxies of the actual issues and they often remove the context My point was that comparing  different analogies doesn t always make sense because the context can be very different  ie power dynamics  I agree that for the same issue you may need different analogies to get the point across to different people In this graphic I am interpreting tick bites as an analogy for  all types of harm  physical  amp mental as verbal abuse is still abuse   gt This is saying that all women are always in fear because of the potential of physical harm from men This is true though Whenever I am walking in the dark I  am always in a constant state of fear Even it s not dark and I need to walk past a group of men who are loitering there is a baseline fear always  My smart watch will show a sudden increase in heart rate  
Feminism,1615797935,I think this thread sums it up Stereotypes and prejudice apology is the right wing approach The left wing one is that it s not men as individuals who are the target of criticism but social structures 
Feminism,1615797646,Some issues are very much gendered though and sexual violence is definitely one of them So yes everyone needs better education but this could be interpreted in a genderblind kind of way which would be a mistake  not that I think that s what you meant by this 
Feminism,1615797641,Someone called this sexist and the comment as well  Takes all sorts  
Feminism,1615796812,as I explained in a similar  thread    gt Now  progressive people will say that it s not the same when it s applied to  a minority or oppressed group and rightfully so But the thing is we  don t all agree who s the victim and who s the oppressor Both TERF and  the superstraight nuts think they are oppressed by trans people Fascist  believe jews are the oppressors and immigrants are invaders and so on  If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not  just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor Surely no fash  believe all jews control the media or whatever 
Feminism,1615795220,Aside from a few factual corrections  as far as I m aware men are punished more severely for all types of crime and are more at risk for violent crime although I could be wrong  I m curious as to why the distinction of privilege is significant in this case I acknowledge readily that racial minorities have been and are oppressed by white people as a class I acknowledge that women are oppressed by men as a class in some respects although unlike with race this relationship is much more fuzzy Nonetheless if I am determining whether or not to cross the street when I see someone of a certain racial or gendered characteristic coming why does it matter if the class the trait belongs to is the oppressive or oppressed group 
Feminism,1615794977,So would it be justified for me to distrust all poor looking people or racial minorities because similar statistics exist for their perpetration of crime or not Is it acceptable to judge individual people based on data about their social class if the price of trust is your own safety  I m asking this in good faith this isn t a  gotcha moment or anything 
Feminism,1615794745,I completely agree with this pic but man it s gonna be weird being a cop and still holding these opinions 
Feminism,1615794226,Ticks don t have feelings though Being innocent with to ill intention but being treated as such is unfair It s like saying all humans are murderers because some are 
Feminism,1615794063,Not the same thing  Cops are supposed to stop such things  If I see someone catcalling or discriminating a woman most of the time the best I can do I is voice my opinion Cops have the authority to stop other cops from doing illegal things 
Feminism,1615793897,No With  all men it s  too many men  With  all cops it s quite literally every single last cop because that s what the job is 
Feminism,1615792517,Except it is all cops The ones who do their job properly and follow the rules are still doing something immoral They re using violence to uphold an unjust social order on the behalf of the rich and powerful Even the nicest neighborhood beat cop is doing that
Feminism,1615792188,As a man I ve been bullied by other men for defending women in certain situations I honestly don t even wanna bring up some of the situation because they re extremely triggering  both for me and also women here but all I can say is be mindful of the way men treat women be mindful of how women feel in the moment and be mindful of the dangerous realities that women face every day 
Feminism,1615792106,I m so glad those pieces of shit conservatives got kicked out in WA Biggest loss in history apparently Now we need to get them out of the government and make them obsolete Can t believe people have been supporting rape enablers for this long When will people learn conservatives do not care 
Feminism,1615792105,People have different life experiences Remember that before you judge somebody
Feminism,1615792072,Listen to her point of view Understand where she s coming from I m a conservative and my best friend is really liberal and we are like brothers 
Feminism,1615791806,Comparing men to ticks is not a good way to win over people  The best way to refute  not all men is to point out that feminists aren t saying  all men are bad in the first place it s the men who are trying to discredit them by unfairly generalizing and trying to turn this into a purity test  bad men vs innocent good men  Feminists say that some men are actively bad many more are disengaged and unhelpful often going along with the bad guys and that more broadly there are broader forces like masculinity and gender roles which can t be discussed in terms of individual guilt and innocence 
Feminism,1615791507,   Damn you both have some great perspective here I couldn t agree more with everything you guys have said and I support women who think this but just because I saw this brought up somewhere else I thought I d help clear it up here    I should preface that I hate the argument that I m about to talk about its based on racist ignorance and doesnt take into effect the context of America s negative history    People  not just women have been trying to find a parallel to this point by arguing that they should similarly be more afraid of black men because they are more likely to commit crime in their area The difference between the arguments is the context that Black people have disproportionately been forced in poorer neighborhoods and been oppressed in the workforce Essentially the crime comes from living in poverty not being black  e g  a third variable  The context as you said seems to play a particularly large role in understanding these types of social points and the variables that cause the social distress Do you have any thoughts on this I would love to hear anyone s perspective on how this point is isn t relatable to the point about men because I ve been arguing with racist family on Facebook about this these last few days I sure could use more help because their sexism and racism is extremely stubborn and frustrating     A follow up point the argument used against men  may be most applicable for anyone scared to walk down the street in an impoverished area at night As a Brazilian American I always avoid going to certain areas of my city in Brazil because they have more crime These areas just happen to be the poorest areas I by no means hate poor people though similarly to how the argument against men doesn t mean that women hate all men There s just strong information that informs our actions to be careful in these social situations    Even though the point above and the point about women fearing men seems fundamentally the same there is a huge difference again it s context The situation with poverty can be changed much faster than the situation with men this is because of how the situation with poverty has been constructed differently If the government just heavily funds these poorer communities we can simply eradicate these criminal differences without the need for more policing which leads to more unnecessary death I don t give a shit if people think my idea is socialist BS  most Brazilian family hate me for thinking this way  they can suck my socialist butt The situation with men cannot be fixed that easily I hope that all made sense I m tired af writing two   page neuroscience research papers studying for exams and barely getting by financially Life honestly makes me so depressed and exhausted but you all make me feel more confident that we re moving in the right direction 
Feminism,1615790956,Excuse mine and his spelling errors  in the post of mean Off not of And On the first photo I meant And not as 
Feminism,1615790789,listen and always be ready to attack when needed fellow white knight
Feminism,1615790637,Okay so the way I look at it is that rather than criticizing men focus criticism on male socialization behaviour So directing anger towards the systemic patriarchal structures that foster toxic male behaviour rather than the general male population That being said I want to clarify that when women make the decision to avoid be guarded around men it is not the same as prejudice Prejudice is hatred or discrimination based on affiliation with a  harmless group while being wary of men is based on the very real threat that they pose to women 
Feminism,1615790528,when people say  all cops and  all men they mean  too many cops and  too many men and some people will really never understand
Feminism,1615790299,Non AMP Link  here   I m a bot  Why      Code     Report issues  
Feminism,1615790287,I don t think it s a privelege to enter the Millitary on lower standards It s not an office job and it s not bloodless There is a perfectly fine debate to be had about how to integrate women into the Millitary and prepare them to become killing machines  geopolitical agents of dominance However much of the online buzz about this issue seems to be ego driven and is more about affirming men s traditional role as guard dogs than the actual efficacy of female soldiers in question There s been a recent move to make the US ACFT more gender neutral in its standards  here   is an article about that The only rational POV here  within a hawk context is to recruit the soldiers who are best able overall to cope with service duties and then funnel them into specific roles based on their abilities Beyond this there d be a serious values dissonance as it is not fair to endanger soldiers by letting them be ill prepared 
Feminism,1615790080,True Also lots of predators do this on purpose to get women to trust them or they do it b c they feel guilty about their own misogyny on some level 
Feminism,1615787712,Sexism cannot be defeated by an individual or personal responsibility If we do not work together we will get nowhere 
Feminism,1615787568,Uh when did this become a team sport  I m not responsible for dumbass over there and I m not going out of my way to get into other peoples business That sounds unreasonable  If I see or hear something I m directly a part of I d speak up I treat people with respect and if people around me do not align with my morals and it s severe enough I would cut them out I m not going to  convert them  I don t have time for that  This post is basically saying it s not good enough to be  one of the good guys  You have to also work endlessly until you achieved some unachievable goal of making every man in the world care And no just because some people don t care doesn t mean a lot of them don t Idk who you people interact with and the biggie how old you people are but this is a non issue in my circles  and it stays a non issue  This is a silly post and negative reenforcement doesn t work well What is the actual goal here 
Feminism,1615787139,The most powerful common act I ve seen men do to other men to keep them in check from abusing  amp threatening women is  the Look   I ve seen my son s and other men divert the mal intention of some men with the look that says  you ll have to move through me before I let you hurt her  If you aspire to be a  not all men man you ll have to challenge those  some men often with your eyes and be ready to back it up with the physical  I ve been around long enough to know that that is how the human race rolls  Do you have the buy in to fight for it

Feminism,1615784296, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action

Feminism,1615804720,This   This doesn t reference any particular group of people as being the source of the problem This was not an attack on men 
Feminism,1615803224,Gotta say if the feminist group wants more men then why not change the language from  men are rapists to  too many women are being raped  It s understood in both that it s mostly men who are raping women but the second one has a better chance of getting normal men to join the cause
Feminism,1615802737,Not sure if you read OP s question before it was but he specifically asked  how is this  it s not all men but we don t know which men different from saying not all black people but we don t know which black people  I provided examples on how it s not the same and how that felt like an obfuscation and a dogwhistle Comparing yourself to a maginalized and oppressed class when it s convenient to spin a narrative while ignoring the systematic injustices against said class versus the systematic advantages to another to smokescreen and counter an argument that men commit violent crimes against women and try to whattabout the argument into race baiting nonsense is really scummy to do on a board about women s issues and the amount of mental gymnastics required to say  you aren t allowed to talk about your safety or the danger men pose because it s akin to racism is absurd As to your point nobody is going to ask whether or not crossing the street to avoid a man is racist if that man is black versus white except for people fixated on that person s race so your scenario is a bit confusing Are you implying a woman who won t cross the street to avoid white men but will cross the street to avoid black men and women Yes that s racist  If a woman crosses the street to avoid a man regardless of race she s doing what society expects of her to  keep herself safe as it always comes back to when a woman is harmed  She should have been more aware of her surroundings she should have dressed differently she should have crossed the street when she saw someone approaching her she should have blah blah blah and other ways it s not the man s fault for harming her but her own fault for existing But then people want to say  not all men  despite it being a woman s fault for not suspecting it could be all men It s an absurd circular argument that could go round and round forever and everyone is tired of hearing it So to me and a lot of other people it s all men and that s not an issue of privelage or class it s a societal mandate issued by the government who refuses to prosecute men for their behaviors and teach women how to be afraid rather than teach men not to be abusers Women must keep themselves safe because the answer from policing and government agencies when they don t is  she should have suspected all men and acted in accordance with that

Feminism,1615801609,Having ones victimhood challenged because men feel embarrassed guilty seems more unfair No women or feminist are saying all men are murderers Like all metaphors it doesnt explore the whole picture  but it adequately explains the concept that male violence and the risk men pose to women can be real without it affecting all women and all men 
Feminism,1615800899,I think the analogy is really powerful At first I thought it was dehumanizing but on second thought I realized it really wasn t it wasn t blaming men or comparing men for ticks it was just explaining the mindset of women who suffered through interactions with toxic and predatory men BUT it s so hard to realize it sometimes I understand that it s not a real comparison but It s kind of triggering to think you re being compared to bugs given that dehumanizing campaigns around the world have compared other groups to insects

Feminism,1615838879,He really is this is literally his one flaw He has reasons with it though He s protective because past girlfriends have seriously hurt him and have done awful things to him He had a girlfriend who would rub it in his face that she would stay up late face timing other guys He has trust issues and believes more risqu clothes should be reserved for only intimate partners I agree partly but I also think people should wear whatever they want as long as it isn t straight up nudity

Feminism,1615838105,One thing you can do is share articles and studies about sexual violence and aggression on social media  be willing to put your face and name behind these issues and amplify women s voices  Be conscious of the language you use and that is used around you when talking about issues that disproportionately affect women Always be willing to learn Know when to shut it and listen Use your voice to amplify women s voices and call out harmful ones  When you consistently behave like an ally women will become more comfortable telling you about their experiences and you may end up learning some surprising things about men you always thought were decent Be prepared to learn those things and considerate of how you respond to what women tell you  Be willing to lose friends over their treatment of women

Feminism,1615828811,Well yes I don t think everyone is going to     agree on whether a particular group is a minority   gt If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor I think this is a slippery slope fallacy and not quite true We should always qualify whether a group is a minority based on statistics shared experiences and common sense I don t think every claim at being a minority should be validated but some will be If when we a consensus on the qualification the logic still applies

Feminism,1615822413,I see what you re saying but the statistics do demonstrate that      of rapists are men while there are no statistics to demonstrate that nearly all thieves are black people or that nearly all child molesters are gay If we knew that      of child molesters were from a certain group  orientation race  of course we would keep kids away from that group And even if that rape statistic didn t exist if a woman has had numerous experiences with violence harassment from men and so have all her friends I think that s enough evidence of danger to justify that  prejudice  
Feminism,1615821402,It s a tricky subject because you re absolutely right that women are just protecting themselves from a very real potential threat but when it is advocated so broadly as it is here it feels like trying to carve out an exception just for one circumstance When THEY do it it s prejudice When WE do it it s just protecting ourselves What about people who cross the street or clutch their purse around black people or refuse to trust their money to financial advisors based on their ethnicity or protect their children by not allowing them to be around gay people They all think they re just guarding themselves from a very real threat The only argument you could make to those people is to say  No no but my stereotype is true I m right about this group over here you re just mistaken about THAT group being bad  Your point about focusing on behavior and social structures is dead on well put

Feminism,1615863034,You mentioned that you don t blame guys for this because they grew up with that Implying that boys grow up thinking a certain way  amp I feel like you giving it a negative connotation In you negative experience with someone flirting with you I don t know how pushy the guy was so I can t judge you on your personal experience but if you handled it with an aggressive matter that it didn t match the guys approach then I would consider it fiesty as well But considering you were underage he s a dumbass When it comes to jokes it just depends how much you take it personally I ve had people roast me  amp talk shit but I dont care at the end of the day because their words don t affect me  I don t let it get to me No matter what it is But that s me it just depends how vulnerable you are to things like that I mean if someone has an opinion of you being  feisty it WAY DIFFERENT FROM  ALL MEN SHOULD DIE   Those are two completely different scenarios one of them could possibly potentially dangerous Saying all men should die is threatening it could signal that the person could have a mental illness I mean most hate crimes occur off such word like that  Calling someone  fiesty is not even close to ALL MEN SHOULD DIE  Quite an extreme example Hoodies sweatpants  amp sandals are quite extreme tbh but it doesn t mean that there still ain t some sort of parameter that both females  amp males should follow I mean at the end of the day he s a man Men are attractive to women SURPRISE Obviously if he sees a model on ig he s going to naturally be attracted to it Of course if he s a heterosexual or bi You can t blame him for admiring female beauty But see the difference is models are paid to do their job  amp there job is to look  attractive  I bet that he wouldn t marry someone like that tho because men are very selective with whom they want to be with for the rest of their life So that s where the whole women should act like ladies comes into play Because if your not a model you shouldn t be so explicit That s goes for both men  amp women I mean many men are upset of this feminist movement where they feel like they are being generalized as something they aren t I mean having women generalize that men are rapists violators  amp sex offenders does hurt men to hear because not all of us participate in that horrendous behavior Many of us do put a stop to it  amp call it out even if its with the  boys  Guys know when guys are being assholes some of us do control  amp tell the homies to back off So when you got people coming at you or your type of people it hurts It does affect our gender to have to deal with such harsh claims 
Feminism,1615860218,Dude that s not it at all did you see my other messages  I said I absolutely do not blame guys for this Heck I ve had this conversation with him before and we ve agreed and disagreed He talks the exact way We both blame society for both genders being f caked up Today he talked to me about it the same exact way he didn t change his opinion at all And with school dress codes people took that Too far Why do they still consider knees and shoulders offensive Why is that still a thing And I was defensive back because he started with the defense in some messages previously before the ones in the photos If guys can be defensive we can too Also just because they re  jokes doesn t mean there isn t more behind that Calling it a joke doesn t completely cover everything up That s why jokes are offensive because there is Always something behind it There was a guy who was hitting on me he was over age and I m underage and I made that Very prevalent to him and when I told him off for continuing he called me  feisty because I told him he was wrong  He s allowed to have an opinion but what if certain opinions are blatantly wrong like morally and logically wrong In every way It may seem right to that person because that s how opinions work but what if someone says  all men should die would you like that opinion Would you think that s morally and logically correct Also I said I partially agree with his opinion that intimate clothes should be kept with romantic partners But that doesn t mean all women should only wear hoodies sweatpants and sandals Because that s what he thinks But then he s always sending photos of these girls wearing straight up lingerie for likes and says it s hot   He can t make up his mind I have dealt with this opinion for a while now but I got fed up of him saying it Over and Over and Over again saying girls are all thots and such And him purposely being sexist and purposely upsetting his friends over it for fun when it s clearly a subject that has an affect on our gender 
Feminism,1615859711,Right I agree with most of what you said except for   gt Capitalism may be part of it but non veganism is the real issue You basically answered it below that sentence the only way you get to decommodifying animals and liberating the exploited whether animal or human is by first collapsing capitalism If everyone became Vegan there d still be very poor treatment of animals regardless because of industries that use animals for products however if capitalism falls we are able to start a transition to decommodifying products and necessities if you want to go further we can move to growing meat in labs we have already done it but capitalism prevents us from actually making it something to sell on the market This way you have a transition to a free er and more ethical society 
Feminism,1615857927,I very aggressively want all boys to get out of unhealthy relationships with manipulative girls who make you think what they re doing is totally normal and okay when it s not

Feminism,1615852984,Yes but in the context of the discussion I think more men would be willing to acknowledge systemic violence against women if those issues were also acknowledged  I think many men see statistics on abuse etc and think of it as something they would never do which in their mind diminishes the severity Educating people about why violence against women is still so widespread can help change their perspective 
Feminism,1615849489,You know mental health issues and substance abuse contribute to violence against everyone 
Feminism,1615848842,I know right he s always complaining about how short girls skirts and shorts are dude WHO DO YOU THINK ARE MAKING THOSE CLOTHES I think it s pretty clear women don t have any input when companies are producing those clothes It s all men He complains about it but loves seeing girls wearing that stuff  Like make up your mind

Feminism,1615848361,I define sexual exploitation roughly as using another sentient being for their sexuality reproductive system or sexual capacity in some way whether by overt or subtle force  One need not actually derive pleasure sexually from the exploitation that they are forcing on someone else  e g farmers in the dairy industry do not necessarily get pleasure from it but they still do it  That definition can be refined but I am referring to essentially the ideal of viewing the sentient being as an object and specifically a sexual one What I mean by women betraying other women women who would themselves be at risk of the suffering I am referring to but still choose patriarchy over doing the right thing Women who do FGM Women  and everyone  who aren t vegan Women who traffick other women  or men or children or whoever is being trafficked  Women who join in on misogyny when they are around male friends   amp  x   B I am not referring to someone sexualizing themselves but that may be a part of it Mainly I was referring to the systemic exploitation of women and especially female animals Capitalism may be a part of it but non veganism is the real issue The solution is a paradigm shift in which women are viewed as legal persons and not as objects and a world in which animals have legal personhood and are not used as commodities in any way 
Feminism,1615848231,He literally doesn t do shit He doesn t care Conservatives need to be make obsolete in Australia or else we will be going around in circles 
Feminism,1615847930,I agree with everything here however I have some questions What do you mean by sexual exploitation What do you mean by women betraying other women In my mind I know what sexual exploitation is being forced convinced that doing something you re uncomfortable with sexually because it s  empowering  however I think there s a difference between someone choosing to sexualise themselves and someone who s actively being forced or persuaded into objectification  With that said I think the only way to solve everything you mentioned is to abolish capitalism once that falls you ll see other oppressive entities falling as well with the rise of socialism 
Feminism,1615847024,We need a name for them that sticks like gorilla glue You need to stigmatize that behavior 
Feminism,1615844417,The main reason that  is used is when generalizing statements are applied to men eg   men are killing women  Although the intent of the writer is probably to say  some too many men are killing women  without that modifier in front the true meaning of the statement is that  men in general are killing women I think that men have a right to defend themselves from statements like the one above that generalize the entire gender Generalizing statements are not really fair when applied to anyone and usually result in unnecessary prejudice and judgement   Not all     are       but enough of them are  is not really a good rebuttal in my opinion You cannot justify generalizations about groups of people just because they may be accurate in some cases Try filling in those blanks with any other identity group besides men and it becomes clear why men respond defensively If a muslim hears    Not all muslims are wife beaters but enough of them are  used as justification in order to group them in with wife beaters they will defend themselves from that prejudicial generalization 
Feminism,1615843216,No it isn t too many More than    of men have never done anything like that You keep defining them by their gender instead of their actions Call them bullies catcallers and rapists but stop generalizing a population of over  billion based on the actions of less than    of it If you want to define criminals by their gender no woman should ever be fit to be a parent because the majority of child homicides and child abuse is done by women But when it comes to them you rightfully call them abusers and murderers instead of generalizing them by their gender Give us the same courtesy 
Feminism,1615841953,Or they realize it and feminism is a very convenient mask 
Feminism,1615841754,If he is generally a kind supportive partner then I d be inclined to assume this is just a bit of a blind spot for him and a very clumsy attempt to make you feel less scared  My fiance is a good listener and tends not to give unsolicited opinions on stuff but he has his blind spots and he can be pretty useless emotionally sometimes lol  The important thing I ve found is to just tell him when what he is doing  or not doing isn t hitting the mark For example he tends to just want space when he is stressed out or emotional so his tendency is to give me space  ie basically ignore me when I m emotional  At first I found that incredibly hurtful but over time we both learned that we just have different knee jerk approaches to things so we need to ask for what we want Now when I m emotional or upset and I want to be comforted I just tell him that   I m really upset right now and I want you to listen to me and comfort me  It sounds so ridiculous but it works and he does a great job And when he needs space and I m all up in his business trying to get him to tell me all his feelings he asks me to please just let him do his thing In your case I d suggest you tell him that the way he responded made you feel dismissed and that you want him to be more open to listening to your perspective on issues that affect you as a woman like being afraid to walk alone at night See how he responds to that If he gets defensive call him out on it and bring the focus back to you just trying to be heard and have your emotional needs met 
Feminism,1615841712,This is what I always think whenever NotAllMen stuff comes up These men act like rape is the only issue we care about and that it exists in a vacuum Rape is propped up and encouraged by the things listed in this tweet  it exists within the context of rape culture which exists within the context of patriarchy This is a system that we are all apart of and we have all perpetuated at some point in our lives Solutions come from admitting our faults and working to change the system  not drowning out conversation by shouting about how good and innocent we are

Feminism,1615880706,Because gender and the power imbalance between the genders are intrinsic to violence against women and the reason it is allowed to continue  Terrorism is not intrinsic to islam  its intrinsic to extremist ideals and various other factors   If you dont see that but would rather get upset that we have to share the responsibility of the benefits we receive from a patriarchal society that calls women hysterical when they report abuse refuse to prosecute men because her word isnt enough and then imprison them when they act in self defence I m afraid there is little point in this discussion

Feminism,1615868858,So if I m understanding the question Should people be more afraid in a financially poor high crime area I think we can disregard race but obviously people will use that as an excuse to single people out Violent crime is clearly one of symptoms of poverty but it isn t a limiting factor You don t need to be poor to have power and abuse it I think maybe violence is the most accessable form of power So in a poor community violence or at least the threat of it is a quick and easy way to have power where you otherwise have very little Of course you have the flip side where the powerful can use violence simply because they have power I think the relationship is all other things being equal  which they are not  most men have the availability to exerte power over most women in the form of and threat of violence Maybe poor communities are the same in that regard The greater potential for violence is baked into the society if you will  And well not all fear is rational We are certainly all afraid of things that will do us no harm We are also unafraid of things that can or will do us harm But the the perceived potential causes very real fear Sometimes that fear is rooted in bad things like racism Anyway don t listen to me too much I ve written and this about four times now My points feel week and I m not even sure I know what I m saying But you put some time and effort into your post and I wanted to reciprocate Hopefully this is far enough down in an old enough post no one else will ever read it

Feminism,1615917383,Honestly is not that much different from any other form of fiction Japan has never been specially on the vanguard of feminism equality and many animes are at its core the product of just one person s mind which can be flawed and I believe the majority are men There s also the clich and vicious circle of being written for male audiences which alienates female audiences which in turn feeds the male audience excuses I believe it ll get better as every other media has 
Feminism,1615916098,Actually you re right Thanks for understanding my point as well I was just thinking that since not everyone would actively help someone who gets assaulted by which I mean that if it happens on the street the big majority of people would just turn their backs it s a pretty relevant thing if they actually call the police or help in any other way  But yeah there are also cases in which it s only the bare minimum such as like you said speaking up against racism or correcting a friend for rude jokes

Feminism,1615915316,Or make a nonsense naturalist argument and make silly comparisons to animals  like chimps where males are supreme you know how like people   th century justified colonialism and slavery 
Feminism,1615910985,I agree in some ways and not in others First of all everyone going vegan would result in animal exploitation industries to collapse and move to other alternatives since no one is paying for their services And if a tipping point is reached and not everyone is vegan they may be toppled sooner Whether or not capitalism is also toppled may be irrelevant and even if capitalism is toppled that does not mean that the world will be vegan Most anti capitalists are not vegan and and most discussions about capitalism are done by people currently using animals as resources They are willing to give up capitalism but if asked no way would they give up their animal products The underlying beliefs that animals should be used as resources for food clothing food and experimentation is not necessarily a capitalist idea but rather an imperialist and colonial idea that others should be slaves  might is right  capitalism comes later  Therefore we need to get rid of the underlying speciesist belief first and anti capitalism cannot be divorced from that AOC is against capitalism and she s not advocating veganism as a moral baseline Bernie Sanders is against capitalism but no way would he give up  his animal products

Feminism,1615983673,I think a lot of it also has to do with inherent habits that have become normalized for instance the locker room talk Men do it amongst themselves and talk about such horrible things but aren t called out in fact the popular verdict  men will be men is thrown around Well men are being allowed to become misoginists 
Feminism,1615981271,First of all most developing countries in the world sustain themselves off of vegan staples such as beans rice legumes grains Meat and dairy is a luxury Of course there are some people who simply cannot access any good food at all but that s not a why veganism is flawed argument that s just another way in which our global food system is injust  to animals and to humans clearly  As well we currently have enough food to feed   billion people but we choose to use those crops to fatten up animals whom we then murder  turning them into products that go primarily to well off individuals in the west If we care about the fair distribution of foods globally veganism is the only coherent option Can you go vegan Are you vegan Often people point out someone else s disadvantage as a way to say  well that person over there is disabled poor etc and they can t go vegan therefore I am not going to go vegan  This is illogical and it s also selfish to use someone else s disadvantage to justify your own inaction I agree toppling capitalism would be beneficial but again it s an ideology of non veganism that is the primary issue I agree humans need to be liberated as well but that also translates to  We are humans who oppress and slaughter billions of animals and I refuse to liberate those animals until I have my own freedom  We can all choose to not oppress animals by being vegan and most people can go vegan  And if they can t go vegan there are things that are not related to their diet that they can do not go to circuses not buy pets unless they re adopting not buy fur and leather etc  And yes getting rid of speciesism is a huge step in the right direction because that would mean everyone or most of the world has gone vegan and therefore there simply isn t any demand for animal exploitation because everyone has declared  I am vegan I will not willfully participate in animal use and so all corporations and countries would be forced to change  of course it s more complicated  Again there aren t many anti capitalists who are vegan and those leading the political fight  Bernie AOC in the American case would not further veganism since it s not something they perosnally practise

Feminism,1615968872,I  think that by adding cloths it s not possible to find any solution and that  the solution actually goes in the reverse way to remove them without clothing it s not possible to define what s provocative to wear so the  provocation moves to the behavior that is the best definition And actually when people is full naked  in a naturist nudist environment gender differences blur out and on top it removes sexuality that is the other  driver of inequality

Feminism,1615967649,It s called  hetero patriarchy  The vast majority of healthy population want a system based on social justice and that of course includes no abuse nor discrimination However a minority wants to keep privileges and for that it s critical to them to abuse the rest and avoid the logical rebellion  This is very hard to sell as such so the narrative works a lot better when it s sold as an abuse chain  So the   privileged class abuse the     but to a percentage      of that    there is giving the other half to abuse The first half are the men and the second are women To the men is told that to protect their privilege above women they must also protect the   privilege And most men bought it Of course that   also spike it with more stuff like nativism racial privilege etc   but the thing is it s really easy to give to each man a woman to abuse because the proportion is     It s not so easy to give to each male a racial slave So women abuse works very well Then the rest of the narrative it s just for filling in victim gaslighting extremism labeling to whoever points the reality intimidation to shut up and keep playing that impossible to win game etc

Feminism,1616874278, gt One of the interesting points not illustrated in this graph is that the amount of money an occupation pays is significantly related to the  of men in it Well of course it is it s an average of all jobs whether male or female dominated Of course summing this up will show that men make more because there are more fields dominantly men than there is women and the men in those positions are making more than the women in other fields of work How is that unfair   gt It s that work that is thought to be masculine is more inherently valued than work that s thought to be feminine These issues are certainly related but it s interesting to see how deeply the pay gap is integrated into the workforce Have you done any research into why the gender pay gap exists There s many more variables than just simply men make more Ive  worked in the trades with women who make the same as I do can t produce the same as I do but still are paid the same the same as men who can t necessarily produce the same There are many female dominated disciplines where women are paid very well the same as men sometimes more The pay gap is more complicated than just simply it s not equal men make more than women  Take nursing for example predominantly female paid very well not more or less than men in the field but based on their time in the field to a cap then raises with the rise of inflation the same as their peers Equally governed trades which are    dominated by men women are not paid less they are paid the same but you have to introduce more variables than just masculine vs feminine valued work to get a more conclusive depiction of why there is a   wage gap Search any countries occupational breakdown by gender and you ll see the clear divide of which gender fill jobs more than others and if you understand the major differences between men and women as a whole you ll know why the gap exists we are different in two such ways that s makes us choose certain careers But you also have to take into account simply this     do women want jobs in these fields that are dominantly men most cases no If it was the latter you would be forcing equality of outcome and I don t think anyone wants that in a world where many factors decide who gets a job and the opportunity Women who are firefighters when compared to men make the same amount of money or have the same opportunity to make the same money Not all women want to be firefighters you need to be a certain type of person to work in the field women aren t built for it the same as men biologically speaking they don t have the same muscle mass testosterone aggressiveness   but does that mean for the women who do work in those fields do they get paid less of course not  I just fail to see where your argument and frankly anyone else who doesn t see the clear divide of male dominated work that is more masculine being paid more Well of course because there are more men working in the field so naturally they will be paid more as a collective driving the average up    Is it so hard to believe that Childcare workers for example are predominantly women     and those women are in that position cause they want to be there or dental assistants which make up       How come more men aren t in that line of work I m sure Burly Lumberjack Bill wants to be a childcare worker    no he doesn t because he s aggressive by nature and women dominate those fields because they have more compassion and you don t want aggressive Bill playing around in your mouth There are      Carpenters in Ontario compared to      dental assistants Should the carpenters get paid more than the dental assistants in terms of job not by the determination of masculinity or femininity but danger of the job working in the elements Of course they should and it just so happens that it is a very labor intensive job would a large percentage of the female population do that job    no it takes masculine traits now whether you agree or not the fact is biologically it is a masculine job does that mean that females are inherently undervalued to perform such work No they choose not to do to such work There is an inherent difference when it comes to equality of outcome and equality of opportunity Misreading something that isn t fact and projecting it as something else is not understanding or educating yourself properly on the issue 
Feminism,1616873218,paraphrasing here but something along the lines of  if feminists are so strong we shouldn t let men affect our emotions

Feminism,1615991768,My last sentence where I say my point is that it isn t necessarily from a lack of care is what I was trying to say You hear more people are dying and you think lack of healthcare services discrimination shitty doctors whatever but if the population is growing obviously the rates of death will go up too But on top of that people are getting sicker cases are getting worse so again not necessarily due to a failing healthcare system though in the US it s certainly a contributing factor 
Feminism,1615991328,There s only so many times I can hear acKsHuaLly    in one day 
Feminism,1615990989,I m all ears to hear your  well thought out position about how sexual assault and racism aren t bad 
Feminism,1615990887, gt For me I appreciate devil s advocate in a scenario where I don t know exactly where I stand but I want to press the person to explain more why their position is appealing But this often results in bad faith arguments because the person is arguing a position they don t hold often by claiming a position of authority that they don t actually possess It s much more honest imo to just say  I m not entirely sure on my position yet My concerns with your perspective is x y z  That sort of articulation is helpful in building the trust and respect you describe 
Feminism,1615990855,What do you think sexual assault is Also I m still waiting to hear the  racism is ok sometimes nuanced argument  And the  sexual assault is acceptable when argument  
Feminism,1615990712,How about devil s advocate as a tool to find a more nuanced position for yourself This must be expressed in a respectful way in a context of trust but surely in such a scenario it can be useful to express tropes  which possibly you are inconclusive on to a person in order to allow them to better explain a well thought position to someone less well thought 
Feminism,1615990565,The original tweet doesn t reference  rape is bad it says there can be no devil advocate position surrounding sexual assault or racism So that is to say that in no way is their nuance to be found in how every single person thinks about every aspect of both those concepts Obviously nonsense 
Feminism,1615990365,lol can t argue that i m not a white dude having theoretical discussions however the idea that a white male is not impacted by gender sexism and the discussion surrounding those concepts is total nonsense It s a shame that there are some who would wish to respond to those who take an interest in experience outwith their own as attempting to frustrate them purely because they defend the concept of an honest devil s advocate 
Feminism,1615990187,Right here     Completely and utterly disagree to      Without genuine trust and respect though it is true devil s advocate is useless in any scenario even more so in ones where the knowledge produced is used to oppress and subjugate as knowledge associated with race and gender often is     You asserted something to be devils advocate to the OP Then you backed off of it immediately proving that your first assertion was the  bad kind of devils advocate 
Feminism,1615989974,How have I abandoned the position My position is that devil s advocate CAN be useful Where have I abandoned that argument 
Feminism,1615989741,So    what s the alternate to  rape is bad   racism is bad  Do tell 
Feminism,1615989730,Your first comment completely disagree when discussing racism and sexual assault we  absolutely need someone to play devils advocate    Your second comment playing devils advocate can be beneficial in some scenarios but there s a nuance to it    Pick a lane friend 
Feminism,1615989366,So when you  play devil s advocate  you re quite literally repeating the status quo telling us stuff that we already know  because not only do we too live in this space and time and therefore comprehend the norms of this cultural and historical place but we also are actively thinking outside of that box which first requires us to know that box really really well And you re not so radically reinforcing that we should remain in that box  
Feminism,1615989327,Devil s advocate does not have to be a case of someone asserting themselves then abandoning a position but I agree there are many who do that For me I appreciate devil s advocate in a scenario where I don t know exactly where I stand but I want to press the person to explain more why their position is appealing For example as a kid at a Catholic school the anti abortion message was drummed in quite hard Abortion was something I struggled to take a coherent position on in which I was always comfortable but it was noticeable that the science led of my peers were pro choice To pick their brains without knowledge of biology it was necessary for me to say  It is impossible for you to define logically when is fine to abort and when is not if you ignore the point of conception as that line in order to access their knowledge of the reality of the development of the fetus in the early stages as basically a tiny clump of cells and not a living human being in a womb Without genuine trust and respect though it is true devil s advocate is useless in any scenario even more so in ones where the knowledge produced is used to oppress and subjugate as knowledge associated with race and gender often is 
Feminism,1615988852,No I don t believe these deaths include homicide I ve seen it anywhere from homicide  usually by husband bf lover being the cause of    of all pregnancy related deaths Heart disease being     But numbers may be different now 
Feminism,1615988441,Introducing alternative views sure   but to what end If it s about anticipating counterarguments or adding genuinely needed nuance that s fine but that s not really playing devil s advocate If it s  I m going to assert my intellectual superiority by arguing a position that I don t even hold or that I deny holding when challenged  that s insincere and counterproductive and can do real damage in an organizing context

Feminism,1616977818,   Like point   it is watching an objective skill level of under   s boys playing which no one does   Women professional soccer teams play at a skill level less than that of under   s mens  proven many times just google womens national team vs under   s mens  So although comparably elite against each other for the consumer it is equivalent to watching under   boys playing which no one does    Women s sports can sell but it happens that most of the consumers of sport are men and therefore the women have to appeal to men  maybe there s an entire untapped female audience which could shift things   Examples of elite females selling at the same level of men are Ronda Rousey and Amanda Nunez Although comparatively rare they garner the exact same respect as men of the UFC because of how outstanding they are I think one other reason they are so successful is that their fights are on the same card as the men s fights and so the consumer  mostly male don t have to go searching specifically for their fights it s all under one roof Maybe women s football would do well if it was on the same day same stadium as the men s and with one ticket you could watch both  as is done with ufc    Interesting point but I don t have anything to add to it at this stage I would love to see it happen though    You can personally change this You and your friends can buy stadium tickets shirts etc etc  But it won t happen because like point  the consumers are mostly men Not      there are women much more interested in sports than some men but on average a  bloke is much more into the sports fandom

Feminism,1616971085,It s just so alien to me I know a girl who wanted nothing more than to pop out kids and get married the second she graduated school To me that is well    very limited and to my mind pathetic She s a nice girl and everything she married a childhood friend of mine and I see them every now and then at gatherings I m   now and she s about     They have  kids and as far as I am aware she has been nothing more than a stay at home mom all this time since finishing school No real jobs during that time Career what s that Just spends her time parenting though unsure what her quality of parenting is seeing as she had a kid when she was still essentially a kid herself  personally I don t think barely adults  essentially still children should be having children  At that age her brain isn t fully formed and she didn t have any wisdom or life lessons to impart  I m nice and friendly to her in person and all that but she s not  my people at all I disagree with her life decisions and I simply have nothing in common with her She isn t a deep person or an intellectual so I really have nothing to talk to her about as in my mind she is the epitome of  limited   And if I were to say any of that out loud to pretty much anyone I would be branded as a horrible person Oh well sorry that I think people shouldn t have kids until they have made something of themselves  have finances secure housing etc to support the kid and aren t still kids themselves If that s what a horrible person is then I wear that badge with pride

Feminism,1616952715,People previously had to use sick leave  or other forms of leave or some people may have had this in their collective agreement already in these circumstances The new law means that paid bereavement leave  of three days I think for miscarriage stillbirth is a legal entitlement for all workers ie a new additional form of leave guaranteed for everyone  Likely with exceptions eg part time workers may get it pro rated casual employees are very unlikely to get it
Feminism,1617039031,Yeah it would be easier now that some people pack their own straws the whole thing is terrifying
Feminism,1617038621,Yes I had this occur to me at a house party with my friend when I was    still below the legal age in my country  which is     but common to drink low  drinks at that age It was a small party with my main  friend group The  bartender tried to secretly add vodka from behind the damn curtain Luckily I saw and called him out

Feminism,1617036699,Your opinion does count but if you want to get it across effectively there are better ways to do it Also woman and men stay In abusive relationships for multiple reasons but it s mainly how there manipulated over time I don t think everyone can find themselves in such a situation but some people are more vulnerable to manipulation than others it s a lot to explain I d say research it a little listen to people s stories I only truly grasped it when someone close to me talked about there story 
Feminism,1617036464,I m afraid to get an answer for this but do you think woman can victim blame other women blaming male victims I can kinda see  
Feminism,1617036418,My opinion doesn t count Part of the problem Just because you have a cow doesn t mean you have milk The cow has to be fed You also have to physically milk her You don t buy it but it isn t free   All I know is to many holler about being a victim Get out of that situation Why are women attracted to men that abuse them Then stay with them 
Feminism,1617036312,Damn Athena is truly the perfect example of victim blaming Now that I think about it turning dudes into stone is kind of like a victim lashing out in an unhealthy way You know like isolating themselves or hurting themselves that s not good for them or others and the curse aspect could be viewed as society victim blaming forcing them to do these actions 
Feminism,1617035706,It s cool if you disagree with modern feminism but I just don t think this is how you should go about it Plus insulting people isn t how you get them to see your point of view plus your statement just comes off as pretty childish so no one would take your opinion into account 
Feminism,1617035251,Medusa used to be a human woman then Poseidon raped her in Athena s temple Athena then turned her into a monster for desecrating her temple making her a symbol for victim blaming After she got cursed one can read her as taking revenge on men trying to intrude where they don t belong Plus the snake hair and turning people to stone is just badass 
Feminism,1617035164,These men like natural until it comes down to body hair yellowing aging teeth facial hair crooked teeth All those things are natural but I can assure you people that make comments about makeup are the same ones who dislike all of those things on a female

Feminism,1617026408,I don t have anything to say about that jerk ass millitary man s attitude towards women and the general attitude of millitary organization against the participation of women in armed forces and their delusion that women lowers the quality  whatever that means  I am come from a country where history is witness to many legendary female warriors and queens who with their strategic brilliance defeated their enemies So I know that this quality argument is nothing but sham Here read this interesting piece about women from Cave man times   And show these to those who say women are inferior in terms of physical strength as compared to men I think hunting is seriously demanding activity from both mental and physical perspective and in those times unimaginably fatal So if women could do that at that time of scarcity and ruggedness I don t think there could be any problem in  employing them in military other than the aversion of stubborn higher ups who are all males just a blind guess and their unwillingness to evolve the millitary culture from their self proclaimed ruggedness  which is nothing more than toxicity disguised as Avenue of making you mentally strong Sorry for being a late replier

Feminism,1617019586,It s honestly so sad that they even have to create this It s so easy to not drug someone just keep your hands and stuffs to yourself 
Feminism,1617019013,Yes you absolutely right Countries which are developing and are underdeveloped need feminism more than anything And yeah we especially need to spread awareness about those I ll surely cover it in my upcoming blog Thank you for your advice it means a lot   
Feminism,1617018943,If you ll find a reference to the nail polish please share sounds amazing 
Feminism,1617018411,The biggest problem is that the most common date rape drug is stronger alcohol 
Feminism,1617018274,This is so annoying   like you re putting make up on to please him or any other random dude  I love your reaction 
Feminism,1617017889,As amazing as these ideas are I have found that these things tend to be difficult to afford and or access  Not to mention it once again puts the onus on women to check for date rape drugs rather than expecting men to be accountable and not do it  And it also speaks volumes that date rape drugs are somehow much easier to access  considering how often it happens than these straws nailpolish etc that test for it  Creating it is one thing and it s really great but making it accessible and affordable to more than just a select few is what needs to be achieved  And we also should work to make it harder to access date rape drugs and increase awareness in clubs bars concerts etc  to be aware of spiking and taking precautions to make sure cases are reduced and men who spike are held accountable not the women who failed to buy expensive straws and have it shipped from a foreign country and were therefore drugged 
Feminism,1617016575,I ve been hearing about these goddamn straws for long enough now  they aren t readily available at all I cannot find a link anywhere for purchase or anything beyond  women made a straw Great But where the fuck is it   If you want to help with date rapes then maybe make the products available  
Feminism,1617015489,I named two in the post you are replying to it s right up there
Feminism,1617074244, gt While they are related I think too many of these guys are completely capable of empathy James Fallon in the interview I linked above points out that there are a couple of different types of predators Some are capable of empathy He argues that those who are capable of understanding this are more evil than those who are not He also talks about different types of empathy  empathy with individuals vs empathy with entire groups vs cognitive empathy vs emotional empathy  It s an interesting listen 
Feminism,1617068521,Wouldn t the feeling of getting buzzed be enough to know that you should slow down Though I guess a lot of hear girls are inexperienced drinkers who go by drink count rather than actually monitoring how in control of their faculties they are 
Feminism,1617068335,While they are related I think too many of these guys are completely capable of empathy They just don t empathize with their victims They are selfish and don t see the consequences of their actions beyond that it will help them get what they want  And of course there are those who like the thrill of violence against women 
Feminism,1617065978,This article is terrible The headline is a blatant lie  cannot be found guilty of rape because the woman got drunk voluntarily beforehand this is absolutely not what the court said  The decision Wednesday overturned no it was not overturned it was remanded Please read the comments  here on r politics   for some fantastic information on what this all actually means  I do want to make clear that there is crappy stuff going on with this case and the laws but  it s not what this article is making it sound like 
Feminism,1617065221,Saw this info earlier My first thought was  if a predator specifically targets intoxicated individuals  wouldn t that carry a heavier charge because they are intentionally preying on the lesser mentally capable Does this apply if the attacker breaks into my house when I am intoxicated Or only if I am drunk in public  So basically best of luck if you get drunk and someone sexually assults you 
Feminism,1617063737,I have no idea but this guy s response is awful right As in he s the one getting all this love on tiktok  amp I m so confused Guys everywhere saying he s  spitting facts  Is he saying because we bare children it s ok to call women hoes when we ve had more than  partner 
Feminism,1617062121,It s a hate crime but perhaps we need to consider an effective legal framework for misogyny that stands on its own terms apart from the existing framework of hate crimes and hate speech A very good read on this  
Feminism,1617057220,I don t understand these things do happen to men why does she need support 
Feminism,1617054146,As a woman it is probably not your duty to be an activist I think it s on us men to fix this I understand you will feel bad for all the misogyny but don t feel bad because you think you re not a good enough feminist The only way a woman is not a good enough feminist is if she actively promotes the conservative lifestyle and norms of husband does work and wife makes food You are good enough as you are I think 
Feminism,1617053678,That is horrendous I m sorry your parents didn t have your back on that But I m glad to hear you learned it wasn t your fault 
Feminism,1617053239,The fact that you  have your mom on your side makes you a lot safer too you are less likely to be targeted than people with toxic and unprotective or even accusatory families I know I got targeted when i was very young because when i had a teacher inappropriately acting towards me and I turned to my parents for help  expecting they would talk to the school they said  what did you do to make that man think he can act like that around you  I didn t effing know I was    I know now what I did and that was nothing I did nothing to make that man think he could act like that around me But at the time I absorbed it and thought it was my fault and not understanding that is how things got bad later in life because I thought that behavior in men was normal 
Feminism,1617052827,I get that I have a vaguely creepy odd Walmart coworker who I keep an eye out for  he s kind of clingy without being attracted to me which is just weird to me and my mom even said to keep an eye out for him  When you let your guard down it might happen  whatever  it would be So I completely get the  I happens when you feel like you should be safe  I ve read enough stories on here about women suddenly getting their male friends attention such as after she had a break up to know that even my own male friends could become vile and untrustworthy
Feminism,1617052294,That s ok It s one of those things that if you are expecting it it s less likely to happen when it does happen is when you feel safe if that makes any sense  The end result being you never feel safe ever again so that s fun I m perpetually exhausted now even though I ve become a recluse 
Feminism,1617051355,Oh definitely but if I can purposefully cut off my intake of the most common date rape drug then all the better I m not dropping my guard though Edit Also I definitely didn t read past the first sentence I don t think I had my head on straight or was skimming the comments when I usually read all of a comment before responding my mistake if it sounded very out of place with the rest of your comment
Feminism,1617050523, I also like women with long hair  That makes them uncomfortable most of the time 
Feminism,1617048836,I can personally easily taste a diff between  and  shots even in a fruity drink Or even double But I definitely get the point haha
Feminism,1617046461,It s so rare to actually be drugged by those substances though it just makes a flashy headline Alcohol and more conventional street drugs are what s involved in the overwhelming majority of these kinds of rapes 
Feminism,1617045935,This would have happened even if there wasn t alcohol they were hunting
Feminism,1617045553,Both are valid takes rape isnt something that happens in a vaccum and there is usually some level of blame that can be placed on the rapists friends family and the community they were a part of etc for not preventing what happened or not alerting the authorities 
Feminism,1617044366,They re are definitely interesting modern interpretations of those stories that are feminist But given that most Greco Roman mythology was written by men in times when women had very few rights you probably won t find much thats feminist in its original intention To find genuinely pro woman mythology you might want to look at some spiritual traditions from less sexist societies 
Feminism,1617042628,This was the Minnesota Supreme Court not just a single judge 
Feminism,1617042526,This is just part of the reason I basically swore off alcohol before I even turned   
Feminism,1617042283,I am looking forward to this being overturned quickly and the judge publicly shamed 
Feminism,1617041027,I m sure you know plenty of women in your life who do not consider themselves feminists It s way easier to subscribe to the patriarchal narrative and blame the victim than to question popular thinking So yeah women can definitely blame female victims and they do One s gender does not absolve anyone from toxic behaviour of any kind

Feminism,1617111274,That s what I was thinking too For all its rapey bullshit American Pie glorifies what a lot of people  especially older men see as  normal sexual behavior Because of this it comes off as  minimally abrasive to that crowd who were likely the ones doing the rating  I wish I hadn t watched shows like American Pie as a young teen They are capable of warping your perception of other people specifically those you are attracted to into subjects for domination  On a side note I d love to see a movie that sexually empowers men  without simultaneously degrading and objectifying women

Feminism,1617136495,If there s anything I ve learned it s like there s actually a widespread fetish in men for enjoying it more when we re unwilling and it s like an unwillingness spectrum too From being less attracted to women who ve had a lot of partners all the way to r    willingness seems to determine our value and their desires So yes it s pretty fucked up

Feminism,1617133848,They especially love showing close ups of women s faces when expressing the terror and pain of rape It s so common I refer to it as Hollywood s Rape Fetish The man s face is rarely shown during rape scenes so they can show more of the woman s as she fights an  inevitable action In this way they present us with a visual version of the passive voice the media prefers to use when discussing rape One rarely hears  a man raped a woman    rather they say  a woman was raped    This is the same Instead of focusing on the man who is taking the man who is raping they focus on the woman being raped They show her terror and panic as she realizes what s about to happen They show them submissively weeping and begging They make time to show her clothes being ripped up off as well as making sure we hear  the  sound of the fabric tearing through the use of post production sound editing They ll often include a wide shot of the rapist from the side or behind  not to say anything about the man doing the raping  but rather as a way of showing the violence of his thrusts so that we re assured her suffering is both physical AND spiritual It s   disgusting   how much filmmakers do this I can only assume there s some part of them getting off on her pain as she is tortured with rape But close ups of a woman s face as she s orgasming during consensual sex  Blasphemy

Feminism,1617125165,I think that the most important take away here is that  learned helplessness is often used to explain why women suffer from increased anxiety and depression when it is most likely  as this study found not true I haven t read the full study but my overall impression from other research is that vulnerable groups face more mental health challenges because of the micro and macro aggressions they deal with daily

Feminism,1615660591,Your reasons are something only you truely know If something about those reasons gives you concern in your very heart of hearts  it would be smart to maks sure you know why you want it and that its a reason you can live with after the fact regardless of the outcome  Personally the only reason I don t get a boob lift or botox  well two reasons  I can t afford either  LOL and I m not sure I d be ok with myself if it didn t turn out as planned Sure  would be easier not wearing a bra  but are the risks worth the expense Yeah would love to have a few less wrinkles on my brow but ack  what if it hurts me instead of getting rid of the wrinkles  Hell  I really want lasik because I am so near sighted that I can t wear glasses It would be nice to be able to wear glasses Argh  but what if    Feminism or  the standard of beauty has nothing to do with my hesitations

Feminism,1615657837,Feminism is about women having options and opportunities free from the oppression and expectations based on the constructs gender Therefore feminism should support women equally whether they decide cosmetic plastic surgery is right for them or not Additionally feminism does not support the subjecting of women into a single paradigm of beauty which is often how plastic surgery is advertised to manipulate women The problem isn t women choosing to get cosmetic plastic surgery the problem is the system that bombards women to believing they are flawed and their beauty is their most valuable asset Furthermore there are many other factors that complicate the topic even further such as dangerous fake surgeons classism in beauty standards racism in beauty standards cultural appropriation rising through cosmetic procedures etc  Each woman makes their her own decisions and feminism supports that 
Feminism,1615656902,but does she know Pythagoras s theorem to the third decimal  s
Feminism,1615656113,One would think having control over your own personage in that way would be aligned with the feminist ideals I certainly don t judge anyone who has the guts to go through that much agony to feel better about themselves  I think many people believe others get elective plastic surgery in order to be more attractive That s just not true for all At the end of the day  being comfortable in your own skin is something we all want Good on them for making it happen 
Feminism,1615655370,I m not sure what you mean with  advocating for plastic surgery but I am of the opinion that everyone should be able to do whatever they want with their body  Of course there are several different motivations with not medically necessary plastic surgery and a lot of it seems to be linked to insecurity and or the male gaze  But I wouldn t ever judge someone for deciding to change something about themselves I see it as an act of autonomy and also not giving a fuck about people criticizing women for it 
Feminism,1615650690,You know almost all wars have started because of competition for resources not emotions right I m I don t have to   mansplain  anything to you because you re deliberately being disingenuous 
Feminism,1615650021,you re equating being hysterical with starting wars is kind of a stretch though right
Feminism,1615649264,Wow so you respond with more sexism Imagine if men walked around using a term like say  womandriving  using it to mock women who drive or park poorly This is actually a thing  it used be common to roll your eyes and say  woman driver when a woman drove poorly and you can still see Youtube videos mocking them That would be pretty annoying and sexist right Now imagine if someone complained about that term and someone responded with  If women would stop driving bad the term would stop being used  Sexism is wrong You are never going to win the struggle against sexism against women if you use sexism against men as your weapon You ll just perpetuate it 
Feminism,1615647802,If men would stop doing it the term would stop being used
Feminism,1615643861,The is perfect murdered by words material right I don t know how to link though 
Feminism,1615643856,It used to be known as  a little knowledge is dangerous  meaning that knowing a small amount about a subject can lead you to think you know more than if you have deep knowledge 
Feminism,1615642957,Everyone should be careful when out alone   no one can tell murderers thieves and kidnappers to stop their crimes but instead we can tell people to be careful to minimize the accruing of such crimes Stop throw it on genders and blame one over another that s a childish  and let s all takes responsibility both men and women to reduce the possibility of it happening more often 
Feminism,1615641750,All those comments    Let me explain it to you It is a well proven scientific fact that men will assume women to know way less about pretty much anything except child rearing clothing makeup    Archetypical fem things  This combined with the confidence that men are taught to have because they feel they are supposed to know everything Results in bad faith interpretation of things women say taking the weakest possible interpretation and trying to explain something to them that they already know But this works also in tandem with the Dunning Krueger effect where men don t know how little they know about a topic  E g feminism and they think So they confidently mensplain feminism to women with no idea what they are talking about Hence so many comments under this post 
Feminism,1615641087,My roommate told me the same story O o  She was already really good and was earning money with it and he had no idea what he was talking about 
Feminism,1615640543,Thank you for posting this Sad that Russia has such patriarchal values  though no country is perfect in that regard either  
Feminism,1615640016, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action

Feminism,1615636142,We change into trainers to walk home so we can run if necessary  Keys may not actually be combat effective but a lot of weapons that we might think would be useful are illegal in many countries 
Feminism,1615635478,So I ll go over your comment point by point Me talking about my degree is to communicate that I know the research that prove that man who belittle do so because they are ignorant nothing more No no one owes me an explanation unless all they do is being rude which is the only kind of reaction I got here How am I questionning the lived reality of women  I certainly am not I was arguing about what is and what isn t mansplaining because this expression was inappropriatly used here imo  No feminist here has been open for discussion as soon as they determined I was a man questionning the nature of the concept of mansplaining  I m almost certain you re gonna learn little from this well you missed my point entirely so yeah not much to learn 
Feminism,1615634592,How can you assess that  feminists are too quickly to call out mansplaining  By your degree Don t you think others on here have degrees as well or what If you do  how the hell does that matter in this context   Completely missed the mark there Feminists are pretty open for discussion and good faith questions Imo They still don t owe you an explanation though  People are upset because you came here not to learn something or to grow but to question and discredit the lived reality of women  Because you are part of the targeted group and it automatically sends you into defensive mode  You arguing about instances where a man legitimately corrects a woman  all while being presented with a very clear example is exactly that That s what happening here and people see right through it  hence the downvotes  Here s what people like you often fail to understand It s not about you  Women don t care about your degree or whether you re a good person We re talking about a  system of oppression in which there s a bias against certain people in this case women  I m almost certain you ll gonna learn little from this but at least you can t argue how much your  critique has been dismissed  even though you re not entitled to a discussion  And maybe some more curious and open minded man will find this and understands a bit more about feminism and its talking points Have a good one 
Feminism,1615682179,Try reading what OP posted ten times Might help Read it aloud maybe  I don t fucking know what to tell you   Maybe if more people with your opinion instead focused their ire and frustration on the men who are letting down the side and less on the people who hold men accountable you might get somewhere eventually  You kind of sound a bit like the type of person who says all lives matter 
Feminism,1615681730,Yes and we will probably never agree I m okay with that but you didn t answer my question 
Feminism,1615681500,I m going to get down voted and called some names I m sure  Why is it not socially acceptable to lump all of ANY other group together but it s perfectly fine to lump most all men together  If I m right most people who will defend this meme would speak out against memes that generalize women  even if it doesn t say ALL women  When a meme or a post says  men are    it s labeling men in general Just like when something says  women are    or  all young people are    
Feminism,1615679858,I used to think ftw was  Fuck the world so I feel you Worked surprisingly well in place of the real meaning
Feminism,1615677550,I think you may have missunderstood my point because I didn t really present it well  I agree Not just on the internet but overall when you start arguments when you are emotional it is unlikely that anyone will leave the argument with a changed view I didn t defend emotional responces I just think that topic like this will easly get poeple to act defensive as something about them is being criticized 
Feminism,1615675820,I am arguing in good faith I am not being the least bit aggressive If you don t want to argue with me that s your right but my points stand 
Feminism,1615675159,no one of the rules is goo faith you are vary much not making any points in good faith and are being aggressive so I am not going to argue with you 
Feminism,1615673552,Gee didn t see that comment coming No I didn t  mansplain anything And your comment does nothing to refute my argument  I didn t refute the idea behind  mansplaining being sexist toward women either I said the term is sexist Please read my comment again 
Feminism,1615671198,Same as when trump implied Mexicans were all rapist s or when racists accuse all minorities of being criminals   It s obvious they don t mean everyone of them are all those things  Why don t people get it Not  notallmen is so stupid it s obvious it s not all men 
Feminism,1615670502,    ain t so bad I d hint your position to your friend That your only friends of convenience wouldn t hang out with them if you had any other options  amp you don t respect their bigoted world view They ll either change  amp you ll stay friends a bit longer or you ll just go seperate ways next year It s tough if you don t have any other friends but it s not really worth staying in an unproductive relationship for fear of being alone I mean not saying you shouldn t fear being alone but you can t just be hanging out with someone you have no respect for to avoid being alone I d say just spend the year getting shit done then disappear in

Feminism,1615667331,That s what I try to tell myself but honestly I think she s just a bad person She s so racist that she refused to see me for weeks after going to a BLM protest because I was apparently around  dirty people that are more likely to have covid And same with that she s so solid with that belief she sees nothing wrong in it and doesn t even try to listen to alternative views
Feminism,1615667166,Honestly I ve had plans to cut her off for a while but she s currently pretty much my only friend If I had more people in my life then she d be long gone because she s just so incredibly entitled in her view of the world I m going to university in     so my plan is to  drift from her then as I ll be moving away
Feminism,1615666556,One man with the wrong intentions is enough men to be afraid Well put 
Feminism,1615666526,Once I argued with my mom about how woman should be prepared with enough self defense to everything evertime and she labeled me as a misogynist And I feel so foolish and wrong about my past self And I despise even the people who inherits same opinion as my past self but I despise even more the people are sexist and blaming victims  Just remind your sexist friend that there are people out there who is ready to go rape or murder but they just cant do in public because of laws and afraid of being caught more than doing it and this is not okay or normal either We are not in a jungle with wild animals anymore so why we should fear to go outside at night Even I can be anxious when I am the last alone passenger at night even though Im very tall I avoid to follow woman or passing her without even getting near to not to make her afraid because she can think Im stalking To just emphatise I think about what peoples worst act on every possible situation if I were woman because its what society expects to do for woman but its just terryfiening 
Feminism,1615666057,No its not all men But we don t know which men 
Feminism,1615665869,There are an abundance of scientific studies that have been carried out confirming that there is a difference between  men and women regarding what stimuli sexualy arouses them    Do you have evidence to back up what you re claiming   Can you like me some studies please

Feminism,1615663657,Toxic masculinity plays a role alot of comments on Facebook telling men to man up and protect women miss the point entirely Misogyny is so common I hear it all the time Its because something questions their pride or masculinity and makes them violent I think early education is key to make men less misogynist transphobic and homophobic

Feminism,1615716957,I think you coming in to comment on a literal  not all men post about how you feel as poorly treated as a marginalized group of people  who again let me remind you were sprayed with high pressure fire hoses for asking for equal rights in some of their lifetimes because a woman called men around you not perfect on the  feminism subreddit speaks volumes to your perceived victimhood Like you realize the  enough men OP was talking about are rapists and murderers and you re in here like  awh they aren t so bad you shouldn t be that upset by it  Rape is shit and people who stick up for rapists are shit by extension even if it s passively and through whattaboutism 
Feminism,1615716627,I doubt anything you or your man bun profit could say would sink in any deeper than what I witnessed as a child I also doubt you or him have done as much real work helping actual victims of abuse  But don t let that stop you from responding with more condescending crap 
Feminism,1615715604,Since it is a feminist forum I am just reading and listening and learning 
Feminism,1615714825,Because it doesn t suit your narrative of victimhood not because it s innacurate 
Feminism,1615714516,Black people are currently oppressed by our government men usually do and have done the oppressing of women Literally not the same thing Deflection much 
Feminism,1615714290,I am guessing that it might sink in with you if you hear it from a man  Listen to what Chris Hemmings says about  Not All Men   The dude goes into schools and helps young boys to understand so it should help you too   Link  
Feminism,1615714130,I dunno mate   which parts don t you agree with That black people are marginalized based on their skin colour in a society that in their lifetime turned high pressure hoses on them for asking for equal rights That men are treated better by a society that has been set up to favor them for hundreds of years That comparing the two groups as being equally marginalized is as abhorrent and privelaged as it gets Every time a dude does this kind of shit a Ben Shapiro gets his wings 
Feminism,1615713751,No I just want you to tell me how those two statements aren t equally abhorrent  You know if you can take time away from your empty self righteous posturing

Feminism,1615712908,I did read it It was full of completely unfounded and totally inaccurate slander  And nothing more 
Feminism,1615712767,Lovely  More ad hominems  How many hours have you volunteered rehabbing homes for transitional housing for victims of domestic abuse 
Feminism,1615712633,It s a difficult one though The overwhelming majority of men aren t doing stuff like this and to see all these posts generalising the actions of a few as the actions of all is not okay You wouldn t say not all Muslims are terrorists but a few are so we have to be careful of all of them  that s just racist   
Feminism,1615712442,Sounds like you re the one with the hurt feelings  You know nothing about me  Not a single one of your assumptions or accusations is even remotely true which is to say they d all be incredibly offensive if I were inclined to respond with an emotional tirade on par with yours Still nothing you said explains how those two statements aren t equally abhorrent

Feminism,1615711701,Lmao who gave this douche an award for his smooth brain take 
Feminism,1615710723,Black people are given poorer medical care have fewer rights are killed because of their skin colour have a very recent history of being literal slaves and their votes are suppressed by white people Yesterday was the anniversary of Breonna Taylor s death a woman shot dead in her home by white police who faced no consequences Men get treated better Men have more privelage higher wages more expectations of equality more opportunities less  not non existent but less expectations of physical and sexual violence against them less blame or consequences for physical and sexual violence to name a few differences Look at the fact that you just threw out a victim card the second you weren t considered perfect and better based on your gender while a woman was trying to make a point Poor me I m not considered better than for five minutes I d better insert my opinion to prove I actually am better than while comparing myself to a marginalized group of people for the pain I felt at not being considered perfect and special during this exchange And before you go there I m a hispanic guy I m just done seeing  not all men try to detract from women s movements because it means men have to stop being special for five fucking minutes so yeah all men Men are trash I am trash because I have to be associated with people like you who can t see women asking for attention and help without pulling out the victim card and saying  b but my feelings are huwt on every post where a woman feels like a second class citizen because she s treated like one Next time your feelings are hurt instead of posting try stepping outside of yourself for five minutes to answer the question why someone might feel a certain way about something if you can t immediately see it Chances are it s because they re being treated in a way you can t and don t have to imagine because of the privelage of being not treated that way so trying to detract from that with weird dogwhistles or whattabouting isn t going to improve the situation for anyone and you re just making an ass of yourself and the rest of  all men  
Feminism,1615708539,If they were so mad maybe they should start getting mad at the rapists and misogynists instead of the women being raped and treated poorly for their choice in words and maybe that s the whole fucking problem  a former  not all men douchebag
Feminism,1615707391, gt No it s not all men But we don t know which men How is that any different from   No it s not all blacks But we don t know which blacks  
Feminism,1615706373,If you aren t part of that  all men group then speak out and talk about the issues and crimes committed against women daily Excluding yourself from the problem will not make the problem go away  
Feminism,1615704985,And it bothers me when someone says  not all men since they are immediately pushing the attention away from the real issue just because they feel uncomfortable by a statement People seriously need to stop jumping to conclusions and think for a sec 
Feminism,1615704931,You brought a really good point because I get the impression that at least here in the West some people accept more easily this prejudice against Muslim which is abhorrent  I say this as a guy that also had a prejudice against Muslims and took some time to change myself   Returning to the topic I find the thinking of this topic kind of disturbing and even hopeless if you think that almost half of the world population is male and you perceive half of the world as a threat to your life you are doomed   This thinking is not only bad to the male but to the female too especially those who had traumatic experiences 
Feminism,1615704304,In that moment give her quite a bit of space Cross to the other side of the road if you like make it clear with your body language and gait that you re just a person trying to get from point A to point B and have zero interest in her  But if you want to help women feel safe you can also try to make the world a safer place Copying an older comment of mine    gt You can educate yourself I d start with the book Sexual Citizens    gt    gt You can get involved in local politics and advocate for more effective legal frameworks to fight abuse and assault    gt    gt You can donate and volunteer for nonprofits that provide resources for battered women    gt    gt You can call out sexist beliefs and behaviors in your friends and family    gt    gt You can as an everyday practice  be aware of how you might be impacting women      gt    gt You can teach your children especially boys about how to be effective allies    gt    gt These are all starting points for ongoing efforts It isn t something you can do for a day or a week and then declare victory Learn give and lift as you are able    gt    gt  Here s a discussion   on another subreddit that I think you will find informative 
Feminism,1615703625,Yes when you advocate for that kind of thinking you indirectly make it acceptable in other situations too Now progressive people will say that it s not the same when it s applied to a minority or oppressed group and rightfully so But the thing is we don t all agree who s the victim and who s the oppressor Both TERF and the superstraight nuts think they are oppressed by trans people Fascist believe jews are the oppressors and immigrants are invaders and so on If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor Surely no fash believe all jews control the media or whatever 
Feminism,1615703029,Yeah its a bit of a sticky situation because I know the intentions of it but it still hurts I am a muslim and it is as if someone would replace the word men with Muslim and with the controversy of hijab and burka ban s going around in Europe it just does not make sense to me Its so discriminatory
Feminism,1615702971,The language is illustrative that the generalization is already happening Rape and harassment is just that common of an experience that we first prepare ourselves for the worst It s normal if it makes you uncomfortable If you are ever walking in a dark street and there s a single woman she WILL be aware and take precaution  cross the street have her keys ready so she can drive off etc   If you invite a woman over to your house for the first time she WILL tell her friends your name  amp address just in case Her father and brothers WILL be worried when she starts dating you It s nothing against you I m sure you re a nice person but until she gets to know you there s a real risk for her 
Feminism,1615702479,Let me try to you all think about this point by just changing the subjects   Most of the crimes here are committed by black people I was robbed several times not even one of them were white or Asian or another thing then black and I m even black too my direct ancestry were slaves and indigenous   So I could say I don t know which blacks are criminals or no if I m walking alone and see a black male I ll presume that he is a criminal and take care       No its not all blacks But we don t know which one       One black man with the wrong intentions is enough men to be afraid Well put         I don t agree with this and I don t find this thinking fair I prefer to presume that all blacks are innocent and decent men just like me until they prove contrary

Feminism,1615698260, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action     
Feminism,1615697691,If you want to compare this to the race situation the true analog to the criticism of men would be the criticism of white people not of black people At least there people are starting to realize that we re talking about white people as a monolith and not every individual white person so we don t have hashtags like  NotAllWhitePeople floating around 
Feminism,1615695174,Women  We are fearful of men and with good reason  You  Well that s just hurtful What about men   
Feminism,1615694434,No because the proportion of men versus women who are rapists is much higher      percent  And rape is way more common than murder Most of us know a rape victim 
Feminism,1615693890,This problem can so easily be solved just by using a qualifier Say  some  or  too many  Anything It s literally that simple You know by this point that a lot of men  notice the qualifier take issue with being overgeneralised as rapists and misogynists so why can t you just done this one small thing to make them feel more comfortable 
Feminism,1615691013,Ive said this before didnt know she said it too Thats cool great actor too
Feminism,1615689484,Don t spread bullshit that s not true If you re sexist just say it 
Feminism,1615689219,Men are not saying that she should have been careful from my point of view From what i ve seen it s men getting told that they are the problem which is generalising and doesnt help the situation
Feminism,1615688654,I do believe it s all men All male humans are socially conditioned  whether they realize it or not to be ignorant of women s minority position in society and their passive or aggressive complicity to th issue 
Feminism,1615687276,basically the same thing as saying that all black people are killers because      of americans are black and      of americans who got arrested for murder in     were black  which makes it statistically  x as likely to kill someone if you re black 
Feminism,1615686021,A downvote No explanation or comments You are up your own asshole 
Feminism,1615684891,Because other  groups of people are much closer together  groups  meanwhile the   sexes group that accounts for nearly     of the humans on earth also seems to have the biggest difference between groups Testosterone and Estrogen create much much more differences in people than Italian and Chinese blood could ever  So naturally people are gonna lump them together until the day they die Doesn t mean all of the criticisms found by lumping people together just because they are M or F is bad But stopping there without understanding the full context of a human being and simply saying  boys are bad because they re men will always be circular and invalid logic 
Feminism,1615682314,You are the problem Far too fragile and far too prone to digging your own grave 
Feminism,1615740158,As a straight white male ally Atleast in the southern states I can say men do not hold men accountable That s personal experience but I stand by that statement 
Feminism,1615739896, Calling out   blaming Yes all men should be called out to do better because we can and we should  If you re doing everything you can that s great   Keep it up  And make sure to hold those around you accountable as well If you re doing everything you can then you shouldn t feel personally attacked by this  It s literally as simple as that 
Feminism,1615739759,Yes This tweet and many of the replies are broad brushing men 
Feminism,1615739588,Yes Some of us do This tweet is using a broad brush and I don t think that is helpful to affecting change 
Feminism,1615737847,Just listen When you do hear or notice something speak up And if you don t then just listen 
Feminism,1615737801,Nobody is blaming men as a collective here  I am a man if you think this is post is calling you out it s because you re part of the problem 
Feminism,1615736738,I m gonna go ahead and say the intervention part isn t true I had a friend who casually told me a story about how he basically sexually harassed a girl and when he was called out on it his only response was the get mad and defensive I m gonna go out on a limb and say most of the guys with these tendencies towards women will not react well when called out even by men This isn t to say it isn t men s jobs to call out toxic behavior just wondering how we can realistically correct it if the people perpetrating it don t want to hear it

Feminism,1615734147,It basically tribalism     people stick  up for those they feel empathy for whether they be men or women or animals I do agree though that women needn t be trusting of men who are strangers It s  simply not worth the risk So if this makes them unfriendly then so be it They needn t bother 
Feminism,1615733456, gt then why aren t all men helping women in ways that would lessen the violence women face That s my point The OP and many others like you demand that literally every single man act in a certain way That s absurd There are many ways to effect change and support without following your demands  gt Misandry does not even exist Yikes  gt I just know you re racist in the way you refer to black people as  blacks as well as stereotyping Muslims as terrorists Honestly I can see why you would say this because it does feel a little rough coming off the tongue But the verbiage has been very fluid over the recent years and there really isn t an accepted term yet People of color colored people black people blacks African American etc all offend someone for some reason Know that I acknowledge that but saying I m a racist because of that is a way to try and dehumanize me so you don t have to address my argument or simply ignore it as invalid The Muslim thing was also part of the point I m making Reading comprehension will tell you that I don t believe Muslims are terrorists The statement is terrible and very bigoted However I simply crafted it using the exact language of the original post to make a point This tweet OP basically says  all men are the problem in some way  How would that read about blacks whites Muslims women etc  etc 
Feminism,1615733421,It s  very counter productive to blame men as a collective Most intelligent decent people will not tolerate harassment 
Feminism,1615733207,Probably not  all       but  many  Feels like a some kind of competition or a revenge on men honestly To make such broad and stupid assumptions Maybe women should hang out with more men Feels absurd to read these threads as a man who doesn t witness that much harassment in social circles nightclubs or such environments And if it happens it has instant consequences

Feminism,1615730691,I ve seen it in my group of acquaintances  I m very deliberately not calling them  friends   Some of them are fairly decent when talking one on one and almosr none are ever outright shitty when talking in front of the girls but when it s only the boys around it s open season for all the misoginy body shaming and anti feminism imaginable  And the less shitty more reasonable among them are dragged along as well because you want to fit in On the other hand any criticism is met with open resistance from the ringleaders I ve distanced myself from them I ve come to the conclusion stopping them or reasoning with them is out of my reach and only further fuels their narrative I try to keep touch with the ones I consider my friends still to keep them grounded away from that extremism I m not saying this is always the case but it s heartbreaking seeing previously reasonable people radicalizing and being powerless to do anything

Feminism,1615726293,I think a big part of the problem is that the men who treat women like shit often group together and validate their behaviour within those groups I can t honestly say there are any guys I know who are or have been shitty to women  to my knowledge  And that s another part of the problem I don t know how my friends treat women when I m not around It s hard to call someone out on something if I have no idea what s going Best I can do is lead by example whenever there s an opportunity to do more than be passive and hope it s well received 
Feminism,1615725872,As a man with narcissistic tendencies myself who hopefully didn t cause any trauma or anguish but certainly was unstable in past relationships it s very common for me to want to publicly display somehow that I m  reformed and think people will see that and fully change their mind about me I personally have stopped myself every time and realized the moment I do that will be a complete disgrace to the movement and everything I ve learned from it  I have absolutely  sympathy for myself and others like this I just imagine this sort of thing is really common Just another opportunity for men to take over what belongs to women and expect credit and praise while not having to deal with the stakes of it

Feminism,1615725475,I agree still you have to consider that all this information is not reaching the people it is supposed to reach Some random teen encounters part of it gets into a twitter argument with a few trolls and then starts to think that feminism is about hating all men A possible ally is turned into a misinformed bystander and people on the fence are driven towards misogyny 
Feminism,1615725118,Hmm we do what we can to make it safe for the people  we care Unfortunately we can t stand up for everyone 
Feminism,1615724929,Oh have you decided to pretend you were joking because your insistence that your volunteer work makes you more knowledgeable about abuses committed against women than women themselves wasn t working Get the heck out of r Feminism You clearly are not a feminist 
Feminism,1615724699,Valid point but do all women do that too I can promise to you that I m more worried about the effect my mother will have on my niece than my brother
Feminism,1615723881,Sadly I think the answer is no not all men do stand up for women It s one thing to say you believe in equality and fair treatment and another thing entirely to call out your closest friends and family on harmful behaviour Personally I don t know of any other guys in my life who have actively stood up for women myself included if I m being honest 
Feminism,1615723815,I should be able to express whatever I want about my trauma publicly without being bullied and re traumatized If you don t support women healing in the ways they choose to I suggest you leave this group

Feminism,1615722678,Honestly you sound like a clown and have nothing but bad takes I ll fuck myself with whatever I d like and your shit brand of shock  humor is about as edgy as a sphere people have been using it since they invented language 
Feminism,1615722220,Yes abusive men are a problem  So is assuming all men are abusive  It was a crass utterly tasteless joke made out of frustration  Sue me 
Feminism,1615721827, the actual victims of abuse I ve worked with have acquired a pretty keen sense of  which men   If true then what you re saying is   women need to just sense which men are bad but also that women who do have this sense are not saved from abuse anyway With that solution being flawed shouldn t you agree that abusive men are the problem not women wary of abusive men 
Feminism,1615721422,Honestly you wouldn t be able to pass any screening I know of to be anywhere near victims of abuse  I m pretty sure the only one pretending here is you  Take your fake outrage and tie it inro a cute bun then fuck yourself with it 
Feminism,1615721176,Yep  It s a sad dynamic and it was a crass joke 
Feminism,1615720969,What the fuck are you talking about I never not one fucking time said anything about any of my feelings let alone the one you just invented  Nowhere do I say anything about feeling like I ve been treated poorly  What an absolute shit show of projection to cap off your entire thread of bullshit you made up and attribute to me I m sorry but I m done with you  If you really want to know my  story there s eleven years of my post history for you to peruse  Go back far enough and you ll find your  whattaboutism   And if when you get there kindly go fuck yourself preferably with one of those hoses you re seem fixated on 
Feminism,1615720427, gt Judging by the number of repeat clients it would seem  which is their type  This is pretty well researched in the field of psychology It s an aspect of trauma bonding a person within a traumatic relationship   abusive harassing sexual violence anything like that   will sometimes become dependent on the person abusing them Which can happen for however many reasons often gaslighting or simply not having a way out   it s safer to become dependent than to completely isolate yourself and to put yourself into a potentially more dangerous situation by leaving You can just google trauma bond if you want it explained in better terms Once the victim of this leaves the relationship however they ll often get into relationships with other abusive people Not because that s their  type   which is just a sickening thing to say honestly nobody goes out of their way to find abusive partners   but because the traits extant on their previous abusive partner that they  fell in love with will also be extant on new potential partners The trauma bond doesn t magically go away when you leave a relationship and if you became bonded to a person who was emotionally negligent and ignored your interests then its easy to become attached to another person who is also emotionally negligent because that s simply what love looks like in your traumatised experience It s also that abuse can decimate your self esteem So you leave one abusive relationship but can often feel like you deserved the abuse or at least don t deserve true love so you re willing to put up with other abusive relationships because at least then you re not alone with your own poor mental state

Feminism,1615753746,I like the idea behind the analogy but I feel it falls flat because the only real relationship we have with ticks is that they carry Lyme disease while men women relationships are very very complex and it can be alienating to suggest men don t care and or aren t doing anything about women s issues  I think what you mean to say is something like  not enough men  meaning not enough men are calling out abusers rapists etc because it doesn t affect them as much as it affects women This is a message I think  practically all men can get behind The disconnect comes from the fact that men as a whole need to do more but men as individuals feel absolutely powerless to change anything and it s demoralizing to treat men like they don t care on the whole

Feminism,1615747797,This this this Generally I fear men far more than I feel protected by them without a doubt They ve collectively traumatized us    
Feminism,1615746719,I don t personally think this is a man vs woman thing For instance I doubt many women have step up for a man when they see their wife belittling them in public Or that many daughters have discussions with their parents about the importance of men s emotional mental well being But that doesn t make all women coabusers  What s going on is called the bystander effect When you are taught cpr you are told that you can t just say  call     to a crowd No one will act You need to say  hey you in the white shirt call      The key is to transform it into a personal responsibility issue Otherwise people of both genders will just stand idly by and watch  So in general we need to create a better society with more empathy and personal responsibility We need to create people who will stand up and act against injustice when they see it whether it be related to sexism racism income inequality etc And we need both men and women doing that if we want things to change It s so so hard as people are wired to be risk adverse and not sacrifice themselves for others So rather than blast people for not standing up we should frame it in a way where we praise the people who do People like to be praised and get defensive in the face of criticism So I think with these types of issues you go with the carrot rather than the stick
Feminism,1615746338,I understand that sexism against women tends to happen more often than against men however if you are really looking for true equality surely you should still be asking the same question about women when there is sexism against men Both are a problem  Would just like to add though that I do still believe every point here is valid however it is unnecessarily targeted at one gender and I hope I don t have to point out that that is the sexism you claim to be against

admittedly the lack of used to be a huge problem within feminism and still is in large parts  It also doesn t bring up anything about how feminism has progressed the discussion about gender in academia something which I suspect is very undervalued In other words it focuses on specifically men s issues that are not related to sexuality race etc The intention is not to say feminism is equally about men as it is for women it does certainly focus on women and is completely fine doing so but the point is that the larger majority of the movement do care and that there is an expanding space within feminism that can and do talk about it Solving men s issues help women and vice versa  though my personal opinion is that it s most effective to do both  The goal is to give feminists an easy

Feminism,1615776292,This is something I have been trying to do   Honestly I catch myself mostly   It just reminds me that it takes continual effort to change 
Feminism,1615776061,Yup I get really pissed when I see an insta post that s like  girls guys   insert stereotype  like holy shit what s so hard about putting  some before it What s so hard about not generalizing
Feminism,1615775871,Yes and I feel as if over generalizing of people  amp groups is the cause of a lot of mis understood issues nowadays 
Feminism,1615775771,Exactly Said it on another post but gonna say it again because these posts keep popping up Not all men is used as a derailing tactic They know what they re doing The more you spell it out for them in posts like these the better their strategy is working We are teaching and wasting energy engaging with dumb arguments rather than actually discussing more pertinent issues Stop humouring them and let s get back to having actual fruitful discourse in the FEMINISM subreddit 
Feminism,1615775719, gt And who are responsible for constantly perpetuating those stereotypes Everyone is responsible not just men Come on this is basic feminist theory that you re getting wrong
Feminism,1615775440,That is a good point I think the problem with the post is it is singling out physical harm instead of just power in general Expanding it to power makes a better point but the tick analogy doesn t cover it very well then It s also is a bit too much of a blanket statement  But it s enough to keep us in a constant state of fear  This is saying that all women are always in fear because of the potential of physical harm from men  I guess the question is who is the target audience If it s meant to show people who don t understand what you explained it doesn t do a very good job You however summed up what it should have said very succinctly I think it s very easy to say men have many different types of power over women and almost all men have abused that power even if only minimally It s much more relatable and less polarizing Anyway I m new here and if I ve come off as ignorant please let me know I m here to try and be less ignorant 
Feminism,1615774979,I don t like generalization I see through the intentions of those people who rush to say  not all men to downplay women s problems But when a person says something bad and adds  all men to it then I really think that s wrong Isn t the point to just get rid of generalization entirely 
Feminism,1615774929,I think when people say  not all men they re trying to call out the fact that some people think  all men are fucking idiots and  all men can go die in a hole  Nobodies saying women should just stop worrying when they go outside in the dark and worry about being sexually assaulted 
Feminism,1615773659,Thank you for spreading awareness you honestly never know who you can reach with this message and how they can become inspired to make a change Here s to collective responsibility for improving women s safety  lt

Feminism,1615771680,I wish some of them had juuust this much self control
Feminism,1615770462,I just wanted to come here and say that men are not monsters we are humans U guys have created this narrative that men do all the wrong and women are absolutely blameless for their actions While  women dies at the hands of a bad person does not mean all men are responsible for his actions Young men die everyday and as a young man u have a higher chance of dying in the street then women We are not monster stop trying to demonize masculinity Its  women who died why don t we bring up all the wives that kill their husband s and get away wit it 
Feminism,1615770178,It s true that  notallwomen falsely accused men But do all women work to make sure their fellow women do not falsely accuse men Do they interrupt troubling language and behaviour in others Do they have conversations about mens safety consent with their daughters Are  allwomen interested in our safety 
Feminism,1615769706,The difference is about power dynamics and what the agenda is  When it comes to violence against females the group with less power is developing safety strategy based on frequent experiences so they don t continue to be harassed by those in power  The agenda is equality  In the case of refugees the group with more power is bullying the group with less power using isolated incidences as examples The agenda is political power  perhaps sprinkled with white supremacy  Essentially those in power should not abuse their power As a corollary it s vitally important we all recognize where we as individuals are in power and where we aren t A same person can be in different categories for different issues  eg a male refugee is in power as a male and not in power as a refugee We should help him out as a refugee but call him out if he mistreats his wife  
Feminism,1615768995,All people have a duty to work for the betterment and safety of others 
Feminism,1615768959,I think it would make a difference if we started to really acknowledge the mental health and substance abuse issues that contribute heavily to violence against women 
Feminism,1615768817,I mean I m sure there are men I would consider or at some point have considered friends who do those things but they don t do any of that around me I mean I m not really a man but most people only know me as one so maybe it s different for others but I think a lot of times men who do say and do this shit know who among their friends they can get away with being open about that with

Feminism,1615767435,Yeah not all men are abusers but enough are that its a problem
Feminism,1615766185, gt He will literally never do it again That s incorrect Is this anecdotal or just something you assume would happen if a guy was called out because that has NOT been my partners  m experience    When he s called guys out for bad behaviour he s been met with denial anger brushed off and laughed at ignored and very commonly gets ganged up on by other guys in the group who also feel attacked because they do say the same shit Any other time he gets along with these same guys really well just not when he s calling them out   My partner sells cars and deals with a lot of sexism and monogyny among the salesmen and mechanics An example of behaviour    Woman comes in to deal with the company for whatever reason mechanics get all excited and start elbowing each other encouraging each guy to try get a look even if it s to go into an area they normally aren t in talk about what they d do to her partner hears it and tells them their behaviour is gross and desperate they laugh and tell him to basically F off he s just emotional white knight SJW etc    Second example Partner was out of town for training along with another dude when they go out for dinner before returning their hotel Not long after partner learns this dude has a GF he sees him on Tinder trying to hook up with multiple girls for the ONE night they re staying there Partner calls him out gently saying  that s messed up     it s been a year and half now and this dude hates his guts still and tries to mess with him   Last example His friends he grew up with used the word  gay to express annoyance disgust boredom etc He decides to call his friend out on it one day friend thinks it s a joke and not serious keeps doing it multiple times until he realised partner is serious sort of stopped doing it for a while before going back to it because he  has gay friends who said it s ok so it s ok  Didn t have much to say when my partner responded back that both him and I are bi and my brother is trans and we re actually not ok with it It s toned down now but it hasn t  literally ever happened again like you want to believe    I m not attacking you or your ideal situation because how freaking great would it be if men DID just need one talking to by their mates before they changed their behaviour Sadly that s not realistic though It takes people a while to accept they might be wrong about their long term behaviour and longer to rewire the brain  especially the older the person is  I mean would you instantly change when    people never had an issue with your behaviour over   years but now one random friend is saying you re not actually the nice upstanding person everyone else said you were 
Feminism,1615765312,That s just blatantly wrong Nobody should be assaulted in anyway and yes women are victims dramatically more often but this type of comment does nothing to change anything    
Feminism,1615764330,I read it it s indeed a cohesive study But the solution in the conclusion doesn t put the blame on the idea of  false perception of female innocence but the fact that gender stereotypes put many of those men in positions where they are unable to identify their own abuse And who are responsible for constantly perpetuating those stereotypes     Gasp   Men did you shot yourselves in the foot and now you want to blame a statistic on women even when your own article concludes the problem is a male made issue unless you want to argue that somehow women were able to perpetuate those stereotypes 
Feminism,1615764053,Uhhh   because we don t care for being harassed assaulted raped murdered etc I know women am I right

Feminism,1615762194,I have a question so why do I always here women being scared of men when it s dark in the streets
Feminism,1615760803,standing up for women didn t stop me getting raped by one I don t understand these rhetorical statements of course not all men are interested in this as not all women are interested in treating other women or men as equal shitty people exist everywhere and it doesn t matter what gender they are 
Feminism,1615760616,says the person who cannot find any counter argument to change my mind of course I have other thing to do than speak with ppl that disagree with me but cannot find anything to change my mind good luck finding gender equality with such methods cause if you can t explain me how I m wrong when I m all ears of course I won t agree with you
Feminism,1615760040,Yes it is absolutely your responsibility to call out sexist comments and jokes towards women not doing anything about it leads to desentisization of sexual assault and rape therefore less likely to take sexual assault and rape seriously which is why women talk about their greviances men don t believe them In the UK    of young women      years old have sexual harassment it s not women s job to fix this it s a problem with men and it is our responsibility to flattern that percentage not taking reponsibility as you said makes you part of the problem
Feminism,1615759940,You re only showing your ignorance Since you re so insulted I m sure you will find something else to do 
Feminism,1615759843,says the person who is straight up insulting me  and no it was not useless I m showing my disagreement based on facts hoping people would be a little bit open minded but I guess insulting strangers is waaaaayyyy more useful
Feminism,1615759691,This is a really good start u LapisRS I wish more men would simply   ask  the way you re doing    You might also listen to the women around you when they complain about things men say or do Or ask those women about it giving them a safe space and making no comments when they answer you There are obvious things that men say and do that range from inappropriate to harmful but there are also things that may seem innocent but make a solid percentage of women feel uncomfortable or unsafe For example a while back I complained to an otherwise pretty forward thinking male friend about how hard it was to find a boyfriend to which he replied that maybe if I smiled more and let strangers approach me I d have a boyfriend Stuff like that 
Feminism,1615759428,And as a woman I can believe that because most men that I ve encountered have been very respectful to me 
Feminism,1615758532,  If you read and understood the comments you would know not to say something so monumentally useless 
Feminism,1615758500,Ok but men don t owe you protection Thats it thats why Do you jump to protect men No you don t 
Feminism,1615758351,ok so you re making the assumption that all men do these things and that s not true  I am an exemple at least no I read only the comments not the responses so I had a global idea of what feminists wanted to say and how they are thinking
Feminism,1615757346,or maybe you didn t find the right partner we all got our ways and there is probably one person there that like the same thing as you
Feminism,1615757343,Probably an unpopular opinion that will kill my karma but I m not sure that all men having a duty to be the protectors of women is feminism This reads more like   th century coverture 
Feminism,1615757265,the username is a pure joke don t use it as an argument and don t think you re smart cause you pointed it out  i m not saying you are

Feminism,1615781201,I wonder if we re due for this kind of discussion to remind us all why stereotypes are immoral and undesirable We all grew up being told not to stereotype whole groups based on individuals that prejudice is bad but a lot of us probably haven t spent much time weighing the pros and cons because it is just seen as an obviously awful thing to do full stop Then enough time goes by that someone can openly advocate the textbook definition of prejudice and there are some people who go  yeah you know what stereotypes are actually pretty useful I wonder why we ever stopped using them People are like ticks if enough are bad then it s ok to act as though they re all that way makes perfect sense

Feminism,1615780465, gt This is true though Whenever I am walking in the dark I  am always in a constant state of fear Even it s not dark and I need to walk past a group of men who are loitering there is a baseline fear always  My smart watch will show a sudden increase in heart rate  Ya I see what you mean there It s an odd dichotomy that men can both make women feel safe and also fear just by being present I was picturing walking with my wife This would make her feel more safe However I m sure she would still have some fear walking past a group of men even if I were with her Depending on the situation of course Plenty of food for thought there Idk I guess it was hard for me to identify with the core of what the post meant And then I see comments like some in this thread basically saying that if someone doesn t get it now they never will Well I didn t get it and you helped me understand I know there are people who fight against this and  not all men is a tactic I feel like at a glance it s a damn good tactic for someone who doesn t want to understand Someone who doesn t want to examine themselves gets a free pass because they aren t violent Now if they re not guilty why get introspective Anyway what I m trying to say is thanks for not being dismissive and taking the time to articulate the subject 
Feminism,1615780403,This argument would also work really well to support a lot of really heinous forms of bigotry like anti semitism as acceptable because  in the eyes of the anti Semite the Jews are the party in power and have the control Or poor white people and affirmative action or men going through family court Just because a group thinks they have less power than another group in a particular instance does not make stereotypes and sexism morally acceptable 
Feminism,1615780175,I just don t think so I owe no duty to you unless we enter into privity Also the post was sex specific It assumes either that women need men s protection or that men have a duty to women or both As a woman I don t need a man to take care of me As a feminist I believe in individualism and empowerment via personal responsibility 
Feminism,1615779407,If I did the same thing with the male reproductive organs this whole subreddit would go ape shit
Feminism,1615779365, when  in   women are only out for the money and the other  do nothing they all are out for the money  Wrong quote  Changed men women Changed shit money How is that quote even a aurgment I used the same aurgment with different nouns and verbs It could apply to so many different things and more clear as to why it as a aurgment basis Doesn t make sense So all drinkers are responsible for all drunk driving deaths  No it s only drinkers are responsible for drunk driving  The whole party isn t responsible for the lesser  of fucked up individuals 
Feminism,1615778730,Good idea for a comic and I agree in principle but this is cringe tbh As feminists we really need more affective talking points than complaining abt teenage boys who say  not all men  It s a fine talking point in spaces primarily for women but it s bringing no men over to our side unfortunately Talking about the  in  women and  in  men and other rape statistics I think is a much better way to converse about rape culture We  need better consent education regardless of assigned gender 
Feminism,1615777906,Oh absolutely I used men in my example because I see them get defensive more but you re right in that it occurs from both sexes quite frequently
Feminism,1615777830,Yeah i guess I was also talking about girls too I don t like it when anyone stereotypes generalizes either gender
Feminism,1615777690,Couldn t agree more Most of these arguments can be avoided by just saying   some men do  x  instead of  men do  x   Imagine actually being able to discuss a problematic behavior with someone because they don t feel personally attacked or accused    That being said the  some is often implied and simply not picked up on 
Feminism,1615777524,Yep this Exactly this See also  a few bad apples instead of understanding the huge underlying systemic issue and way too much injustice 
Feminism,1615777200,It s also similar to racist talking points  Replace the  men with any other group and it s really obvious 
Feminism,1615776949,All analogies are just proxies of the actual issues and they often remove the context My point was that comparing  different analogies doesn t always make sense because the context can be very different  ie power dynamics  I agree that for the same issue you may need different analogies to get the point across to different people In this graphic I am interpreting tick bites as an analogy for  all types of harm  physical  amp mental as verbal abuse is still abuse   gt This is saying that all women are always in fear because of the potential of physical harm from men This is true though Whenever I am walking in the dark I  am always in a constant state of fear Even it s not dark and I need to walk past a group of men who are loitering there is a baseline fear always  My smart watch will show a sudden increase in heart rate  
Feminism,1615797935,I think this thread sums it up Stereotypes and prejudice apology is the right wing approach The left wing one is that it s not men as individuals who are the target of criticism but social structures 
Feminism,1615797646,Some issues are very much gendered though and sexual violence is definitely one of them So yes everyone needs better education but this could be interpreted in a genderblind kind of way which would be a mistake  not that I think that s what you meant by this 
Feminism,1615797641,Someone called this sexist and the comment as well  Takes all sorts  
Feminism,1615796812,as I explained in a similar  thread    gt Now  progressive people will say that it s not the same when it s applied to  a minority or oppressed group and rightfully so But the thing is we  don t all agree who s the victim and who s the oppressor Both TERF and  the superstraight nuts think they are oppressed by trans people Fascist  believe jews are the oppressors and immigrants are invaders and so on  If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not  just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor Surely no fash  believe all jews control the media or whatever 
Feminism,1615795220,Aside from a few factual corrections  as far as I m aware men are punished more severely for all types of crime and are more at risk for violent crime although I could be wrong  I m curious as to why the distinction of privilege is significant in this case I acknowledge readily that racial minorities have been and are oppressed by white people as a class I acknowledge that women are oppressed by men as a class in some respects although unlike with race this relationship is much more fuzzy Nonetheless if I am determining whether or not to cross the street when I see someone of a certain racial or gendered characteristic coming why does it matter if the class the trait belongs to is the oppressive or oppressed group 
Feminism,1615794977,So would it be justified for me to distrust all poor looking people or racial minorities because similar statistics exist for their perpetration of crime or not Is it acceptable to judge individual people based on data about their social class if the price of trust is your own safety  I m asking this in good faith this isn t a  gotcha moment or anything 
Feminism,1615794745,I completely agree with this pic but man it s gonna be weird being a cop and still holding these opinions 
Feminism,1615794226,Ticks don t have feelings though Being innocent with to ill intention but being treated as such is unfair It s like saying all humans are murderers because some are 
Feminism,1615794063,Not the same thing  Cops are supposed to stop such things  If I see someone catcalling or discriminating a woman most of the time the best I can do I is voice my opinion Cops have the authority to stop other cops from doing illegal things 
Feminism,1615793897,No With  all men it s  too many men  With  all cops it s quite literally every single last cop because that s what the job is 
Feminism,1615792517,Except it is all cops The ones who do their job properly and follow the rules are still doing something immoral They re using violence to uphold an unjust social order on the behalf of the rich and powerful Even the nicest neighborhood beat cop is doing that
Feminism,1615792188,As a man I ve been bullied by other men for defending women in certain situations I honestly don t even wanna bring up some of the situation because they re extremely triggering  both for me and also women here but all I can say is be mindful of the way men treat women be mindful of how women feel in the moment and be mindful of the dangerous realities that women face every day 
Feminism,1615792106,I m so glad those pieces of shit conservatives got kicked out in WA Biggest loss in history apparently Now we need to get them out of the government and make them obsolete Can t believe people have been supporting rape enablers for this long When will people learn conservatives do not care 
Feminism,1615792105,People have different life experiences Remember that before you judge somebody
Feminism,1615792072,Listen to her point of view Understand where she s coming from I m a conservative and my best friend is really liberal and we are like brothers 
Feminism,1615791806,Comparing men to ticks is not a good way to win over people  The best way to refute  not all men is to point out that feminists aren t saying  all men are bad in the first place it s the men who are trying to discredit them by unfairly generalizing and trying to turn this into a purity test  bad men vs innocent good men  Feminists say that some men are actively bad many more are disengaged and unhelpful often going along with the bad guys and that more broadly there are broader forces like masculinity and gender roles which can t be discussed in terms of individual guilt and innocence 
Feminism,1615791507,   Damn you both have some great perspective here I couldn t agree more with everything you guys have said and I support women who think this but just because I saw this brought up somewhere else I thought I d help clear it up here    I should preface that I hate the argument that I m about to talk about its based on racist ignorance and doesnt take into effect the context of America s negative history    People  not just women have been trying to find a parallel to this point by arguing that they should similarly be more afraid of black men because they are more likely to commit crime in their area The difference between the arguments is the context that Black people have disproportionately been forced in poorer neighborhoods and been oppressed in the workforce Essentially the crime comes from living in poverty not being black  e g  a third variable  The context as you said seems to play a particularly large role in understanding these types of social points and the variables that cause the social distress Do you have any thoughts on this I would love to hear anyone s perspective on how this point is isn t relatable to the point about men because I ve been arguing with racist family on Facebook about this these last few days I sure could use more help because their sexism and racism is extremely stubborn and frustrating     A follow up point the argument used against men  may be most applicable for anyone scared to walk down the street in an impoverished area at night As a Brazilian American I always avoid going to certain areas of my city in Brazil because they have more crime These areas just happen to be the poorest areas I by no means hate poor people though similarly to how the argument against men doesn t mean that women hate all men There s just strong information that informs our actions to be careful in these social situations    Even though the point above and the point about women fearing men seems fundamentally the same there is a huge difference again it s context The situation with poverty can be changed much faster than the situation with men this is because of how the situation with poverty has been constructed differently If the government just heavily funds these poorer communities we can simply eradicate these criminal differences without the need for more policing which leads to more unnecessary death I don t give a shit if people think my idea is socialist BS  most Brazilian family hate me for thinking this way  they can suck my socialist butt The situation with men cannot be fixed that easily I hope that all made sense I m tired af writing two   page neuroscience research papers studying for exams and barely getting by financially Life honestly makes me so depressed and exhausted but you all make me feel more confident that we re moving in the right direction

Feminism,1615790789,listen and always be ready to attack when needed fellow white knight
Feminism,1615790637,Okay so the way I look at it is that rather than criticizing men focus criticism on male socialization behaviour So directing anger towards the systemic patriarchal structures that foster toxic male behaviour rather than the general male population That being said I want to clarify that when women make the decision to avoid be guarded around men it is not the same as prejudice Prejudice is hatred or discrimination based on affiliation with a  harmless group while being wary of men is based on the very real threat that they pose to women

Feminism,1615787139,The most powerful common act I ve seen men do to other men to keep them in check from abusing  amp threatening women is  the Look   I ve seen my son s and other men divert the mal intention of some men with the look that says  you ll have to move through me before I let you hurt her  If you aspire to be a  not all men man you ll have to challenge those  some men often with your eyes and be ready to back it up with the physical  I ve been around long enough to know that that is how the human race rolls  Do you have the buy in to fight for it

Feminism,1615784296, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action

Feminism,1615807007, gt Having ones victimhood challenged What do you mean by this 
Feminism,1615804720,This   This doesn t reference any particular group of people as being the source of the problem This was not an attack on men 
Feminism,1615803224,Gotta say if the feminist group wants more men then why not change the language from  men are rapists to  too many women are being raped  It s understood in both that it s mostly men who are raping women but the second one has a better chance of getting normal men to join the cause
Feminism,1615802737,Not sure if you read OP s question before it was but he specifically asked  how is this  it s not all men but we don t know which men different from saying not all black people but we don t know which black people  I provided examples on how it s not the same and how that felt like an obfuscation and a dogwhistle Comparing yourself to a maginalized and oppressed class when it s convenient to spin a narrative while ignoring the systematic injustices against said class versus the systematic advantages to another to smokescreen and counter an argument that men commit violent crimes against women and try to whattabout the argument into race baiting nonsense is really scummy to do on a board about women s issues and the amount of mental gymnastics required to say  you aren t allowed to talk about your safety or the danger men pose because it s akin to racism is absurd As to your point nobody is going to ask whether or not crossing the street to avoid a man is racist if that man is black versus white except for people fixated on that person s race so your scenario is a bit confusing Are you implying a woman who won t cross the street to avoid white men but will cross the street to avoid black men and women Yes that s racist  If a woman crosses the street to avoid a man regardless of race she s doing what society expects of her to  keep herself safe as it always comes back to when a woman is harmed  She should have been more aware of her surroundings she should have dressed differently she should have crossed the street when she saw someone approaching her she should have blah blah blah and other ways it s not the man s fault for harming her but her own fault for existing But then people want to say  not all men  despite it being a woman s fault for not suspecting it could be all men It s an absurd circular argument that could go round and round forever and everyone is tired of hearing it So to me and a lot of other people it s all men and that s not an issue of privelage or class it s a societal mandate issued by the government who refuses to prosecute men for their behaviors and teach women how to be afraid rather than teach men not to be abusers Women must keep themselves safe because the answer from policing and government agencies when they don t is  she should have suspected all men and acted in accordance with that

Feminism,1615801609,Having ones victimhood challenged because men feel embarrassed guilty seems more unfair No women or feminist are saying all men are murderers Like all metaphors it doesnt explore the whole picture  but it adequately explains the concept that male violence and the risk men pose to women can be real without it affecting all women and all men 
Feminism,1615800899,I think the analogy is really powerful At first I thought it was dehumanizing but on second thought I realized it really wasn t it wasn t blaming men or comparing men for ticks it was just explaining the mindset of women who suffered through interactions with toxic and predatory men BUT it s so hard to realize it sometimes I understand that it s not a real comparison but It s kind of triggering to think you re being compared to bugs given that dehumanizing campaigns around the world have compared other groups to insects

Feminism,1615838879,He really is this is literally his one flaw He has reasons with it though He s protective because past girlfriends have seriously hurt him and have done awful things to him He had a girlfriend who would rub it in his face that she would stay up late face timing other guys He has trust issues and believes more risqu clothes should be reserved for only intimate partners I agree partly but I also think people should wear whatever they want as long as it isn t straight up nudity

Feminism,1615838105,One thing you can do is share articles and studies about sexual violence and aggression on social media  be willing to put your face and name behind these issues and amplify women s voices  Be conscious of the language you use and that is used around you when talking about issues that disproportionately affect women Always be willing to learn Know when to shut it and listen Use your voice to amplify women s voices and call out harmful ones  When you consistently behave like an ally women will become more comfortable telling you about their experiences and you may end up learning some surprising things about men you always thought were decent Be prepared to learn those things and considerate of how you respond to what women tell you  Be willing to lose friends over their treatment of women

Feminism,1615833496, gt you tell him they buddy I don t accept that kind of behaviour He will literally never do it again the shame to lose face in front of another man I take your point that men who abuse women are generally more concerned about their reputation among men than what any woman thinks of them e g a lot of rape culture is about focusing more on notches on bed posts and establishing an identity as a guy who can  score  than focusing on whether she really wanted to  I am afraid this isn t such a silver bullet though Maybe I ve gone about it wrong but it feels like I m just as likely to be accused of something along the lines of  white knighting  It sucks I still feel like it s my responsibility to speak up and I ve long since given up on wanting to  fit in with such crowds but that just makes me more of an outsider to them It s a hard problem 
Feminism,1615828811,Well yes I don t think everyone is going to     agree on whether a particular group is a minority   gt If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor I think this is a slippery slope fallacy and not quite true We should always qualify whether a group is a minority based on statistics shared experiences and common sense I don t think every claim at being a minority should be validated but some will be If when we a consensus on the qualification the logic still applies

Feminism,1615822413,I see what you re saying but the statistics do demonstrate that      of rapists are men while there are no statistics to demonstrate that nearly all thieves are black people or that nearly all child molesters are gay If we knew that      of child molesters were from a certain group  orientation race  of course we would keep kids away from that group And even if that rape statistic didn t exist if a woman has had numerous experiences with violence harassment from men and so have all her friends I think that s enough evidence of danger to justify that  prejudice  
Feminism,1615821402,It s a tricky subject because you re absolutely right that women are just protecting themselves from a very real potential threat but when it is advocated so broadly as it is here it feels like trying to carve out an exception just for one circumstance When THEY do it it s prejudice When WE do it it s just protecting ourselves What about people who cross the street or clutch their purse around black people or refuse to trust their money to financial advisors based on their ethnicity or protect their children by not allowing them to be around gay people They all think they re just guarding themselves from a very real threat The only argument you could make to those people is to say  No no but my stereotype is true I m right about this group over here you re just mistaken about THAT group being bad  Your point about focusing on behavior and social structures is dead on well put

Feminism,1615863034,You mentioned that you don t blame guys for this because they grew up with that Implying that boys grow up thinking a certain way  amp I feel like you giving it a negative connotation In you negative experience with someone flirting with you I don t know how pushy the guy was so I can t judge you on your personal experience but if you handled it with an aggressive matter that it didn t match the guys approach then I would consider it fiesty as well But considering you were underage he s a dumbass When it comes to jokes it just depends how much you take it personally I ve had people roast me  amp talk shit but I dont care at the end of the day because their words don t affect me  I don t let it get to me No matter what it is But that s me it just depends how vulnerable you are to things like that I mean if someone has an opinion of you being  feisty it WAY DIFFERENT FROM  ALL MEN SHOULD DIE   Those are two completely different scenarios one of them could possibly potentially dangerous Saying all men should die is threatening it could signal that the person could have a mental illness I mean most hate crimes occur off such word like that  Calling someone  fiesty is not even close to ALL MEN SHOULD DIE  Quite an extreme example Hoodies sweatpants  amp sandals are quite extreme tbh but it doesn t mean that there still ain t some sort of parameter that both females  amp males should follow I mean at the end of the day he s a man Men are attractive to women SURPRISE Obviously if he sees a model on ig he s going to naturally be attracted to it Of course if he s a heterosexual or bi You can t blame him for admiring female beauty But see the difference is models are paid to do their job  amp there job is to look  attractive  I bet that he wouldn t marry someone like that tho because men are very selective with whom they want to be with for the rest of their life So that s where the whole women should act like ladies comes into play Because if your not a model you shouldn t be so explicit That s goes for both men  amp women I mean many men are upset of this feminist movement where they feel like they are being generalized as something they aren t I mean having women generalize that men are rapists violators  amp sex offenders does hurt men to hear because not all of us participate in that horrendous behavior Many of us do put a stop to it  amp call it out even if its with the  boys  Guys know when guys are being assholes some of us do control  amp tell the homies to back off So when you got people coming at you or your type of people it hurts It does affect our gender to have to deal with such harsh claims

Feminism,1615859711,Right I agree with most of what you said except for   gt Capitalism may be part of it but non veganism is the real issue You basically answered it below that sentence the only way you get to decommodifying animals and liberating the exploited whether animal or human is by first collapsing capitalism If everyone became Vegan there d still be very poor treatment of animals regardless because of industries that use animals for products however if capitalism falls we are able to start a transition to decommodifying products and necessities if you want to go further we can move to growing meat in labs we have already done it but capitalism prevents us from actually making it something to sell on the market This way you have a transition to a free er and more ethical society

Feminism,1615852984,Yes but in the context of the discussion I think more men would be willing to acknowledge systemic violence against women if those issues were also acknowledged  I think many men see statistics on abuse etc and think of it as something they would never do which in their mind diminishes the severity Educating people about why violence against women is still so widespread can help change their perspective 
Feminism,1615849489,You know mental health issues and substance abuse contribute to violence against everyone 
Feminism,1615848842,I know right he s always complaining about how short girls skirts and shorts are dude WHO DO YOU THINK ARE MAKING THOSE CLOTHES I think it s pretty clear women don t have any input when companies are producing those clothes It s all men He complains about it but loves seeing girls wearing that stuff  Like make up your mind

Feminism,1615848361,I define sexual exploitation roughly as using another sentient being for their sexuality reproductive system or sexual capacity in some way whether by overt or subtle force  One need not actually derive pleasure sexually from the exploitation that they are forcing on someone else  e g farmers in the dairy industry do not necessarily get pleasure from it but they still do it  That definition can be refined but I am referring to essentially the ideal of viewing the sentient being as an object and specifically a sexual one What I mean by women betraying other women women who would themselves be at risk of the suffering I am referring to but still choose patriarchy over doing the right thing Women who do FGM Women  and everyone  who aren t vegan Women who traffick other women  or men or children or whoever is being trafficked  Women who join in on misogyny when they are around male friends   amp  x   B I am not referring to someone sexualizing themselves but that may be a part of it Mainly I was referring to the systemic exploitation of women and especially female animals Capitalism may be a part of it but non veganism is the real issue The solution is a paradigm shift in which women are viewed as legal persons and not as objects and a world in which animals have legal personhood and are not used as commodities in any way 
Feminism,1615848231,He literally doesn t do shit He doesn t care Conservatives need to be make obsolete in Australia or else we will be going around in circles 
Feminism,1615847930,I agree with everything here however I have some questions What do you mean by sexual exploitation What do you mean by women betraying other women In my mind I know what sexual exploitation is being forced convinced that doing something you re uncomfortable with sexually because it s  empowering  however I think there s a difference between someone choosing to sexualise themselves and someone who s actively being forced or persuaded into objectification  With that said I think the only way to solve everything you mentioned is to abolish capitalism once that falls you ll see other oppressive entities falling as well with the rise of socialism 
Feminism,1615847024,We need a name for them that sticks like gorilla glue You need to stigmatize that behavior 
Feminism,1615844417,The main reason that  is used is when generalizing statements are applied to men eg   men are killing women  Although the intent of the writer is probably to say  some too many men are killing women  without that modifier in front the true meaning of the statement is that  men in general are killing women I think that men have a right to defend themselves from statements like the one above that generalize the entire gender Generalizing statements are not really fair when applied to anyone and usually result in unnecessary prejudice and judgement   Not all     are       but enough of them are  is not really a good rebuttal in my opinion You cannot justify generalizations about groups of people just because they may be accurate in some cases Try filling in those blanks with any other identity group besides men and it becomes clear why men respond defensively If a muslim hears    Not all muslims are wife beaters but enough of them are  used as justification in order to group them in with wife beaters they will defend themselves from that prejudicial generalization 
Feminism,1615843216,No it isn t too many More than    of men have never done anything like that You keep defining them by their gender instead of their actions Call them bullies catcallers and rapists but stop generalizing a population of over  billion based on the actions of less than    of it If you want to define criminals by their gender no woman should ever be fit to be a parent because the majority of child homicides and child abuse is done by women But when it comes to them you rightfully call them abusers and murderers instead of generalizing them by their gender Give us the same courtesy

Feminism,1615841754,If he is generally a kind supportive partner then I d be inclined to assume this is just a bit of a blind spot for him and a very clumsy attempt to make you feel less scared  My fiance is a good listener and tends not to give unsolicited opinions on stuff but he has his blind spots and he can be pretty useless emotionally sometimes lol  The important thing I ve found is to just tell him when what he is doing  or not doing isn t hitting the mark For example he tends to just want space when he is stressed out or emotional so his tendency is to give me space  ie basically ignore me when I m emotional  At first I found that incredibly hurtful but over time we both learned that we just have different knee jerk approaches to things so we need to ask for what we want Now when I m emotional or upset and I want to be comforted I just tell him that   I m really upset right now and I want you to listen to me and comfort me  It sounds so ridiculous but it works and he does a great job And when he needs space and I m all up in his business trying to get him to tell me all his feelings he asks me to please just let him do his thing In your case I d suggest you tell him that the way he responded made you feel dismissed and that you want him to be more open to listening to your perspective on issues that affect you as a woman like being afraid to walk alone at night See how he responds to that If he gets defensive call him out on it and bring the focus back to you just trying to be heard and have your emotional needs met 
Feminism,1615841712,This is what I always think whenever NotAllMen stuff comes up These men act like rape is the only issue we care about and that it exists in a vacuum Rape is propped up and encouraged by the things listed in this tweet  it exists within the context of rape culture which exists within the context of patriarchy This is a system that we are all apart of and we have all perpetuated at some point in our lives Solutions come from admitting our faults and working to change the system  not drowning out conversation by shouting about how good and innocent we are

Feminism,1615880706,Because gender and the power imbalance between the genders are intrinsic to violence against women and the reason it is allowed to continue  Terrorism is not intrinsic to islam  its intrinsic to extremist ideals and various other factors   If you dont see that but would rather get upset that we have to share the responsibility of the benefits we receive from a patriarchal society that calls women hysterical when they report abuse refuse to prosecute men because her word isnt enough and then imprison them when they act in self defence I m afraid there is little point in this discussion

Feminism,1615868858,So if I m understanding the question Should people be more afraid in a financially poor high crime area I think we can disregard race but obviously people will use that as an excuse to single people out Violent crime is clearly one of symptoms of poverty but it isn t a limiting factor You don t need to be poor to have power and abuse it I think maybe violence is the most accessable form of power So in a poor community violence or at least the threat of it is a quick and easy way to have power where you otherwise have very little Of course you have the flip side where the powerful can use violence simply because they have power I think the relationship is all other things being equal  which they are not  most men have the availability to exerte power over most women in the form of and threat of violence Maybe poor communities are the same in that regard The greater potential for violence is baked into the society if you will  And well not all fear is rational We are certainly all afraid of things that will do us no harm We are also unafraid of things that can or will do us harm But the the perceived potential causes very real fear Sometimes that fear is rooted in bad things like racism Anyway don t listen to me too much I ve written and this about four times now My points feel week and I m not even sure I know what I m saying But you put some time and effort into your post and I wanted to reciprocate Hopefully this is far enough down in an old enough post no one else will ever read it

Feminism,1615917383,Honestly is not that much different from any other form of fiction Japan has never been specially on the vanguard of feminism equality and many animes are at its core the product of just one person s mind which can be flawed and I believe the majority are men There s also the clich and vicious circle of being written for male audiences which alienates female audiences which in turn feeds the male audience excuses I believe it ll get better as every other media has 
Feminism,1615916098,Actually you re right Thanks for understanding my point as well I was just thinking that since not everyone would actively help someone who gets assaulted by which I mean that if it happens on the street the big majority of people would just turn their backs it s a pretty relevant thing if they actually call the police or help in any other way  But yeah there are also cases in which it s only the bare minimum such as like you said speaking up against racism or correcting a friend for rude jokes

Feminism,1615915316,Or make a nonsense naturalist argument and make silly comparisons to animals  like chimps where males are supreme you know how like people   th century justified colonialism and slavery 
Feminism,1615910985,I agree in some ways and not in others First of all everyone going vegan would result in animal exploitation industries to collapse and move to other alternatives since no one is paying for their services And if a tipping point is reached and not everyone is vegan they may be toppled sooner Whether or not capitalism is also toppled may be irrelevant and even if capitalism is toppled that does not mean that the world will be vegan Most anti capitalists are not vegan and and most discussions about capitalism are done by people currently using animals as resources They are willing to give up capitalism but if asked no way would they give up their animal products The underlying beliefs that animals should be used as resources for food clothing food and experimentation is not necessarily a capitalist idea but rather an imperialist and colonial idea that others should be slaves  might is right  capitalism comes later  Therefore we need to get rid of the underlying speciesist belief first and anti capitalism cannot be divorced from that AOC is against capitalism and she s not advocating veganism as a moral baseline Bernie Sanders is against capitalism but no way would he give up  his animal products

Feminism,1615981271,First of all most developing countries in the world sustain themselves off of vegan staples such as beans rice legumes grains Meat and dairy is a luxury Of course there are some people who simply cannot access any good food at all but that s not a why veganism is flawed argument that s just another way in which our global food system is injust  to animals and to humans clearly  As well we currently have enough food to feed   billion people but we choose to use those crops to fatten up animals whom we then murder  turning them into products that go primarily to well off individuals in the west If we care about the fair distribution of foods globally veganism is the only coherent option Can you go vegan Are you vegan Often people point out someone else s disadvantage as a way to say  well that person over there is disabled poor etc and they can t go vegan therefore I am not going to go vegan  This is illogical and it s also selfish to use someone else s disadvantage to justify your own inaction I agree toppling capitalism would be beneficial but again it s an ideology of non veganism that is the primary issue I agree humans need to be liberated as well but that also translates to  We are humans who oppress and slaughter billions of animals and I refuse to liberate those animals until I have my own freedom  We can all choose to not oppress animals by being vegan and most people can go vegan  And if they can t go vegan there are things that are not related to their diet that they can do not go to circuses not buy pets unless they re adopting not buy fur and leather etc  And yes getting rid of speciesism is a huge step in the right direction because that would mean everyone or most of the world has gone vegan and therefore there simply isn t any demand for animal exploitation because everyone has declared  I am vegan I will not willfully participate in animal use and so all corporations and countries would be forced to change  of course it s more complicated  Again there aren t many anti capitalists who are vegan and those leading the political fight  Bernie AOC in the American case would not further veganism since it s not something they perosnally practise

Feminism,1615967649,It s called  hetero patriarchy  The vast majority of healthy population want a system based on social justice and that of course includes no abuse nor discrimination However a minority wants to keep privileges and for that it s critical to them to abuse the rest and avoid the logical rebellion  This is very hard to sell as such so the narrative works a lot better when it s sold as an abuse chain  So the   privileged class abuse the     but to a percentage      of that    there is giving the other half to abuse The first half are the men and the second are women To the men is told that to protect their privilege above women they must also protect the   privilege And most men bought it Of course that   also spike it with more stuff like nativism racial privilege etc   but the thing is it s really easy to give to each man a woman to abuse because the proportion is     It s not so easy to give to each male a racial slave So women abuse works very well Then the rest of the narrative it s just for filling in victim gaslighting extremism labeling to whoever points the reality intimidation to shut up and keep playing that impossible to win game etc

Feminism,1616874278, gt One of the interesting points not illustrated in this graph is that the amount of money an occupation pays is significantly related to the  of men in it Well of course it is it s an average of all jobs whether male or female dominated Of course summing this up will show that men make more because there are more fields dominantly men than there is women and the men in those positions are making more than the women in other fields of work How is that unfair   gt It s that work that is thought to be masculine is more inherently valued than work that s thought to be feminine These issues are certainly related but it s interesting to see how deeply the pay gap is integrated into the workforce Have you done any research into why the gender pay gap exists There s many more variables than just simply men make more Ive  worked in the trades with women who make the same as I do can t produce the same as I do but still are paid the same the same as men who can t necessarily produce the same There are many female dominated disciplines where women are paid very well the same as men sometimes more The pay gap is more complicated than just simply it s not equal men make more than women  Take nursing for example predominantly female paid very well not more or less than men in the field but based on their time in the field to a cap then raises with the rise of inflation the same as their peers Equally governed trades which are    dominated by men women are not paid less they are paid the same but you have to introduce more variables than just masculine vs feminine valued work to get a more conclusive depiction of why there is a   wage gap Search any countries occupational breakdown by gender and you ll see the clear divide of which gender fill jobs more than others and if you understand the major differences between men and women as a whole you ll know why the gap exists we are different in two such ways that s makes us choose certain careers But you also have to take into account simply this     do women want jobs in these fields that are dominantly men most cases no If it was the latter you would be forcing equality of outcome and I don t think anyone wants that in a world where many factors decide who gets a job and the opportunity Women who are firefighters when compared to men make the same amount of money or have the same opportunity to make the same money Not all women want to be firefighters you need to be a certain type of person to work in the field women aren t built for it the same as men biologically speaking they don t have the same muscle mass testosterone aggressiveness   but does that mean for the women who do work in those fields do they get paid less of course not  I just fail to see where your argument and frankly anyone else who doesn t see the clear divide of male dominated work that is more masculine being paid more Well of course because there are more men working in the field so naturally they will be paid more as a collective driving the average up    Is it so hard to believe that Childcare workers for example are predominantly women     and those women are in that position cause they want to be there or dental assistants which make up       How come more men aren t in that line of work I m sure Burly Lumberjack Bill wants to be a childcare worker    no he doesn t because he s aggressive by nature and women dominate those fields because they have more compassion and you don t want aggressive Bill playing around in your mouth There are      Carpenters in Ontario compared to      dental assistants Should the carpenters get paid more than the dental assistants in terms of job not by the determination of masculinity or femininity but danger of the job working in the elements Of course they should and it just so happens that it is a very labor intensive job would a large percentage of the female population do that job    no it takes masculine traits now whether you agree or not the fact is biologically it is a masculine job does that mean that females are inherently undervalued to perform such work No they choose not to do to such work There is an inherent difference when it comes to equality of outcome and equality of opportunity Misreading something that isn t fact and projecting it as something else is not understanding or educating yourself properly on the issue

Feminism,1615991768,My last sentence where I say my point is that it isn t necessarily from a lack of care is what I was trying to say You hear more people are dying and you think lack of healthcare services discrimination shitty doctors whatever but if the population is growing obviously the rates of death will go up too But on top of that people are getting sicker cases are getting worse so again not necessarily due to a failing healthcare system though in the US it s certainly a contributing factor 
Feminism,1615991328,There s only so many times I can hear acKsHuaLly    in one day 
Feminism,1615990989,I m all ears to hear your  well thought out position about how sexual assault and racism aren t bad 
Feminism,1615990887, gt For me I appreciate devil s advocate in a scenario where I don t know exactly where I stand but I want to press the person to explain more why their position is appealing But this often results in bad faith arguments because the person is arguing a position they don t hold often by claiming a position of authority that they don t actually possess It s much more honest imo to just say  I m not entirely sure on my position yet My concerns with your perspective is x y z  That sort of articulation is helpful in building the trust and respect you describe 
Feminism,1615990855,What do you think sexual assault is Also I m still waiting to hear the  racism is ok sometimes nuanced argument  And the  sexual assault is acceptable when argument  
Feminism,1615990712,How about devil s advocate as a tool to find a more nuanced position for yourself This must be expressed in a respectful way in a context of trust but surely in such a scenario it can be useful to express tropes  which possibly you are inconclusive on to a person in order to allow them to better explain a well thought position to someone less well thought 
Feminism,1615990565,The original tweet doesn t reference  rape is bad it says there can be no devil advocate position surrounding sexual assault or racism So that is to say that in no way is their nuance to be found in how every single person thinks about every aspect of both those concepts Obviously nonsense 
Feminism,1615990365,lol can t argue that i m not a white dude having theoretical discussions however the idea that a white male is not impacted by gender sexism and the discussion surrounding those concepts is total nonsense It s a shame that there are some who would wish to respond to those who take an interest in experience outwith their own as attempting to frustrate them purely because they defend the concept of an honest devil s advocate 
Feminism,1615990187,Right here     Completely and utterly disagree to      Without genuine trust and respect though it is true devil s advocate is useless in any scenario even more so in ones where the knowledge produced is used to oppress and subjugate as knowledge associated with race and gender often is     You asserted something to be devils advocate to the OP Then you backed off of it immediately proving that your first assertion was the  bad kind of devils advocate 
Feminism,1615989974,How have I abandoned the position My position is that devil s advocate CAN be useful Where have I abandoned that argument 
Feminism,1615989741,So    what s the alternate to  rape is bad   racism is bad  Do tell 
Feminism,1615989730,Your first comment completely disagree when discussing racism and sexual assault we  absolutely need someone to play devils advocate    Your second comment playing devils advocate can be beneficial in some scenarios but there s a nuance to it    Pick a lane friend 
Feminism,1615989366,So when you  play devil s advocate  you re quite literally repeating the status quo telling us stuff that we already know  because not only do we too live in this space and time and therefore comprehend the norms of this cultural and historical place but we also are actively thinking outside of that box which first requires us to know that box really really well And you re not so radically reinforcing that we should remain in that box  
Feminism,1615989327,Devil s advocate does not have to be a case of someone asserting themselves then abandoning a position but I agree there are many who do that For me I appreciate devil s advocate in a scenario where I don t know exactly where I stand but I want to press the person to explain more why their position is appealing For example as a kid at a Catholic school the anti abortion message was drummed in quite hard Abortion was something I struggled to take a coherent position on in which I was always comfortable but it was noticeable that the science led of my peers were pro choice To pick their brains without knowledge of biology it was necessary for me to say  It is impossible for you to define logically when is fine to abort and when is not if you ignore the point of conception as that line in order to access their knowledge of the reality of the development of the fetus in the early stages as basically a tiny clump of cells and not a living human being in a womb Without genuine trust and respect though it is true devil s advocate is useless in any scenario even more so in ones where the knowledge produced is used to oppress and subjugate as knowledge associated with race and gender often is 
Feminism,1615988852,No I don t believe these deaths include homicide I ve seen it anywhere from homicide  usually by husband bf lover being the cause of    of all pregnancy related deaths Heart disease being     But numbers may be different now 
Feminism,1615988441,Introducing alternative views sure   but to what end If it s about anticipating counterarguments or adding genuinely needed nuance that s fine but that s not really playing devil s advocate If it s  I m going to assert my intellectual superiority by arguing a position that I don t even hold or that I deny holding when challenged  that s insincere and counterproductive and can do real damage in an organizing context

Feminism,1617008334,  The level of skill makes it less interesting And obviously how competitive it is   It doesn t   Yes it is true It doesn t sell That consumer training argument says a lot about your self righteous views Why would you want to  train consumers  Who gets to decide how consumers are trained and who gets to train them Do you realise how ridiculous that sounds Nothing has been taught to consumers Consumers simply don t care about women s football because it sucks regardless of the gender It just sucks   If I was you I would leave nutrition and training to the experts That s a very far fetched argument   It s not how well they are doing comparing to the teams in the same league that dictates their pay It s how much they sell This is essential to understand if you want to have a grasp on why they re paid watched less

Feminism,1616977818,   Like point   it is watching an objective skill level of under   s boys playing which no one does   Women professional soccer teams play at a skill level less than that of under   s mens  proven many times just google womens national team vs under   s mens  So although comparably elite against each other for the consumer it is equivalent to watching under   boys playing which no one does    Women s sports can sell but it happens that most of the consumers of sport are men and therefore the women have to appeal to men  maybe there s an entire untapped female audience which could shift things   Examples of elite females selling at the same level of men are Ronda Rousey and Amanda Nunez Although comparatively rare they garner the exact same respect as men of the UFC because of how outstanding they are I think one other reason they are so successful is that their fights are on the same card as the men s fights and so the consumer  mostly male don t have to go searching specifically for their fights it s all under one roof Maybe women s football would do well if it was on the same day same stadium as the men s and with one ticket you could watch both  as is done with ufc    Interesting point but I don t have anything to add to it at this stage I would love to see it happen though    You can personally change this You and your friends can buy stadium tickets shirts etc etc  But it won t happen because like point  the consumers are mostly men Not      there are women much more interested in sports than some men but on average a  bloke is much more into the sports fandom

Feminism,1616971085,It s just so alien to me I know a girl who wanted nothing more than to pop out kids and get married the second she graduated school To me that is well    very limited and to my mind pathetic She s a nice girl and everything she married a childhood friend of mine and I see them every now and then at gatherings I m   now and she s about     They have  kids and as far as I am aware she has been nothing more than a stay at home mom all this time since finishing school No real jobs during that time Career what s that Just spends her time parenting though unsure what her quality of parenting is seeing as she had a kid when she was still essentially a kid herself  personally I don t think barely adults  essentially still children should be having children  At that age her brain isn t fully formed and she didn t have any wisdom or life lessons to impart  I m nice and friendly to her in person and all that but she s not  my people at all I disagree with her life decisions and I simply have nothing in common with her She isn t a deep person or an intellectual so I really have nothing to talk to her about as in my mind she is the epitome of  limited   And if I were to say any of that out loud to pretty much anyone I would be branded as a horrible person Oh well sorry that I think people shouldn t have kids until they have made something of themselves  have finances secure housing etc to support the kid and aren t still kids themselves If that s what a horrible person is then I wear that badge with pride

Feminism,1616952715,People previously had to use sick leave  or other forms of leave or some people may have had this in their collective agreement already in these circumstances The new law means that paid bereavement leave  of three days I think for miscarriage stillbirth is a legal entitlement for all workers ie a new additional form of leave guaranteed for everyone  Likely with exceptions eg part time workers may get it pro rated casual employees are very unlikely to get it
Feminism,1617039031,Yeah it would be easier now that some people pack their own straws the whole thing is terrifying
Feminism,1617038621,Yes I had this occur to me at a house party with my friend when I was    still below the legal age in my country  which is     but common to drink low  drinks at that age It was a small party with my main  friend group The  bartender tried to secretly add vodka from behind the damn curtain Luckily I saw and called him out

Feminism,1617036699,Your opinion does count but if you want to get it across effectively there are better ways to do it Also woman and men stay In abusive relationships for multiple reasons but it s mainly how there manipulated over time I don t think everyone can find themselves in such a situation but some people are more vulnerable to manipulation than others it s a lot to explain I d say research it a little listen to people s stories I only truly grasped it when someone close to me talked about there story 
Feminism,1617036464,I m afraid to get an answer for this but do you think woman can victim blame other women blaming male victims I can kinda see  
Feminism,1617036418,My opinion doesn t count Part of the problem Just because you have a cow doesn t mean you have milk The cow has to be fed You also have to physically milk her You don t buy it but it isn t free   All I know is to many holler about being a victim Get out of that situation Why are women attracted to men that abuse them Then stay with them 
Feminism,1617036312,Damn Athena is truly the perfect example of victim blaming Now that I think about it turning dudes into stone is kind of like a victim lashing out in an unhealthy way You know like isolating themselves or hurting themselves that s not good for them or others and the curse aspect could be viewed as society victim blaming forcing them to do these actions 
Feminism,1617035706,It s cool if you disagree with modern feminism but I just don t think this is how you should go about it Plus insulting people isn t how you get them to see your point of view plus your statement just comes off as pretty childish so no one would take your opinion into account 
Feminism,1617035251,Medusa used to be a human woman then Poseidon raped her in Athena s temple Athena then turned her into a monster for desecrating her temple making her a symbol for victim blaming After she got cursed one can read her as taking revenge on men trying to intrude where they don t belong Plus the snake hair and turning people to stone is just badass 
Feminism,1617035164,These men like natural until it comes down to body hair yellowing aging teeth facial hair crooked teeth All those things are natural but I can assure you people that make comments about makeup are the same ones who dislike all of those things on a female

Feminism,1617026408,I don t have anything to say about that jerk ass millitary man s attitude towards women and the general attitude of millitary organization against the participation of women in armed forces and their delusion that women lowers the quality  whatever that means  I am come from a country where history is witness to many legendary female warriors and queens who with their strategic brilliance defeated their enemies So I know that this quality argument is nothing but sham Here read this interesting piece about women from Cave man times   And show these to those who say women are inferior in terms of physical strength as compared to men I think hunting is seriously demanding activity from both mental and physical perspective and in those times unimaginably fatal So if women could do that at that time of scarcity and ruggedness I don t think there could be any problem in  employing them in military other than the aversion of stubborn higher ups who are all males just a blind guess and their unwillingness to evolve the millitary culture from their self proclaimed ruggedness  which is nothing more than toxicity disguised as Avenue of making you mentally strong Sorry for being a late replier

Feminism,1617019586,It s honestly so sad that they even have to create this It s so easy to not drug someone just keep your hands and stuffs to yourself 
Feminism,1617019013,Yes you absolutely right Countries which are developing and are underdeveloped need feminism more than anything And yeah we especially need to spread awareness about those I ll surely cover it in my upcoming blog Thank you for your advice it means a lot   
Feminism,1617018943,If you ll find a reference to the nail polish please share sounds amazing 
Feminism,1617018411,The biggest problem is that the most common date rape drug is stronger alcohol 
Feminism,1617018274,This is so annoying   like you re putting make up on to please him or any other random dude  I love your reaction 
Feminism,1617017889,As amazing as these ideas are I have found that these things tend to be difficult to afford and or access  Not to mention it once again puts the onus on women to check for date rape drugs rather than expecting men to be accountable and not do it  And it also speaks volumes that date rape drugs are somehow much easier to access  considering how often it happens than these straws nailpolish etc that test for it  Creating it is one thing and it s really great but making it accessible and affordable to more than just a select few is what needs to be achieved  And we also should work to make it harder to access date rape drugs and increase awareness in clubs bars concerts etc  to be aware of spiking and taking precautions to make sure cases are reduced and men who spike are held accountable not the women who failed to buy expensive straws and have it shipped from a foreign country and were therefore drugged 
Feminism,1617016575,I ve been hearing about these goddamn straws for long enough now  they aren t readily available at all I cannot find a link anywhere for purchase or anything beyond  women made a straw Great But where the fuck is it   If you want to help with date rapes then maybe make the products available  
Feminism,1617015489,I named two in the post you are replying to it s right up there
Feminism,1617074244, gt While they are related I think too many of these guys are completely capable of empathy James Fallon in the interview I linked above points out that there are a couple of different types of predators Some are capable of empathy He argues that those who are capable of understanding this are more evil than those who are not He also talks about different types of empathy  empathy with individuals vs empathy with entire groups vs cognitive empathy vs emotional empathy  It s an interesting listen 
Feminism,1617068521,Wouldn t the feeling of getting buzzed be enough to know that you should slow down Though I guess a lot of hear girls are inexperienced drinkers who go by drink count rather than actually monitoring how in control of their faculties they are 
Feminism,1617068335,While they are related I think too many of these guys are completely capable of empathy They just don t empathize with their victims They are selfish and don t see the consequences of their actions beyond that it will help them get what they want  And of course there are those who like the thrill of violence against women 
Feminism,1617065978,This article is terrible The headline is a blatant lie  cannot be found guilty of rape because the woman got drunk voluntarily beforehand this is absolutely not what the court said  The decision Wednesday overturned no it was not overturned it was remanded Please read the comments  here on r politics   for some fantastic information on what this all actually means  I do want to make clear that there is crappy stuff going on with this case and the laws but  it s not what this article is making it sound like 
Feminism,1617065221,Saw this info earlier My first thought was  if a predator specifically targets intoxicated individuals  wouldn t that carry a heavier charge because they are intentionally preying on the lesser mentally capable Does this apply if the attacker breaks into my house when I am intoxicated Or only if I am drunk in public  So basically best of luck if you get drunk and someone sexually assults you 
Feminism,1617063737,I have no idea but this guy s response is awful right As in he s the one getting all this love on tiktok  amp I m so confused Guys everywhere saying he s  spitting facts  Is he saying because we bare children it s ok to call women hoes when we ve had more than  partner 
Feminism,1617062121,It s a hate crime but perhaps we need to consider an effective legal framework for misogyny that stands on its own terms apart from the existing framework of hate crimes and hate speech A very good read on this  
Feminism,1617057220,I don t understand these things do happen to men why does she need support 
Feminism,1617054146,As a woman it is probably not your duty to be an activist I think it s on us men to fix this I understand you will feel bad for all the misogyny but don t feel bad because you think you re not a good enough feminist The only way a woman is not a good enough feminist is if she actively promotes the conservative lifestyle and norms of husband does work and wife makes food You are good enough as you are I think 
Feminism,1617053678,That is horrendous I m sorry your parents didn t have your back on that But I m glad to hear you learned it wasn t your fault 
Feminism,1617053239,The fact that you  have your mom on your side makes you a lot safer too you are less likely to be targeted than people with toxic and unprotective or even accusatory families I know I got targeted when i was very young because when i had a teacher inappropriately acting towards me and I turned to my parents for help  expecting they would talk to the school they said  what did you do to make that man think he can act like that around you  I didn t effing know I was    I know now what I did and that was nothing I did nothing to make that man think he could act like that around me But at the time I absorbed it and thought it was my fault and not understanding that is how things got bad later in life because I thought that behavior in men was normal 
Feminism,1617052827,I get that I have a vaguely creepy odd Walmart coworker who I keep an eye out for  he s kind of clingy without being attracted to me which is just weird to me and my mom even said to keep an eye out for him  When you let your guard down it might happen  whatever  it would be So I completely get the  I happens when you feel like you should be safe  I ve read enough stories on here about women suddenly getting their male friends attention such as after she had a break up to know that even my own male friends could become vile and untrustworthy
Feminism,1617052294,That s ok It s one of those things that if you are expecting it it s less likely to happen when it does happen is when you feel safe if that makes any sense  The end result being you never feel safe ever again so that s fun I m perpetually exhausted now even though I ve become a recluse 
Feminism,1617051355,Oh definitely but if I can purposefully cut off my intake of the most common date rape drug then all the better I m not dropping my guard though Edit Also I definitely didn t read past the first sentence I don t think I had my head on straight or was skimming the comments when I usually read all of a comment before responding my mistake if it sounded very out of place with the rest of your comment
Feminism,1617050523, I also like women with long hair  That makes them uncomfortable most of the time 
Feminism,1617048836,I can personally easily taste a diff between  and  shots even in a fruity drink Or even double But I definitely get the point haha
Feminism,1617046461,It s so rare to actually be drugged by those substances though it just makes a flashy headline Alcohol and more conventional street drugs are what s involved in the overwhelming majority of these kinds of rapes 
Feminism,1617045935,This would have happened even if there wasn t alcohol they were hunting
Feminism,1617045553,Both are valid takes rape isnt something that happens in a vaccum and there is usually some level of blame that can be placed on the rapists friends family and the community they were a part of etc for not preventing what happened or not alerting the authorities 
Feminism,1617044366,They re are definitely interesting modern interpretations of those stories that are feminist But given that most Greco Roman mythology was written by men in times when women had very few rights you probably won t find much thats feminist in its original intention To find genuinely pro woman mythology you might want to look at some spiritual traditions from less sexist societies 
Feminism,1617042628,This was the Minnesota Supreme Court not just a single judge 
Feminism,1617042526,This is just part of the reason I basically swore off alcohol before I even turned   
Feminism,1617042283,I am looking forward to this being overturned quickly and the judge publicly shamed 
Feminism,1617041027,I m sure you know plenty of women in your life who do not consider themselves feminists It s way easier to subscribe to the patriarchal narrative and blame the victim than to question popular thinking So yeah women can definitely blame female victims and they do One s gender does not absolve anyone from toxic behaviour of any kind

Feminism,1615631508,All she said was to redirect your questions to the sub that is meant for asking questions    They do that with everyone who posts questions that may need detailed nuanced answers You re making this way too deep and trying to make it seem like ppl are out to get you simply for being male Not the case
Feminism,1615631460,Wow didnt know about this sub but you people are legit crazy This is what feminism is about these days huh 
Feminism,1615629974, gt Are they just trying to excuse their misogyny by bring in  female privilege  Usually that s what it is  gt Would that not be equity  It would be equity to accommodate everyone It s oftem not anyone s fault for them not being incapable of meeting standard Some people train and try as hard as others but don t make the same progress some people aren t as strong or as fast as others and that s okay But we don t accommodate for people To use the example of wider hips a male who happened to have wider hips  they exist wouldn t get a shorter run time He makes the standard or he s kicked out  The organization is meant to be practical they say that  Uncle Sam says if you can t do   pushups you re not good enough to do your job and you re out  Meanwhile   pushups is enough to be good at your job if you re a female Many people see this as a double standard It literally is a double standard Most jobs in the military aren t directly combat related there s admin logistics mechanica etc etc Fitness requirements are mostly redundant for these roles anyways but either you re strong fit enough to do these jobs or you re not To say that men need to run  random ish number a   minute  mile run to be effective in battle and woman need to run a    mile run to be effective in battle is ridiculous Reality is the same for both  gt But muscle mass and running speed are not the only aspects of being a soldier and even if they were women have proven to be just as capable as men in those area If that were true then the military wouldn t have different sets of fitness standards for males and females The different standards exist to reflect biological realities and make sure the fitness tests are mostly fair  Infantry  combat arms do a lot of walking  sometimes    miles with heavy loads  well over  pp lbs of kit on top of their own weight  This is enough to cause fit men who exercise regularly to devolop lifelong knee back pain Most men can t do what the average infantry soldier does  Having talked to infantry soldiers a concern I ve seen  is that the standards for them change Whereas before if you couldn t complete one of the hikes in training you failed now you can fail  of the  so long as you pass the last one This change coincided closely with women being allowed to enlist as infantry  I support women in the armed forces and I also support having multiple fitness standards  though I think it should be by job and not by gender  Above is just thoughts I guess

Feminism,1615628928,Completely agree  gt I also think parental leave shouldn t be exclusive for biological parents and adoptive kids also deserve the right to have their parents around when they arrive at their new household The only exception I can see is for monoparental families Perhaps the total number of weeks should be the same  E g if in a family of two parents both get  months I think a single parent should receive    And a family with more than two parents should get   in total and see how they divide it 
Feminism,1615628580,How is it blatantly obvious  Because I m a man  I m sorry but I m just trying to use logic so we can have a decent definition of what actually is mansplaining You guys can have different point of views and I d be happy to have a nice discussion about them But I ve been nothing but rejected until now

Feminism,1615628325,Have I said that mansplaining is fake  No some men do believe that a woman is more likely to be wrong about things because of her gender I study psychology  almost got my master s degree  and I know for a fact that the differences between men a women are non existant regarding intelligence But I do think that some feminists are too quick at calling out mansplaining when they see a man trying to correct a woman I m a feminist too btw as I said it is part of my ideology that women are equal to men 
Feminism,1615628284,What s the changing shoes for I get the rest of them but that is new to me  Also I m told the key thing isn t combat effective
Feminism,1615627865,This guy   I d love a body switching movie where he has to be a woman and realize how wrong his beliefs truly are  People talk over MEN too Not every single woman in the history of ever has been right    So mansplaining is FAKE  yeah really got us there  
Feminism,1615627545,I don t understand because I m a man I can t argue with a woman about the characteristics of a concept that s targeting men   Look who s behaving differently because the person is of a different gender now 
Feminism,1615627112,Go on r askFeminists for asking questions to feminists This is a space where feminists come to talk to other feminists Check the rules of this sub 
Feminism,1615626668,So if a man has one information in mind and has confidence in it being true  without it being true and tries to correct another man on something related to that information he s just wrong but if he does the same to a woman it s sexist and it s mansplaining  Mansplaining should only be when a man thinks a woman is wrong  because she s a woman  and nothing else How is this mansplaining  
Feminism,1615626136,Yeah that s exactly the reason we do that That s why a woman could never ever do that That s why feminists aren t taken seriously btw    upvotes   the stupidity is hilarious 
Feminism,1615625544,Sweden has an explicitly feminist foreign policy actually Not     sure what it means or what out government does in practice that is in accordance with being feminist in our foreign policies but just pointing out a country that has done this 
Feminism,1615625135,boybungling   i thought this would be easier but that s all I ve got

Feminism,1615613317,Ah men always getting the wrong pronouns Also speaking of French gendering objects I remember in Y The Last Man when the main character said  French is for chauvinists because you change the  elles for  ils   Kinda like what happens with Spanish with  ellas and  ellos  Weird tangent but yeah 
Feminism,1615611430,Happened to me during a presentation in front of my   Game school class to present the game we were working on In French objects are gendered the word was  orb which was masculine and therefore used the appropriate pronouns Then a guy in my group thought it would be completely appropriate to cut me off in front of the class in order to correct me  It s actually a feminine pronoun  Teacher steps in googled it   And I was right How hard for him is it to wait until the end of the presentation to point out my mistake Or did he want to play  hero and put me down publicly Honestly this isn t even my first time being disrespected like this sadly   
Feminism,1615611257,The only problem with your entire post is this  gt This community should be a safe place for those who identify as women Why are you implying we are not 
Feminism,1615610438,Flip one noun and this whole rotten subreddit will lose their mind
Feminism,1615610028,Obligatory attempt to be banned from this shithole of a sub The abuse on dairy cows is not exclusive to female cows and should not be considered discrimination The male cows are not treated as females cows because they lack the natural bodily functions required to perform the same tasks and create the same resources Female cows are taken advantage of because of evolution not because of their gender If male cows could generate milk they would be taken advantage of the exact same amount It s not discrimination it s animal abuse Don t let feminism handle that issue let animal rights handle it 
Feminism,1615609761,The simplest way to explain it for visual learners is it s an experience confidence curve where at the start of doing something you have very high confidence but low skill because you don t know what you don t know Learned this shit on Vsauce I know I m an expert 
Feminism,1615660591,Your reasons are something only you truely know If something about those reasons gives you concern in your very heart of hearts  it would be smart to maks sure you know why you want it and that its a reason you can live with after the fact regardless of the outcome  Personally the only reason I don t get a boob lift or botox  well two reasons  I can t afford either  LOL and I m not sure I d be ok with myself if it didn t turn out as planned Sure  would be easier not wearing a bra  but are the risks worth the expense Yeah would love to have a few less wrinkles on my brow but ack  what if it hurts me instead of getting rid of the wrinkles  Hell  I really want lasik because I am so near sighted that I can t wear glasses It would be nice to be able to wear glasses Argh  but what if    Feminism or  the standard of beauty has nothing to do with my hesitations   
Feminism,1615658090,I am a zoologist and I will be at the zoo with my families kids because they love going to the zoo with me since I can tell them all about the animals anyways I get mansplained all the time while I am telling kids about different animals it s incredibly annoying  this is a Malayan Tapir it s the largest of the four main species of tapir and the only one located in     UM ACTUALLY THE PLACARD SAYS IT S THE ASIAN TAPIR IT S LOCATED IN ASIA     yes asian tapir is another name for the species   IT COMES FROM CHINA     it actually lives in malaysia or sumatra   NO IT S IN CHINA SEE ASIAN TAPIR  
Feminism,1615657837,Feminism is about women having options and opportunities free from the oppression and expectations based on the constructs gender Therefore feminism should support women equally whether they decide cosmetic plastic surgery is right for them or not Additionally feminism does not support the subjecting of women into a single paradigm of beauty which is often how plastic surgery is advertised to manipulate women The problem isn t women choosing to get cosmetic plastic surgery the problem is the system that bombards women to believing they are flawed and their beauty is their most valuable asset Furthermore there are many other factors that complicate the topic even further such as dangerous fake surgeons classism in beauty standards racism in beauty standards cultural appropriation rising through cosmetic procedures etc  Each woman makes their her own decisions and feminism supports that 
Feminism,1615656902,but does she know Pythagoras s theorem to the third decimal  s
Feminism,1615656113,One would think having control over your own personage in that way would be aligned with the feminist ideals I certainly don t judge anyone who has the guts to go through that much agony to feel better about themselves  I think many people believe others get elective plastic surgery in order to be more attractive That s just not true for all At the end of the day  being comfortable in your own skin is something we all want Good on them for making it happen 
Feminism,1615655370,I m not sure what you mean with  advocating for plastic surgery but I am of the opinion that everyone should be able to do whatever they want with their body  Of course there are several different motivations with not medically necessary plastic surgery and a lot of it seems to be linked to insecurity and or the male gaze  But I wouldn t ever judge someone for deciding to change something about themselves I see it as an act of autonomy and also not giving a fuck about people criticizing women for it 
Feminism,1615650690,You know almost all wars have started because of competition for resources not emotions right I m I don t have to   mansplain  anything to you because you re deliberately being disingenuous 
Feminism,1615650021,you re equating being hysterical with starting wars is kind of a stretch though right
Feminism,1615649264,Wow so you respond with more sexism Imagine if men walked around using a term like say  womandriving  using it to mock women who drive or park poorly This is actually a thing  it used be common to roll your eyes and say  woman driver when a woman drove poorly and you can still see Youtube videos mocking them That would be pretty annoying and sexist right Now imagine if someone complained about that term and someone responded with  If women would stop driving bad the term would stop being used  Sexism is wrong You are never going to win the struggle against sexism against women if you use sexism against men as your weapon You ll just perpetuate it 
Feminism,1615647802,If men would stop doing it the term would stop being used

Feminism,1615643856,It used to be known as  a little knowledge is dangerous  meaning that knowing a small amount about a subject can lead you to think you know more than if you have deep knowledge 
Feminism,1615642957,Everyone should be careful when out alone   no one can tell murderers thieves and kidnappers to stop their crimes but instead we can tell people to be careful to minimize the accruing of such crimes Stop throw it on genders and blame one over another that s a childish  and let s all takes responsibility both men and women to reduce the possibility of it happening more often 
Feminism,1615641750,All those comments    Let me explain it to you It is a well proven scientific fact that men will assume women to know way less about pretty much anything except child rearing clothing makeup    Archetypical fem things  This combined with the confidence that men are taught to have because they feel they are supposed to know everything Results in bad faith interpretation of things women say taking the weakest possible interpretation and trying to explain something to them that they already know But this works also in tandem with the Dunning Krueger effect where men don t know how little they know about a topic  E g feminism and they think So they confidently mensplain feminism to women with no idea what they are talking about Hence so many comments under this post 
Feminism,1615641087,My roommate told me the same story O o  She was already really good and was earning money with it and he had no idea what he was talking about 
Feminism,1615640543,Thank you for posting this Sad that Russia has such patriarchal values  though no country is perfect in that regard either  
Feminism,1615640016, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action     
Feminism,1615638756,Agreed Don t have time for shite just cut them off  amp spend time with people you re aligned with It s not  hiding in a liberal safe space  life is just too short to stay friends with someone you don t respect out of a vague sense of loyalty

Feminism,1615636142,We change into trainers to walk home so we can run if necessary  Keys may not actually be combat effective but a lot of weapons that we might think would be useful are illegal in many countries 
Feminism,1615635478,So I ll go over your comment point by point Me talking about my degree is to communicate that I know the research that prove that man who belittle do so because they are ignorant nothing more No no one owes me an explanation unless all they do is being rude which is the only kind of reaction I got here How am I questionning the lived reality of women  I certainly am not I was arguing about what is and what isn t mansplaining because this expression was inappropriatly used here imo  No feminist here has been open for discussion as soon as they determined I was a man questionning the nature of the concept of mansplaining  I m almost certain you re gonna learn little from this well you missed my point entirely so yeah not much to learn 
Feminism,1615634592,How can you assess that  feminists are too quickly to call out mansplaining  By your degree Don t you think others on here have degrees as well or what If you do  how the hell does that matter in this context   Completely missed the mark there Feminists are pretty open for discussion and good faith questions Imo They still don t owe you an explanation though  People are upset because you came here not to learn something or to grow but to question and discredit the lived reality of women  Because you are part of the targeted group and it automatically sends you into defensive mode  You arguing about instances where a man legitimately corrects a woman  all while being presented with a very clear example is exactly that That s what happening here and people see right through it  hence the downvotes  Here s what people like you often fail to understand It s not about you  Women don t care about your degree or whether you re a good person We re talking about a  system of oppression in which there s a bias against certain people in this case women  I m almost certain you ll gonna learn little from this but at least you can t argue how much your  critique has been dismissed  even though you re not entitled to a discussion  And maybe some more curious and open minded man will find this and understands a bit more about feminism and its talking points Have a good one 
Feminism,1615682179,Try reading what OP posted ten times Might help Read it aloud maybe  I don t fucking know what to tell you   Maybe if more people with your opinion instead focused their ire and frustration on the men who are letting down the side and less on the people who hold men accountable you might get somewhere eventually  You kind of sound a bit like the type of person who says all lives matter 
Feminism,1615681730,Yes and we will probably never agree I m okay with that but you didn t answer my question 
Feminism,1615681500,I m going to get down voted and called some names I m sure  Why is it not socially acceptable to lump all of ANY other group together but it s perfectly fine to lump most all men together  If I m right most people who will defend this meme would speak out against memes that generalize women  even if it doesn t say ALL women  When a meme or a post says  men are    it s labeling men in general Just like when something says  women are    or  all young people are    
Feminism,1615679858,I used to think ftw was  Fuck the world so I feel you Worked surprisingly well in place of the real meaning
Feminism,1615677550,I think you may have missunderstood my point because I didn t really present it well  I agree Not just on the internet but overall when you start arguments when you are emotional it is unlikely that anyone will leave the argument with a changed view I didn t defend emotional responces I just think that topic like this will easly get poeple to act defensive as something about them is being criticized 
Feminism,1615675820,I am arguing in good faith I am not being the least bit aggressive If you don t want to argue with me that s your right but my points stand 
Feminism,1615675159,no one of the rules is goo faith you are vary much not making any points in good faith and are being aggressive so I am not going to argue with you 
Feminism,1615673552,Gee didn t see that comment coming No I didn t  mansplain anything And your comment does nothing to refute my argument  I didn t refute the idea behind  mansplaining being sexist toward women either I said the term is sexist Please read my comment again 
Feminism,1615671198,Same as when trump implied Mexicans were all rapist s or when racists accuse all minorities of being criminals   It s obvious they don t mean everyone of them are all those things  Why don t people get it Not  notallmen is so stupid it s obvious it s not all men 
Feminism,1615670502,    ain t so bad I d hint your position to your friend That your only friends of convenience wouldn t hang out with them if you had any other options  amp you don t respect their bigoted world view They ll either change  amp you ll stay friends a bit longer or you ll just go seperate ways next year It s tough if you don t have any other friends but it s not really worth staying in an unproductive relationship for fear of being alone I mean not saying you shouldn t fear being alone but you can t just be hanging out with someone you have no respect for to avoid being alone I d say just spend the year getting shit done then disappear in

Feminism,1615667882,That chart is great ILMAO I would add you re a fucking moron to probably definitely stop talking Reddit is a good example of this syndrome 
Feminism,1615667405,Honestly she would ve been gone a very long time ago but she s pretty much my only friend at current I m moving away to university in     so I m planning to cut her off then at the absolute least
Feminism,1615667331,That s what I try to tell myself but honestly I think she s just a bad person She s so racist that she refused to see me for weeks after going to a BLM protest because I was apparently around  dirty people that are more likely to have covid And same with that she s so solid with that belief she sees nothing wrong in it and doesn t even try to listen to alternative views
Feminism,1615667166,Honestly I ve had plans to cut her off for a while but she s currently pretty much my only friend If I had more people in my life then she d be long gone because she s just so incredibly entitled in her view of the world I m going to university in     so my plan is to  drift from her then as I ll be moving away
Feminism,1615666556,One man with the wrong intentions is enough men to be afraid Well put 
Feminism,1615666526,Once I argued with my mom about how woman should be prepared with enough self defense to everything evertime and she labeled me as a misogynist And I feel so foolish and wrong about my past self And I despise even the people who inherits same opinion as my past self but I despise even more the people are sexist and blaming victims  Just remind your sexist friend that there are people out there who is ready to go rape or murder but they just cant do in public because of laws and afraid of being caught more than doing it and this is not okay or normal either We are not in a jungle with wild animals anymore so why we should fear to go outside at night Even I can be anxious when I am the last alone passenger at night even though Im very tall I avoid to follow woman or passing her without even getting near to not to make her afraid because she can think Im stalking To just emphatise I think about what peoples worst act on every possible situation if I were woman because its what society expects to do for woman but its just terryfiening 
Feminism,1615666057,No its not all men But we don t know which men 
Feminism,1615665869,There are an abundance of scientific studies that have been carried out confirming that there is a difference between  men and women regarding what stimuli sexualy arouses them    Do you have evidence to back up what you re claiming   Can you like me some studies please 
Feminism,1615665753,But if it s a social problem we need to talk about it and that ll make all the  not all men men uncomfortable  D 
Feminism,1615663657,Toxic masculinity plays a role alot of comments on Facebook telling men to man up and protect women miss the point entirely Misogyny is so common I hear it all the time Its because something questions their pride or masculinity and makes them violent I think early education is key to make men less misogynist transphobic and homophobic 
Feminism,1615663315,Well if feminists would just stop saying things like  all men  or  men are trash  or  kill all men  maybe men wouldn t feel compelled to correct THOSE logical errors

Feminism,1615661615,when you mansplain why mansplaining is sexist against men in a feminism subreddit on a post about why mansplaining is sexist against women 
Feminism,1615660717,Wow that example O o  so overconfident and not knowing that China is in Asia damn   
Feminism,1615716957,I think you coming in to comment on a literal  not all men post about how you feel as poorly treated as a marginalized group of people  who again let me remind you were sprayed with high pressure fire hoses for asking for equal rights in some of their lifetimes because a woman called men around you not perfect on the  feminism subreddit speaks volumes to your perceived victimhood Like you realize the  enough men OP was talking about are rapists and murderers and you re in here like  awh they aren t so bad you shouldn t be that upset by it  Rape is shit and people who stick up for rapists are shit by extension even if it s passively and through whattaboutism 
Feminism,1615716627,I doubt anything you or your man bun profit could say would sink in any deeper than what I witnessed as a child I also doubt you or him have done as much real work helping actual victims of abuse  But don t let that stop you from responding with more condescending crap 
Feminism,1615715604,Since it is a feminist forum I am just reading and listening and learning 
Feminism,1615714825,Because it doesn t suit your narrative of victimhood not because it s innacurate 
Feminism,1615714516,Black people are currently oppressed by our government men usually do and have done the oppressing of women Literally not the same thing Deflection much 
Feminism,1615714290,I am guessing that it might sink in with you if you hear it from a man  Listen to what Chris Hemmings says about  Not All Men   The dude goes into schools and helps young boys to understand so it should help you too   Link  
Feminism,1615714130,I dunno mate   which parts don t you agree with That black people are marginalized based on their skin colour in a society that in their lifetime turned high pressure hoses on them for asking for equal rights That men are treated better by a society that has been set up to favor them for hundreds of years That comparing the two groups as being equally marginalized is as abhorrent and privelaged as it gets Every time a dude does this kind of shit a Ben Shapiro gets his wings 
Feminism,1615713751,No I just want you to tell me how those two statements aren t equally abhorrent  You know if you can take time away from your empty self righteous posturing 
Feminism,1615713365,Ohhhhh do you want a pat on the back Still doesn t make your comment less stupid
Feminism,1615712995, gt so why can t you just done this one small thing to make them feel more comfortable  Jesus how many other  small changes do you want us to add to the already large pile of  small changes women have had to make for the fragile male ego Whether  all men or not are sexual assailants I m confident to say yes all men when it comes to this ridiculous entitlement 
Feminism,1615712908,I did read it It was full of completely unfounded and totally inaccurate slander  And nothing more 
Feminism,1615712767,Lovely  More ad hominems  How many hours have you volunteered rehabbing homes for transitional housing for victims of domestic abuse 
Feminism,1615712633,It s a difficult one though The overwhelming majority of men aren t doing stuff like this and to see all these posts generalising the actions of a few as the actions of all is not okay You wouldn t say not all Muslims are terrorists but a few are so we have to be careful of all of them  that s just racist   
Feminism,1615712442,Sounds like you re the one with the hurt feelings  You know nothing about me  Not a single one of your assumptions or accusations is even remotely true which is to say they d all be incredibly offensive if I were inclined to respond with an emotional tirade on par with yours Still nothing you said explains how those two statements aren t equally abhorrent 
Feminism,1615712401,But they prove to us time and time again that half the population   are  usually a threat 
Feminism,1615711701,Lmao who gave this douche an award for his smooth brain take 
Feminism,1615710723,Black people are given poorer medical care have fewer rights are killed because of their skin colour have a very recent history of being literal slaves and their votes are suppressed by white people Yesterday was the anniversary of Breonna Taylor s death a woman shot dead in her home by white police who faced no consequences Men get treated better Men have more privelage higher wages more expectations of equality more opportunities less  not non existent but less expectations of physical and sexual violence against them less blame or consequences for physical and sexual violence to name a few differences Look at the fact that you just threw out a victim card the second you weren t considered perfect and better based on your gender while a woman was trying to make a point Poor me I m not considered better than for five minutes I d better insert my opinion to prove I actually am better than while comparing myself to a marginalized group of people for the pain I felt at not being considered perfect and special during this exchange And before you go there I m a hispanic guy I m just done seeing  not all men try to detract from women s movements because it means men have to stop being special for five fucking minutes so yeah all men Men are trash I am trash because I have to be associated with people like you who can t see women asking for attention and help without pulling out the victim card and saying  b but my feelings are huwt on every post where a woman feels like a second class citizen because she s treated like one Next time your feelings are hurt instead of posting try stepping outside of yourself for five minutes to answer the question why someone might feel a certain way about something if you can t immediately see it Chances are it s because they re being treated in a way you can t and don t have to imagine because of the privelage of being not treated that way so trying to detract from that with weird dogwhistles or whattabouting isn t going to improve the situation for anyone and you re just making an ass of yourself and the rest of  all men  
Feminism,1615708539,If they were so mad maybe they should start getting mad at the rapists and misogynists instead of the women being raped and treated poorly for their choice in words and maybe that s the whole fucking problem  a former  not all men douchebag
Feminism,1615707391, gt No it s not all men But we don t know which men How is that any different from   No it s not all blacks But we don t know which blacks  
Feminism,1615706373,If you aren t part of that  all men group then speak out and talk about the issues and crimes committed against women daily Excluding yourself from the problem will not make the problem go away  
Feminism,1615704985,And it bothers me when someone says  not all men since they are immediately pushing the attention away from the real issue just because they feel uncomfortable by a statement People seriously need to stop jumping to conclusions and think for a sec 
Feminism,1615704931,You brought a really good point because I get the impression that at least here in the West some people accept more easily this prejudice against Muslim which is abhorrent  I say this as a guy that also had a prejudice against Muslims and took some time to change myself   Returning to the topic I find the thinking of this topic kind of disturbing and even hopeless if you think that almost half of the world population is male and you perceive half of the world as a threat to your life you are doomed   This thinking is not only bad to the male but to the female too especially those who had traumatic experiences 
Feminism,1615704304,In that moment give her quite a bit of space Cross to the other side of the road if you like make it clear with your body language and gait that you re just a person trying to get from point A to point B and have zero interest in her  But if you want to help women feel safe you can also try to make the world a safer place Copying an older comment of mine    gt You can educate yourself I d start with the book Sexual Citizens    gt    gt You can get involved in local politics and advocate for more effective legal frameworks to fight abuse and assault    gt    gt You can donate and volunteer for nonprofits that provide resources for battered women    gt    gt You can call out sexist beliefs and behaviors in your friends and family    gt    gt You can as an everyday practice  be aware of how you might be impacting women      gt    gt You can teach your children especially boys about how to be effective allies    gt    gt These are all starting points for ongoing efforts It isn t something you can do for a day or a week and then declare victory Learn give and lift as you are able    gt    gt  Here s a discussion   on another subreddit that I think you will find informative 
Feminism,1615703625,Yes when you advocate for that kind of thinking you indirectly make it acceptable in other situations too Now progressive people will say that it s not the same when it s applied to a minority or oppressed group and rightfully so But the thing is we don t all agree who s the victim and who s the oppressor Both TERF and the superstraight nuts think they are oppressed by trans people Fascist believe jews are the oppressors and immigrants are invaders and so on If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor Surely no fash believe all jews control the media or whatever 
Feminism,1615703029,Yeah its a bit of a sticky situation because I know the intentions of it but it still hurts I am a muslim and it is as if someone would replace the word men with Muslim and with the controversy of hijab and burka ban s going around in Europe it just does not make sense to me Its so discriminatory
Feminism,1615702971,The language is illustrative that the generalization is already happening Rape and harassment is just that common of an experience that we first prepare ourselves for the worst It s normal if it makes you uncomfortable If you are ever walking in a dark street and there s a single woman she WILL be aware and take precaution  cross the street have her keys ready so she can drive off etc   If you invite a woman over to your house for the first time she WILL tell her friends your name  amp address just in case Her father and brothers WILL be worried when she starts dating you It s nothing against you I m sure you re a nice person but until she gets to know you there s a real risk for her 
Feminism,1615702479,Let me try to you all think about this point by just changing the subjects   Most of the crimes here are committed by black people I was robbed several times not even one of them were white or Asian or another thing then black and I m even black too my direct ancestry were slaves and indigenous   So I could say I don t know which blacks are criminals or no if I m walking alone and see a black male I ll presume that he is a criminal and take care       No its not all blacks But we don t know which one       One black man with the wrong intentions is enough men to be afraid Well put         I don t agree with this and I don t find this thinking fair I prefer to presume that all blacks are innocent and decent men just like me until they prove contrary

Feminism,1615698260, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action     
Feminism,1615697691,If you want to compare this to the race situation the true analog to the criticism of men would be the criticism of white people not of black people At least there people are starting to realize that we re talking about white people as a monolith and not every individual white person so we don t have hashtags like  NotAllWhitePeople floating around 
Feminism,1615695174,Women  We are fearful of men and with good reason  You  Well that s just hurtful What about men   
Feminism,1615694434,No because the proportion of men versus women who are rapists is much higher      percent  And rape is way more common than murder Most of us know a rape victim 
Feminism,1615693890,This problem can so easily be solved just by using a qualifier Say  some  or  too many  Anything It s literally that simple You know by this point that a lot of men  notice the qualifier take issue with being overgeneralised as rapists and misogynists so why can t you just done this one small thing to make them feel more comfortable 
Feminism,1615691013,Ive said this before didnt know she said it too Thats cool great actor too
Feminism,1615689484,Don t spread bullshit that s not true If you re sexist just say it 
Feminism,1615689219,Men are not saying that she should have been careful from my point of view From what i ve seen it s men getting told that they are the problem which is generalising and doesnt help the situation
Feminism,1615688654,I do believe it s all men All male humans are socially conditioned  whether they realize it or not to be ignorant of women s minority position in society and their passive or aggressive complicity to th issue 
Feminism,1615687276,basically the same thing as saying that all black people are killers because      of americans are black and      of americans who got arrested for murder in     were black  which makes it statistically  x as likely to kill someone if you re black 
Feminism,1615686021,A downvote No explanation or comments You are up your own asshole 
Feminism,1615684891,Because other  groups of people are much closer together  groups  meanwhile the   sexes group that accounts for nearly     of the humans on earth also seems to have the biggest difference between groups Testosterone and Estrogen create much much more differences in people than Italian and Chinese blood could ever  So naturally people are gonna lump them together until the day they die Doesn t mean all of the criticisms found by lumping people together just because they are M or F is bad But stopping there without understanding the full context of a human being and simply saying  boys are bad because they re men will always be circular and invalid logic

Feminism,1615739896, Calling out   blaming Yes all men should be called out to do better because we can and we should  If you re doing everything you can that s great   Keep it up  And make sure to hold those around you accountable as well If you re doing everything you can then you shouldn t feel personally attacked by this  It s literally as simple as that 
Feminism,1615739759,Yes This tweet and many of the replies are broad brushing men 
Feminism,1615739588,Yes Some of us do This tweet is using a broad brush and I don t think that is helpful to affecting change 
Feminism,1615737847,Just listen When you do hear or notice something speak up And if you don t then just listen 
Feminism,1615737801,Nobody is blaming men as a collective here  I am a man if you think this is post is calling you out it s because you re part of the problem 
Feminism,1615736738,I m gonna go ahead and say the intervention part isn t true I had a friend who casually told me a story about how he basically sexually harassed a girl and when he was called out on it his only response was the get mad and defensive I m gonna go out on a limb and say most of the guys with these tendencies towards women will not react well when called out even by men This isn t to say it isn t men s jobs to call out toxic behavior just wondering how we can realistically correct it if the people perpetrating it don t want to hear it

Feminism,1615735147,Pretty sure women are more likely to be assaulted by a friend or family member than by a stranger 
Feminism,1615734147,It basically tribalism     people stick  up for those they feel empathy for whether they be men or women or animals I do agree though that women needn t be trusting of men who are strangers It s  simply not worth the risk So if this makes them unfriendly then so be it They needn t bother 
Feminism,1615733456, gt then why aren t all men helping women in ways that would lessen the violence women face That s my point The OP and many others like you demand that literally every single man act in a certain way That s absurd There are many ways to effect change and support without following your demands  gt Misandry does not even exist Yikes  gt I just know you re racist in the way you refer to black people as  blacks as well as stereotyping Muslims as terrorists Honestly I can see why you would say this because it does feel a little rough coming off the tongue But the verbiage has been very fluid over the recent years and there really isn t an accepted term yet People of color colored people black people blacks African American etc all offend someone for some reason Know that I acknowledge that but saying I m a racist because of that is a way to try and dehumanize me so you don t have to address my argument or simply ignore it as invalid The Muslim thing was also part of the point I m making Reading comprehension will tell you that I don t believe Muslims are terrorists The statement is terrible and very bigoted However I simply crafted it using the exact language of the original post to make a point This tweet OP basically says  all men are the problem in some way  How would that read about blacks whites Muslims women etc  etc 
Feminism,1615733421,It s  very counter productive to blame men as a collective Most intelligent decent people will not tolerate harassment 
Feminism,1615733207,Probably not  all       but  many  Feels like a some kind of competition or a revenge on men honestly To make such broad and stupid assumptions Maybe women should hang out with more men Feels absurd to read these threads as a man who doesn t witness that much harassment in social circles nightclubs or such environments And if it happens it has instant consequences 
Feminism,1615733177,I know for a fact women do not have talks with daughters about men s safety
Feminism,1615732852, We dont know which men is the slam dunk argument for me I dont know how people can t understand this concept
Feminism,1615732465,There are absolutely men that stand up and advocate for women s rights and safety It is unfortunate that you haven t met any and that makes it obvious that there aren t enough men doing that But they do exist

Feminism,1615730693,Too little too late I woke up a few days ago to check my social media to be attacked by    of people that I use to call friends People posting stuff saying  all men are responsible all men are complicit  Because of  what some sick psyco did to some poor woman in London It is not my responsibility for what some random stranger does Period I know who I am and I choose to spend my time with good honest people I don t need to influce the  bad men because I don t spend my time with those kind of people It is not my responsibility what strangers do I was lucky to be brought up by an amazing single mum that taught me right from wrong She is a saint  It is not her responsibility for what a stranger does I was a feminist until a few days ago Feminism has lost a good ally And I can t be the only one  I want to thank a lot of friends that targeted those kind of men in their posts And didn t attack and blame good people    Feminism and any other political activists don t do enough work to stamp out their respective extremists It s those extremists that make people lose faith in that cause The exact people that you actually need on your side The irony  I no longer consider myself a feminist I will continue to do the right thing and campaign for change but I will not do it under the label anymore  Seriously fuck you  Don t waste your time commenting on my post because my notifications are turned of
Feminism,1615730691,I ve seen it in my group of acquaintances  I m very deliberately not calling them  friends   Some of them are fairly decent when talking one on one and almosr none are ever outright shitty when talking in front of the girls but when it s only the boys around it s open season for all the misoginy body shaming and anti feminism imaginable  And the less shitty more reasonable among them are dragged along as well because you want to fit in On the other hand any criticism is met with open resistance from the ringleaders I ve distanced myself from them I ve come to the conclusion stopping them or reasoning with them is out of my reach and only further fuels their narrative I try to keep touch with the ones I consider my friends still to keep them grounded away from that extremism I m not saying this is always the case but it s heartbreaking seeing previously reasonable people radicalizing and being powerless to do anything

Feminism,1615726703,This touches me deeply I just had a discussion with my brother and dad about this They just don t understand My dad think that he is going to protect me from everything and my brother is focused in not all men They didn t listen when I tried to explain to them that while they don t physically harm women they need to change their behavior regardless of jokes the way they talk to my niece  boys don t cry and stuff and their lack of listening to us women
Feminism,1615726524,They don t exclude portrayal of gender roles but Kelly Reinhardt s films usually subtextually comment on them especially in Meeks Cutoff and Certain Women 
Feminism,1615726495,Hmmm   Replace the term  Men with other religion ethnicity race etc etc And it comes off as being discriminatory as fuck 
Feminism,1615726293,I think a big part of the problem is that the men who treat women like shit often group together and validate their behaviour within those groups I can t honestly say there are any guys I know who are or have been shitty to women  to my knowledge  And that s another part of the problem I don t know how my friends treat women when I m not around It s hard to call someone out on something if I have no idea what s going Best I can do is lead by example whenever there s an opportunity to do more than be passive and hope it s well received 
Feminism,1615725872,As a man with narcissistic tendencies myself who hopefully didn t cause any trauma or anguish but certainly was unstable in past relationships it s very common for me to want to publicly display somehow that I m  reformed and think people will see that and fully change their mind about me I personally have stopped myself every time and realized the moment I do that will be a complete disgrace to the movement and everything I ve learned from it  I have absolutely  sympathy for myself and others like this I just imagine this sort of thing is really common Just another opportunity for men to take over what belongs to women and expect credit and praise while not having to deal with the stakes of it 
Feminism,1615725746,If everyone actually did what they could this would no longer be a problem Maybe you do but maybe someone else dont
Feminism,1615725672,Another redirect See This is the actual problem She raises a question and you go WHAT ABOUT THE WOMEN Taking away yet again focus It s just another way to say  not all men 
Feminism,1615725561,That s the thing the day the men says enough to the abusers it will stop right away If your friend acts badly towards a woman at work and you tell him they buddy I don t accept that kind of behaviour He will literally never do it again the shame to lose face in front of another man But as long as the abusers friends look the other way or even laugh it s consent enough to even make him escalate his behaviour It s obviously not enough with women saying stop 
Feminism,1615725475,I agree still you have to consider that all this information is not reaching the people it is supposed to reach Some random teen encounters part of it gets into a twitter argument with a few trolls and then starts to think that feminism is about hating all men A possible ally is turned into a misinformed bystander and people on the fence are driven towards misogyny 
Feminism,1615725118,Hmm we do what we can to make it safe for the people  we care Unfortunately we can t stand up for everyone 
Feminism,1615724929,Oh have you decided to pretend you were joking because your insistence that your volunteer work makes you more knowledgeable about abuses committed against women than women themselves wasn t working Get the heck out of r Feminism You clearly are not a feminist 
Feminism,1615724699,Valid point but do all women do that too I can promise to you that I m more worried about the effect my mother will have on my niece than my brother
Feminism,1615723881,Sadly I think the answer is no not all men do stand up for women It s one thing to say you believe in equality and fair treatment and another thing entirely to call out your closest friends and family on harmful behaviour Personally I don t know of any other guys in my life who have actively stood up for women myself included if I m being honest 
Feminism,1615723815,I should be able to express whatever I want about my trauma publicly without being bullied and re traumatized If you don t support women healing in the ways they choose to I suggest you leave this group

Feminism,1615721827, the actual victims of abuse I ve worked with have acquired a pretty keen sense of  which men   If true then what you re saying is   women need to just sense which men are bad but also that women who do have this sense are not saved from abuse anyway With that solution being flawed shouldn t you agree that abusive men are the problem not women wary of abusive men

Feminism,1615720427, gt Judging by the number of repeat clients it would seem  which is their type  This is pretty well researched in the field of psychology It s an aspect of trauma bonding a person within a traumatic relationship   abusive harassing sexual violence anything like that   will sometimes become dependent on the person abusing them Which can happen for however many reasons often gaslighting or simply not having a way out   it s safer to become dependent than to completely isolate yourself and to put yourself into a potentially more dangerous situation by leaving You can just google trauma bond if you want it explained in better terms Once the victim of this leaves the relationship however they ll often get into relationships with other abusive people Not because that s their  type   which is just a sickening thing to say honestly nobody goes out of their way to find abusive partners   but because the traits extant on their previous abusive partner that they  fell in love with will also be extant on new potential partners The trauma bond doesn t magically go away when you leave a relationship and if you became bonded to a person who was emotionally negligent and ignored your interests then its easy to become attached to another person who is also emotionally negligent because that s simply what love looks like in your traumatised experience It s also that abuse can decimate your self esteem So you leave one abusive relationship but can often feel like you deserved the abuse or at least don t deserve true love so you re willing to put up with other abusive relationships because at least then you re not alone with your own poor mental state

Feminism,1615746719,I don t personally think this is a man vs woman thing For instance I doubt many women have step up for a man when they see their wife belittling them in public Or that many daughters have discussions with their parents about the importance of men s emotional mental well being But that doesn t make all women coabusers  What s going on is called the bystander effect When you are taught cpr you are told that you can t just say  call     to a crowd No one will act You need to say  hey you in the white shirt call      The key is to transform it into a personal responsibility issue Otherwise people of both genders will just stand idly by and watch  So in general we need to create a better society with more empathy and personal responsibility We need to create people who will stand up and act against injustice when they see it whether it be related to sexism racism income inequality etc And we need both men and women doing that if we want things to change It s so so hard as people are wired to be risk adverse and not sacrifice themselves for others So rather than blast people for not standing up we should frame it in a way where we praise the people who do People like to be praised and get defensive in the face of criticism So I think with these types of issues you go with the carrot rather than the stick
Feminism,1615746338,I understand that sexism against women tends to happen more often than against men however if you are really looking for true equality surely you should still be asking the same question about women when there is sexism against men Both are a problem  Would just like to add though that I do still believe every point here is valid however it is unnecessarily targeted at one gender and I hope I don t have to point out that that is the sexism you claim to be against

Feminism,1615741238,this is something I talk about a lot I m a white cis hetero  presenting I m bi but in a committed relationship with a cis woman man the kind of shit that other men will say to me expecting me to be  in on the joke is deeply disconcerting in the before time I worked in behind bars so there was often ample opportunity to experience casual misogyny of men who thought they were  safe to speak their mind total head scratcher that people think how they behave around women is the only meter they will be judged by I like to think I ve confronted men about this in as productive ways as possible but it s really something you have to put effort into and I can t imagine it s incredibly common I have a massive amount of privilege and it s often deeply uncomfortable all the same

admittedly the lack of used to be a huge problem within feminism and still is in large parts  It also doesn t bring up anything about how feminism has progressed the discussion about gender in academia something which I suspect is very undervalued In other words it focuses on specifically men s issues that are not related to sexuality race etc The intention is not to say feminism is equally about men as it is for women it does certainly focus on women and is completely fine doing so but the point is that the larger majority of the movement do care and that there is an expanding space within feminism that can and do talk about it Solving men s issues help women and vice versa  though my personal opinion is that it s most effective to do both  The goal is to give feminists an easy

Feminism,1615776292,This is something I have been trying to do   Honestly I catch myself mostly   It just reminds me that it takes continual effort to change 
Feminism,1615776061,Yup I get really pissed when I see an insta post that s like  girls guys   insert stereotype  like holy shit what s so hard about putting  some before it What s so hard about not generalizing
Feminism,1615775871,Yes and I feel as if over generalizing of people  amp groups is the cause of a lot of mis understood issues nowadays 
Feminism,1615775771,Exactly Said it on another post but gonna say it again because these posts keep popping up Not all men is used as a derailing tactic They know what they re doing The more you spell it out for them in posts like these the better their strategy is working We are teaching and wasting energy engaging with dumb arguments rather than actually discussing more pertinent issues Stop humouring them and let s get back to having actual fruitful discourse in the FEMINISM subreddit 
Feminism,1615775719, gt And who are responsible for constantly perpetuating those stereotypes Everyone is responsible not just men Come on this is basic feminist theory that you re getting wrong
Feminism,1615775440,That is a good point I think the problem with the post is it is singling out physical harm instead of just power in general Expanding it to power makes a better point but the tick analogy doesn t cover it very well then It s also is a bit too much of a blanket statement  But it s enough to keep us in a constant state of fear  This is saying that all women are always in fear because of the potential of physical harm from men  I guess the question is who is the target audience If it s meant to show people who don t understand what you explained it doesn t do a very good job You however summed up what it should have said very succinctly I think it s very easy to say men have many different types of power over women and almost all men have abused that power even if only minimally It s much more relatable and less polarizing Anyway I m new here and if I ve come off as ignorant please let me know I m here to try and be less ignorant 
Feminism,1615774979,I don t like generalization I see through the intentions of those people who rush to say  not all men to downplay women s problems But when a person says something bad and adds  all men to it then I really think that s wrong Isn t the point to just get rid of generalization entirely 
Feminism,1615774929,I think when people say  not all men they re trying to call out the fact that some people think  all men are fucking idiots and  all men can go die in a hole  Nobodies saying women should just stop worrying when they go outside in the dark and worry about being sexually assaulted 
Feminism,1615773659,Thank you for spreading awareness you honestly never know who you can reach with this message and how they can become inspired to make a change Here s to collective responsibility for improving women s safety  lt  
Feminism,1615772401,I mean    this isn t an original post they still have guardians in some countries 
Feminism,1615771680,I wish some of them had juuust this much self control
Feminism,1615770462,I just wanted to come here and say that men are not monsters we are humans U guys have created this narrative that men do all the wrong and women are absolutely blameless for their actions While  women dies at the hands of a bad person does not mean all men are responsible for his actions Young men die everyday and as a young man u have a higher chance of dying in the street then women We are not monster stop trying to demonize masculinity Its  women who died why don t we bring up all the wives that kill their husband s and get away wit it 
Feminism,1615770178,It s true that  notallwomen falsely accused men But do all women work to make sure their fellow women do not falsely accuse men Do they interrupt troubling language and behaviour in others Do they have conversations about mens safety consent with their daughters Are  allwomen interested in our safety 
Feminism,1615769706,The difference is about power dynamics and what the agenda is  When it comes to violence against females the group with less power is developing safety strategy based on frequent experiences so they don t continue to be harassed by those in power  The agenda is equality  In the case of refugees the group with more power is bullying the group with less power using isolated incidences as examples The agenda is political power  perhaps sprinkled with white supremacy  Essentially those in power should not abuse their power As a corollary it s vitally important we all recognize where we as individuals are in power and where we aren t A same person can be in different categories for different issues  eg a male refugee is in power as a male and not in power as a refugee We should help him out as a refugee but call him out if he mistreats his wife  
Feminism,1615768995,All people have a duty to work for the betterment and safety of others 
Feminism,1615768959,I think it would make a difference if we started to really acknowledge the mental health and substance abuse issues that contribute heavily to violence against women 
Feminism,1615768817,I mean I m sure there are men I would consider or at some point have considered friends who do those things but they don t do any of that around me I mean I m not really a man but most people only know me as one so maybe it s different for others but I think a lot of times men who do say and do this shit know who among their friends they can get away with being open about that with 
Feminism,1615768758,Kinda late out here but look up the Polgar sisters They re kind of like real versions of Beth Harmon women who made it to the highest echelons of competitive chess 
Feminism,1615767957,Cap I m not a baby sitter not responsible for the shitty behavior of others  Or can an individual woman really not take care of themself    I swear none of you are actual feminists
Feminism,1615767435,Yeah not all men are abusers but enough are that its a problem
Feminism,1615766185, gt He will literally never do it again That s incorrect Is this anecdotal or just something you assume would happen if a guy was called out because that has NOT been my partners  m experience    When he s called guys out for bad behaviour he s been met with denial anger brushed off and laughed at ignored and very commonly gets ganged up on by other guys in the group who also feel attacked because they do say the same shit Any other time he gets along with these same guys really well just not when he s calling them out   My partner sells cars and deals with a lot of sexism and monogyny among the salesmen and mechanics An example of behaviour    Woman comes in to deal with the company for whatever reason mechanics get all excited and start elbowing each other encouraging each guy to try get a look even if it s to go into an area they normally aren t in talk about what they d do to her partner hears it and tells them their behaviour is gross and desperate they laugh and tell him to basically F off he s just emotional white knight SJW etc    Second example Partner was out of town for training along with another dude when they go out for dinner before returning their hotel Not long after partner learns this dude has a GF he sees him on Tinder trying to hook up with multiple girls for the ONE night they re staying there Partner calls him out gently saying  that s messed up     it s been a year and half now and this dude hates his guts still and tries to mess with him   Last example His friends he grew up with used the word  gay to express annoyance disgust boredom etc He decides to call his friend out on it one day friend thinks it s a joke and not serious keeps doing it multiple times until he realised partner is serious sort of stopped doing it for a while before going back to it because he  has gay friends who said it s ok so it s ok  Didn t have much to say when my partner responded back that both him and I are bi and my brother is trans and we re actually not ok with it It s toned down now but it hasn t  literally ever happened again like you want to believe    I m not attacking you or your ideal situation because how freaking great would it be if men DID just need one talking to by their mates before they changed their behaviour Sadly that s not realistic though It takes people a while to accept they might be wrong about their long term behaviour and longer to rewire the brain  especially the older the person is  I mean would you instantly change when    people never had an issue with your behaviour over   years but now one random friend is saying you re not actually the nice upstanding person everyone else said you were 
Feminism,1615765312,That s just blatantly wrong Nobody should be assaulted in anyway and yes women are victims dramatically more often but this type of comment does nothing to change anything    
Feminism,1615764330,I read it it s indeed a cohesive study But the solution in the conclusion doesn t put the blame on the idea of  false perception of female innocence but the fact that gender stereotypes put many of those men in positions where they are unable to identify their own abuse And who are responsible for constantly perpetuating those stereotypes     Gasp   Men did you shot yourselves in the foot and now you want to blame a statistic on women even when your own article concludes the problem is a male made issue unless you want to argue that somehow women were able to perpetuate those stereotypes 
Feminism,1615764053,Uhhh   because we don t care for being harassed assaulted raped murdered etc I know women am I right   
Feminism,1615763947,Plus  speak to your sons Make them a better ally and they ll be stronger men and happier people It s not a zero sum game 
Feminism,1615763844,My book What English grammar   I think you re trying to troll feminism but realising that grammar pedants are a far greater threat  Feminism is cool tho 
Feminism,1615762194,I have a question so why do I always here women being scared of men when it s dark in the streets
Feminism,1615760803,standing up for women didn t stop me getting raped by one I don t understand these rhetorical statements of course not all men are interested in this as not all women are interested in treating other women or men as equal shitty people exist everywhere and it doesn t matter what gender they are 
Feminism,1615760616,says the person who cannot find any counter argument to change my mind of course I have other thing to do than speak with ppl that disagree with me but cannot find anything to change my mind good luck finding gender equality with such methods cause if you can t explain me how I m wrong when I m all ears of course I won t agree with you
Feminism,1615760040,Yes it is absolutely your responsibility to call out sexist comments and jokes towards women not doing anything about it leads to desentisization of sexual assault and rape therefore less likely to take sexual assault and rape seriously which is why women talk about their greviances men don t believe them In the UK    of young women      years old have sexual harassment it s not women s job to fix this it s a problem with men and it is our responsibility to flattern that percentage not taking reponsibility as you said makes you part of the problem
Feminism,1615759940,You re only showing your ignorance Since you re so insulted I m sure you will find something else to do 
Feminism,1615759843,says the person who is straight up insulting me  and no it was not useless I m showing my disagreement based on facts hoping people would be a little bit open minded but I guess insulting strangers is waaaaayyyy more useful
Feminism,1615759691,This is a really good start u LapisRS I wish more men would simply   ask  the way you re doing    You might also listen to the women around you when they complain about things men say or do Or ask those women about it giving them a safe space and making no comments when they answer you There are obvious things that men say and do that range from inappropriate to harmful but there are also things that may seem innocent but make a solid percentage of women feel uncomfortable or unsafe For example a while back I complained to an otherwise pretty forward thinking male friend about how hard it was to find a boyfriend to which he replied that maybe if I smiled more and let strangers approach me I d have a boyfriend Stuff like that 
Feminism,1615759428,And as a woman I can believe that because most men that I ve encountered have been very respectful to me 
Feminism,1615758532,  If you read and understood the comments you would know not to say something so monumentally useless 
Feminism,1615758500,Ok but men don t owe you protection Thats it thats why Do you jump to protect men No you don t 
Feminism,1615758351,ok so you re making the assumption that all men do these things and that s not true  I am an exemple at least no I read only the comments not the responses so I had a global idea of what feminists wanted to say and how they are thinking
Feminism,1615757346,or maybe you didn t find the right partner we all got our ways and there is probably one person there that like the same thing as you
Feminism,1615757343,Probably an unpopular opinion that will kill my karma but I m not sure that all men having a duty to be the protectors of women is feminism This reads more like   th century coverture 
Feminism,1615757265,the username is a pure joke don t use it as an argument and don t think you re smart cause you pointed it out  i m not saying you are 
Feminism,1615757126,Congratulations You ve never had to deal with the men you know in private when they re horny  I m sure you re scrolling backwards through r feminism to be super helpful 
Feminism,1615756956,as a man who was raised among men I can tell you that nobody says that I never heard that in whole my life

Feminism,1615781167,Black people commit a disproportionate amount of violent crime in the US By the logic of OP s info graphic it would be fair to said  black people are criminals and when called out on it retreat to  well no no no I don t mean  all black people I m just using general language to point out a trend  It s ridiculous Generalizations are harmful We shouldn t make them about men or blacks people or Syrian refugees

Feminism,1615780717,No that s not feminist theory feminist theory takes into account that those with power and influence have a larger hand in shaping stereotypes and that those in power and with influence are largely men Feminist theory surrounds the idea that both sexes are victims of the system but makes no r ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM type claims that somehow both sexes have an equal hand in creating that system

Feminism,1615780465, gt This is true though Whenever I am walking in the dark I  am always in a constant state of fear Even it s not dark and I need to walk past a group of men who are loitering there is a baseline fear always  My smart watch will show a sudden increase in heart rate  Ya I see what you mean there It s an odd dichotomy that men can both make women feel safe and also fear just by being present I was picturing walking with my wife This would make her feel more safe However I m sure she would still have some fear walking past a group of men even if I were with her Depending on the situation of course Plenty of food for thought there Idk I guess it was hard for me to identify with the core of what the post meant And then I see comments like some in this thread basically saying that if someone doesn t get it now they never will Well I didn t get it and you helped me understand I know there are people who fight against this and  not all men is a tactic I feel like at a glance it s a damn good tactic for someone who doesn t want to understand Someone who doesn t want to examine themselves gets a free pass because they aren t violent Now if they re not guilty why get introspective Anyway what I m trying to say is thanks for not being dismissive and taking the time to articulate the subject 
Feminism,1615780403,This argument would also work really well to support a lot of really heinous forms of bigotry like anti semitism as acceptable because  in the eyes of the anti Semite the Jews are the party in power and have the control Or poor white people and affirmative action or men going through family court Just because a group thinks they have less power than another group in a particular instance does not make stereotypes and sexism morally acceptable 
Feminism,1615780175,I just don t think so I owe no duty to you unless we enter into privity Also the post was sex specific It assumes either that women need men s protection or that men have a duty to women or both As a woman I don t need a man to take care of me As a feminist I believe in individualism and empowerment via personal responsibility 
Feminism,1615779407,If I did the same thing with the male reproductive organs this whole subreddit would go ape shit
Feminism,1615779365, when  in   women are only out for the money and the other  do nothing they all are out for the money  Wrong quote  Changed men women Changed shit money How is that quote even a aurgment I used the same aurgment with different nouns and verbs It could apply to so many different things and more clear as to why it as a aurgment basis Doesn t make sense So all drinkers are responsible for all drunk driving deaths  No it s only drinkers are responsible for drunk driving  The whole party isn t responsible for the lesser  of fucked up individuals 
Feminism,1615778730,Good idea for a comic and I agree in principle but this is cringe tbh As feminists we really need more affective talking points than complaining abt teenage boys who say  not all men  It s a fine talking point in spaces primarily for women but it s bringing no men over to our side unfortunately Talking about the  in  women and  in  men and other rape statistics I think is a much better way to converse about rape culture We  need better consent education regardless of assigned gender 
Feminism,1615777906,Oh absolutely I used men in my example because I see them get defensive more but you re right in that it occurs from both sexes quite frequently
Feminism,1615777830,Yeah i guess I was also talking about girls too I don t like it when anyone stereotypes generalizes either gender
Feminism,1615777690,Couldn t agree more Most of these arguments can be avoided by just saying   some men do  x  instead of  men do  x   Imagine actually being able to discuss a problematic behavior with someone because they don t feel personally attacked or accused    That being said the  some is often implied and simply not picked up on 
Feminism,1615777524,Yep this Exactly this See also  a few bad apples instead of understanding the huge underlying systemic issue and way too much injustice 
Feminism,1615777200,It s also similar to racist talking points  Replace the  men with any other group and it s really obvious 
Feminism,1615776949,All analogies are just proxies of the actual issues and they often remove the context My point was that comparing  different analogies doesn t always make sense because the context can be very different  ie power dynamics  I agree that for the same issue you may need different analogies to get the point across to different people In this graphic I am interpreting tick bites as an analogy for  all types of harm  physical  amp mental as verbal abuse is still abuse   gt This is saying that all women are always in fear because of the potential of physical harm from men This is true though Whenever I am walking in the dark I  am always in a constant state of fear Even it s not dark and I need to walk past a group of men who are loitering there is a baseline fear always  My smart watch will show a sudden increase in heart rate  
Feminism,1615797935,I think this thread sums it up Stereotypes and prejudice apology is the right wing approach The left wing one is that it s not men as individuals who are the target of criticism but social structures 
Feminism,1615797646,Some issues are very much gendered though and sexual violence is definitely one of them So yes everyone needs better education but this could be interpreted in a genderblind kind of way which would be a mistake  not that I think that s what you meant by this 
Feminism,1615797641,Someone called this sexist and the comment as well  Takes all sorts  
Feminism,1615796812,as I explained in a similar  thread    gt Now  progressive people will say that it s not the same when it s applied to  a minority or oppressed group and rightfully so But the thing is we  don t all agree who s the victim and who s the oppressor Both TERF and  the superstraight nuts think they are oppressed by trans people Fascist  believe jews are the oppressors and immigrants are invaders and so on  If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not  just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor Surely no fash  believe all jews control the media or whatever 
Feminism,1615795220,Aside from a few factual corrections  as far as I m aware men are punished more severely for all types of crime and are more at risk for violent crime although I could be wrong  I m curious as to why the distinction of privilege is significant in this case I acknowledge readily that racial minorities have been and are oppressed by white people as a class I acknowledge that women are oppressed by men as a class in some respects although unlike with race this relationship is much more fuzzy Nonetheless if I am determining whether or not to cross the street when I see someone of a certain racial or gendered characteristic coming why does it matter if the class the trait belongs to is the oppressive or oppressed group 
Feminism,1615794977,So would it be justified for me to distrust all poor looking people or racial minorities because similar statistics exist for their perpetration of crime or not Is it acceptable to judge individual people based on data about their social class if the price of trust is your own safety  I m asking this in good faith this isn t a  gotcha moment or anything 
Feminism,1615794745,I completely agree with this pic but man it s gonna be weird being a cop and still holding these opinions 
Feminism,1615794226,Ticks don t have feelings though Being innocent with to ill intention but being treated as such is unfair It s like saying all humans are murderers because some are 
Feminism,1615794063,Not the same thing  Cops are supposed to stop such things  If I see someone catcalling or discriminating a woman most of the time the best I can do I is voice my opinion Cops have the authority to stop other cops from doing illegal things 
Feminism,1615793897,No With  all men it s  too many men  With  all cops it s quite literally every single last cop because that s what the job is 
Feminism,1615792517,Except it is all cops The ones who do their job properly and follow the rules are still doing something immoral They re using violence to uphold an unjust social order on the behalf of the rich and powerful Even the nicest neighborhood beat cop is doing that
Feminism,1615792188,As a man I ve been bullied by other men for defending women in certain situations I honestly don t even wanna bring up some of the situation because they re extremely triggering  both for me and also women here but all I can say is be mindful of the way men treat women be mindful of how women feel in the moment and be mindful of the dangerous realities that women face every day 
Feminism,1615792106,I m so glad those pieces of shit conservatives got kicked out in WA Biggest loss in history apparently Now we need to get them out of the government and make them obsolete Can t believe people have been supporting rape enablers for this long When will people learn conservatives do not care 
Feminism,1615792105,People have different life experiences Remember that before you judge somebody
Feminism,1615792072,Listen to her point of view Understand where she s coming from I m a conservative and my best friend is really liberal and we are like brothers 
Feminism,1615791806,Comparing men to ticks is not a good way to win over people  The best way to refute  not all men is to point out that feminists aren t saying  all men are bad in the first place it s the men who are trying to discredit them by unfairly generalizing and trying to turn this into a purity test  bad men vs innocent good men  Feminists say that some men are actively bad many more are disengaged and unhelpful often going along with the bad guys and that more broadly there are broader forces like masculinity and gender roles which can t be discussed in terms of individual guilt and innocence 
Feminism,1615791507,   Damn you both have some great perspective here I couldn t agree more with everything you guys have said and I support women who think this but just because I saw this brought up somewhere else I thought I d help clear it up here    I should preface that I hate the argument that I m about to talk about its based on racist ignorance and doesnt take into effect the context of America s negative history    People  not just women have been trying to find a parallel to this point by arguing that they should similarly be more afraid of black men because they are more likely to commit crime in their area The difference between the arguments is the context that Black people have disproportionately been forced in poorer neighborhoods and been oppressed in the workforce Essentially the crime comes from living in poverty not being black  e g  a third variable  The context as you said seems to play a particularly large role in understanding these types of social points and the variables that cause the social distress Do you have any thoughts on this I would love to hear anyone s perspective on how this point is isn t relatable to the point about men because I ve been arguing with racist family on Facebook about this these last few days I sure could use more help because their sexism and racism is extremely stubborn and frustrating     A follow up point the argument used against men  may be most applicable for anyone scared to walk down the street in an impoverished area at night As a Brazilian American I always avoid going to certain areas of my city in Brazil because they have more crime These areas just happen to be the poorest areas I by no means hate poor people though similarly to how the argument against men doesn t mean that women hate all men There s just strong information that informs our actions to be careful in these social situations    Even though the point above and the point about women fearing men seems fundamentally the same there is a huge difference again it s context The situation with poverty can be changed much faster than the situation with men this is because of how the situation with poverty has been constructed differently If the government just heavily funds these poorer communities we can simply eradicate these criminal differences without the need for more policing which leads to more unnecessary death I don t give a shit if people think my idea is socialist BS  most Brazilian family hate me for thinking this way  they can suck my socialist butt The situation with men cannot be fixed that easily I hope that all made sense I m tired af writing two   page neuroscience research papers studying for exams and barely getting by financially Life honestly makes me so depressed and exhausted but you all make me feel more confident that we re moving in the right direction 
Feminism,1615790956,Excuse mine and his spelling errors  in the post of mean Off not of And On the first photo I meant And not as 
Feminism,1615790789,listen and always be ready to attack when needed fellow white knight
Feminism,1615790637,Okay so the way I look at it is that rather than criticizing men focus criticism on male socialization behaviour So directing anger towards the systemic patriarchal structures that foster toxic male behaviour rather than the general male population That being said I want to clarify that when women make the decision to avoid be guarded around men it is not the same as prejudice Prejudice is hatred or discrimination based on affiliation with a  harmless group while being wary of men is based on the very real threat that they pose to women 
Feminism,1615790528,when people say  all cops and  all men they mean  too many cops and  too many men and some people will really never understand

Feminism,1615790287,I don t think it s a privelege to enter the Millitary on lower standards It s not an office job and it s not bloodless There is a perfectly fine debate to be had about how to integrate women into the Millitary and prepare them to become killing machines  geopolitical agents of dominance However much of the online buzz about this issue seems to be ego driven and is more about affirming men s traditional role as guard dogs than the actual efficacy of female soldiers in question There s been a recent move to make the US ACFT more gender neutral in its standards  here   is an article about that The only rational POV here  within a hawk context is to recruit the soldiers who are best able overall to cope with service duties and then funnel them into specific roles based on their abilities Beyond this there d be a serious values dissonance as it is not fair to endanger soldiers by letting them be ill prepared 
Feminism,1615790080,True Also lots of predators do this on purpose to get women to trust them or they do it b c they feel guilty about their own misogyny on some level

Feminism,1615787139,The most powerful common act I ve seen men do to other men to keep them in check from abusing  amp threatening women is  the Look   I ve seen my son s and other men divert the mal intention of some men with the look that says  you ll have to move through me before I let you hurt her  If you aspire to be a  not all men man you ll have to challenge those  some men often with your eyes and be ready to back it up with the physical  I ve been around long enough to know that that is how the human race rolls  Do you have the buy in to fight for it

Feminism,1615784296, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action

Feminism,1615802737,Not sure if you read OP s question before it was but he specifically asked  how is this  it s not all men but we don t know which men different from saying not all black people but we don t know which black people  I provided examples on how it s not the same and how that felt like an obfuscation and a dogwhistle Comparing yourself to a maginalized and oppressed class when it s convenient to spin a narrative while ignoring the systematic injustices against said class versus the systematic advantages to another to smokescreen and counter an argument that men commit violent crimes against women and try to whattabout the argument into race baiting nonsense is really scummy to do on a board about women s issues and the amount of mental gymnastics required to say  you aren t allowed to talk about your safety or the danger men pose because it s akin to racism is absurd As to your point nobody is going to ask whether or not crossing the street to avoid a man is racist if that man is black versus white except for people fixated on that person s race so your scenario is a bit confusing Are you implying a woman who won t cross the street to avoid white men but will cross the street to avoid black men and women Yes that s racist  If a woman crosses the street to avoid a man regardless of race she s doing what society expects of her to  keep herself safe as it always comes back to when a woman is harmed  She should have been more aware of her surroundings she should have dressed differently she should have crossed the street when she saw someone approaching her she should have blah blah blah and other ways it s not the man s fault for harming her but her own fault for existing But then people want to say  not all men  despite it being a woman s fault for not suspecting it could be all men It s an absurd circular argument that could go round and round forever and everyone is tired of hearing it So to me and a lot of other people it s all men and that s not an issue of privelage or class it s a societal mandate issued by the government who refuses to prosecute men for their behaviors and teach women how to be afraid rather than teach men not to be abusers Women must keep themselves safe because the answer from policing and government agencies when they don t is  she should have suspected all men and acted in accordance with that  
Feminism,1615802690,Precisely What is it about the barrel that allowed the existence continued survival then the thriving spread of the rot 
Feminism,1615801609,Having ones victimhood challenged because men feel embarrassed guilty seems more unfair No women or feminist are saying all men are murderers Like all metaphors it doesnt explore the whole picture  but it adequately explains the concept that male violence and the risk men pose to women can be real without it affecting all women and all men 
Feminism,1615800899,I think the analogy is really powerful At first I thought it was dehumanizing but on second thought I realized it really wasn t it wasn t blaming men or comparing men for ticks it was just explaining the mindset of women who suffered through interactions with toxic and predatory men BUT it s so hard to realize it sometimes I understand that it s not a real comparison but It s kind of triggering to think you re being compared to bugs given that dehumanizing campaigns around the world have compared other groups to insects 
Feminism,1615800413,How is fighting generalisations missing the point ACAB literally stands for all cops are bastards and is not a term that should be said People are capable of understanding unjust acts whiles also disagreeing with people that throw about generalisations that apply to a whole group That s called prejudice 
Feminism,1615798542,Men don t care about you  you re the same as us you ve just got a hole instead of a shaft  nothing special It s  not  our  responsibility  to  be  your  caretakers   Do women care when men are publicly morally and financially raped in the family court system   when men are forced to give up half or more of their current future earnings their assets their house their estate their vehicle and custody of their children Do women care when men are raped sexually abused by women   or is it just played off as a joke  ahem  Cardi B  This isn t about equality or justice  it s about unjustly accusing a specific group of people of being sexual predators when in fact they most certainly are not Men don t owe you a thing We don t owe you protection we don t owe you support and we certainly don t owe you our decency 
Feminism,1615798032,That s why man need to talk to other man and make clear that this kind of behavior is not acceptable
Feminism,1615840961,Sorry I m not buying it  The dude is proud of himself for pissing off  snowflakes  calls himself an asshole like it s a badge of honour and his excuse is that he has trust issues The fuck exactly do trust issues have to do with him thinking he s entitled to comment on what women wear   This guy does not come across as someone who respects women He maybe nice to you but I bet that would change pretty quickly if you started to behave in ways that don t align with his vision of what women should be like

Feminism,1615839094,As I said in another comment he has reasons behind this and I don t think he does either but he also is definitely on the quieter side with most of his opinions And this is the only one I disagree with because he is mostly a feminist he admits that men were assholes in the past And that there are still some who are This is his only flaw If it wasn t I would of already called him out on it 
Feminism,1615838879,He really is this is literally his one flaw He has reasons with it though He s protective because past girlfriends have seriously hurt him and have done awful things to him He had a girlfriend who would rub it in his face that she would stay up late face timing other guys He has trust issues and believes more risqu clothes should be reserved for only intimate partners I agree partly but I also think people should wear whatever they want as long as it isn t straight up nudity

Feminism,1615838434,And then of course since you re the only one speaking up obviously you re the problem 
Feminism,1615838105,One thing you can do is share articles and studies about sexual violence and aggression on social media  be willing to put your face and name behind these issues and amplify women s voices  Be conscious of the language you use and that is used around you when talking about issues that disproportionately affect women Always be willing to learn Know when to shut it and listen Use your voice to amplify women s voices and call out harmful ones  When you consistently behave like an ally women will become more comfortable telling you about their experiences and you may end up learning some surprising things about men you always thought were decent Be prepared to learn those things and considerate of how you respond to what women tell you  Be willing to lose friends over their treatment of women

Feminism,1615835889,Why does it have to be  men in the first place When talking about female harassment and other issues why is it always  men did this etc Do you say humans are killers because some are murderers Or do you call them murderers Why do feminist posts need to begin with  men instead of saying harassers rapists etc Why drag a whole gender into it Is it ok to call all muslim terrorists 
Feminism,1615835197,we already know we really really do But criminals exist most men would help any person in danger but most criminals dont do criminal things with witnesses around   
Feminism,1615834769,Holy crap me too kind of I wrote my dissertation on the depiction of the female nude with the main focus on  Olympia by  douard Manet During my research I came across John Berger He helped me a hell of a lot I still quote him to this day 
Feminism,1615833496, gt you tell him they buddy I don t accept that kind of behaviour He will literally never do it again the shame to lose face in front of another man I take your point that men who abuse women are generally more concerned about their reputation among men than what any woman thinks of them e g a lot of rape culture is about focusing more on notches on bed posts and establishing an identity as a guy who can  score  than focusing on whether she really wanted to  I am afraid this isn t such a silver bullet though Maybe I ve gone about it wrong but it feels like I m just as likely to be accused of something along the lines of  white knighting  It sucks I still feel like it s my responsibility to speak up and I ve long since given up on wanting to  fit in with such crowds but that just makes me more of an outsider to them It s a hard problem 
Feminism,1615828811,Well yes I don t think everyone is going to     agree on whether a particular group is a minority   gt If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor I think this is a slippery slope fallacy and not quite true We should always qualify whether a group is a minority based on statistics shared experiences and common sense I don t think every claim at being a minority should be validated but some will be If when we a consensus on the qualification the logic still applies 
Feminism,1615827900,It s not just about one thing happening three times though It s patterns of behaviour that are all quite obviously rooted in male socialization Rape is just one example I stand by my argument that distrusting men is not the same as prejudice

Feminism,1615822413,I see what you re saying but the statistics do demonstrate that      of rapists are men while there are no statistics to demonstrate that nearly all thieves are black people or that nearly all child molesters are gay If we knew that      of child molesters were from a certain group  orientation race  of course we would keep kids away from that group And even if that rape statistic didn t exist if a woman has had numerous experiences with violence harassment from men and so have all her friends I think that s enough evidence of danger to justify that  prejudice  
Feminism,1615821402,It s a tricky subject because you re absolutely right that women are just protecting themselves from a very real potential threat but when it is advocated so broadly as it is here it feels like trying to carve out an exception just for one circumstance When THEY do it it s prejudice When WE do it it s just protecting ourselves What about people who cross the street or clutch their purse around black people or refuse to trust their money to financial advisors based on their ethnicity or protect their children by not allowing them to be around gay people They all think they re just guarding themselves from a very real threat The only argument you could make to those people is to say  No no but my stereotype is true I m right about this group over here you re just mistaken about THAT group being bad  Your point about focusing on behavior and social structures is dead on well put

Feminism,1615864420,I m not buying it either   Not even nudity should be inherently sexualized 
Feminism,1615863034,You mentioned that you don t blame guys for this because they grew up with that Implying that boys grow up thinking a certain way  amp I feel like you giving it a negative connotation In you negative experience with someone flirting with you I don t know how pushy the guy was so I can t judge you on your personal experience but if you handled it with an aggressive matter that it didn t match the guys approach then I would consider it fiesty as well But considering you were underage he s a dumbass When it comes to jokes it just depends how much you take it personally I ve had people roast me  amp talk shit but I dont care at the end of the day because their words don t affect me  I don t let it get to me No matter what it is But that s me it just depends how vulnerable you are to things like that I mean if someone has an opinion of you being  feisty it WAY DIFFERENT FROM  ALL MEN SHOULD DIE   Those are two completely different scenarios one of them could possibly potentially dangerous Saying all men should die is threatening it could signal that the person could have a mental illness I mean most hate crimes occur off such word like that  Calling someone  fiesty is not even close to ALL MEN SHOULD DIE  Quite an extreme example Hoodies sweatpants  amp sandals are quite extreme tbh but it doesn t mean that there still ain t some sort of parameter that both females  amp males should follow I mean at the end of the day he s a man Men are attractive to women SURPRISE Obviously if he sees a model on ig he s going to naturally be attracted to it Of course if he s a heterosexual or bi You can t blame him for admiring female beauty But see the difference is models are paid to do their job  amp there job is to look  attractive  I bet that he wouldn t marry someone like that tho because men are very selective with whom they want to be with for the rest of their life So that s where the whole women should act like ladies comes into play Because if your not a model you shouldn t be so explicit That s goes for both men  amp women I mean many men are upset of this feminist movement where they feel like they are being generalized as something they aren t I mean having women generalize that men are rapists violators  amp sex offenders does hurt men to hear because not all of us participate in that horrendous behavior Many of us do put a stop to it  amp call it out even if its with the  boys  Guys know when guys are being assholes some of us do control  amp tell the homies to back off So when you got people coming at you or your type of people it hurts It does affect our gender to have to deal with such harsh claims 
Feminism,1615860218,Dude that s not it at all did you see my other messages  I said I absolutely do not blame guys for this Heck I ve had this conversation with him before and we ve agreed and disagreed He talks the exact way We both blame society for both genders being f caked up Today he talked to me about it the same exact way he didn t change his opinion at all And with school dress codes people took that Too far Why do they still consider knees and shoulders offensive Why is that still a thing And I was defensive back because he started with the defense in some messages previously before the ones in the photos If guys can be defensive we can too Also just because they re  jokes doesn t mean there isn t more behind that Calling it a joke doesn t completely cover everything up That s why jokes are offensive because there is Always something behind it There was a guy who was hitting on me he was over age and I m underage and I made that Very prevalent to him and when I told him off for continuing he called me  feisty because I told him he was wrong  He s allowed to have an opinion but what if certain opinions are blatantly wrong like morally and logically wrong In every way It may seem right to that person because that s how opinions work but what if someone says  all men should die would you like that opinion Would you think that s morally and logically correct Also I said I partially agree with his opinion that intimate clothes should be kept with romantic partners But that doesn t mean all women should only wear hoodies sweatpants and sandals Because that s what he thinks But then he s always sending photos of these girls wearing straight up lingerie for likes and says it s hot   He can t make up his mind I have dealt with this opinion for a while now but I got fed up of him saying it Over and Over and Over again saying girls are all thots and such And him purposely being sexist and purposely upsetting his friends over it for fun when it s clearly a subject that has an affect on our gender 
Feminism,1615859711,Right I agree with most of what you said except for   gt Capitalism may be part of it but non veganism is the real issue You basically answered it below that sentence the only way you get to decommodifying animals and liberating the exploited whether animal or human is by first collapsing capitalism If everyone became Vegan there d still be very poor treatment of animals regardless because of industries that use animals for products however if capitalism falls we are able to start a transition to decommodifying products and necessities if you want to go further we can move to growing meat in labs we have already done it but capitalism prevents us from actually making it something to sell on the market This way you have a transition to a free er and more ethical society

Feminism,1615852984,Yes but in the context of the discussion I think more men would be willing to acknowledge systemic violence against women if those issues were also acknowledged  I think many men see statistics on abuse etc and think of it as something they would never do which in their mind diminishes the severity Educating people about why violence against women is still so widespread can help change their perspective

Feminism,1615848361,I define sexual exploitation roughly as using another sentient being for their sexuality reproductive system or sexual capacity in some way whether by overt or subtle force  One need not actually derive pleasure sexually from the exploitation that they are forcing on someone else  e g farmers in the dairy industry do not necessarily get pleasure from it but they still do it  That definition can be refined but I am referring to essentially the ideal of viewing the sentient being as an object and specifically a sexual one What I mean by women betraying other women women who would themselves be at risk of the suffering I am referring to but still choose patriarchy over doing the right thing Women who do FGM Women  and everyone  who aren t vegan Women who traffick other women  or men or children or whoever is being trafficked  Women who join in on misogyny when they are around male friends   amp  x   B I am not referring to someone sexualizing themselves but that may be a part of it Mainly I was referring to the systemic exploitation of women and especially female animals Capitalism may be a part of it but non veganism is the real issue The solution is a paradigm shift in which women are viewed as legal persons and not as objects and a world in which animals have legal personhood and are not used as commodities in any way

Feminism,1615847930,I agree with everything here however I have some questions What do you mean by sexual exploitation What do you mean by women betraying other women In my mind I know what sexual exploitation is being forced convinced that doing something you re uncomfortable with sexually because it s  empowering  however I think there s a difference between someone choosing to sexualise themselves and someone who s actively being forced or persuaded into objectification  With that said I think the only way to solve everything you mentioned is to abolish capitalism once that falls you ll see other oppressive entities falling as well with the rise of socialism 
Feminism,1615847024,We need a name for them that sticks like gorilla glue You need to stigmatize that behavior 
Feminism,1615844417,The main reason that  is used is when generalizing statements are applied to men eg   men are killing women  Although the intent of the writer is probably to say  some too many men are killing women  without that modifier in front the true meaning of the statement is that  men in general are killing women I think that men have a right to defend themselves from statements like the one above that generalize the entire gender Generalizing statements are not really fair when applied to anyone and usually result in unnecessary prejudice and judgement   Not all     are       but enough of them are  is not really a good rebuttal in my opinion You cannot justify generalizations about groups of people just because they may be accurate in some cases Try filling in those blanks with any other identity group besides men and it becomes clear why men respond defensively If a muslim hears    Not all muslims are wife beaters but enough of them are  used as justification in order to group them in with wife beaters they will defend themselves from that prejudicial generalization 
Feminism,1615843216,No it isn t too many More than    of men have never done anything like that You keep defining them by their gender instead of their actions Call them bullies catcallers and rapists but stop generalizing a population of over  billion based on the actions of less than    of it If you want to define criminals by their gender no woman should ever be fit to be a parent because the majority of child homicides and child abuse is done by women But when it comes to them you rightfully call them abusers and murderers instead of generalizing them by their gender Give us the same courtesy

Feminism,1615841754,If he is generally a kind supportive partner then I d be inclined to assume this is just a bit of a blind spot for him and a very clumsy attempt to make you feel less scared  My fiance is a good listener and tends not to give unsolicited opinions on stuff but he has his blind spots and he can be pretty useless emotionally sometimes lol  The important thing I ve found is to just tell him when what he is doing  or not doing isn t hitting the mark For example he tends to just want space when he is stressed out or emotional so his tendency is to give me space  ie basically ignore me when I m emotional  At first I found that incredibly hurtful but over time we both learned that we just have different knee jerk approaches to things so we need to ask for what we want Now when I m emotional or upset and I want to be comforted I just tell him that   I m really upset right now and I want you to listen to me and comfort me  It sounds so ridiculous but it works and he does a great job And when he needs space and I m all up in his business trying to get him to tell me all his feelings he asks me to please just let him do his thing In your case I d suggest you tell him that the way he responded made you feel dismissed and that you want him to be more open to listening to your perspective on issues that affect you as a woman like being afraid to walk alone at night See how he responds to that If he gets defensive call him out on it and bring the focus back to you just trying to be heard and have your emotional needs met

Feminism,1615868858,So if I m understanding the question Should people be more afraid in a financially poor high crime area I think we can disregard race but obviously people will use that as an excuse to single people out Violent crime is clearly one of symptoms of poverty but it isn t a limiting factor You don t need to be poor to have power and abuse it I think maybe violence is the most accessable form of power So in a poor community violence or at least the threat of it is a quick and easy way to have power where you otherwise have very little Of course you have the flip side where the powerful can use violence simply because they have power I think the relationship is all other things being equal  which they are not  most men have the availability to exerte power over most women in the form of and threat of violence Maybe poor communities are the same in that regard The greater potential for violence is baked into the society if you will  And well not all fear is rational We are certainly all afraid of things that will do us no harm We are also unafraid of things that can or will do us harm But the the perceived potential causes very real fear Sometimes that fear is rooted in bad things like racism Anyway don t listen to me too much I ve written and this about four times now My points feel week and I m not even sure I know what I m saying But you put some time and effort into your post and I wanted to reciprocate Hopefully this is far enough down in an old enough post no one else will ever read it 
Feminism,1615867265,No one is trying to paint you as a monster You ve completely missed the point of the post Sure not all men are monsters but most women have been victims and that s a problem 
Feminism,1615865590,I mean   it s not like  not all men came from anyone suggesting  all men  
Feminism,1615924106,I remember seeing on Tiktok a woman asking something like  Are you a woman who owns a business Why don t you have a fake male secretary who emails people for you yet I do his name is Matt 
Feminism,1615923870,mood especially when the thing is touted as so indie and unique like   no my friend super macho men and super femme women is not New and Quirky
Feminism,1615922014,Twitter I think is the most toxic I spent maybe two days on there and everyone was so rude and hateful
Feminism,1615920862,I hate twitter there is so much transphobia and homophobia on there but I find it hard to avoid it because I want to be up to date
Feminism,1615920018,I like pointing out that lots of birds don t have dicks and then asking them if that means there are no male birds Try it They either go totally blue screen or fully Anakin it s brilliant 
Feminism,1615917383,Honestly is not that much different from any other form of fiction Japan has never been specially on the vanguard of feminism equality and many animes are at its core the product of just one person s mind which can be flawed and I believe the majority are men There s also the clich and vicious circle of being written for male audiences which alienates female audiences which in turn feeds the male audience excuses I believe it ll get better as every other media has 
Feminism,1615916098,Actually you re right Thanks for understanding my point as well I was just thinking that since not everyone would actively help someone who gets assaulted by which I mean that if it happens on the street the big majority of people would just turn their backs it s a pretty relevant thing if they actually call the police or help in any other way  But yeah there are also cases in which it s only the bare minimum such as like you said speaking up against racism or correcting a friend for rude jokes
Feminism,1615915982,People are allowed to have different opinions life isn t just one big circkejerk you know 
Feminism,1615915623,Please research feminists general views before making posts Here is one thread  
Feminism,1615915316,Or make a nonsense naturalist argument and make silly comparisons to animals  like chimps where males are supreme you know how like people   th century justified colonialism and slavery 
Feminism,1615910985,I agree in some ways and not in others First of all everyone going vegan would result in animal exploitation industries to collapse and move to other alternatives since no one is paying for their services And if a tipping point is reached and not everyone is vegan they may be toppled sooner Whether or not capitalism is also toppled may be irrelevant and even if capitalism is toppled that does not mean that the world will be vegan Most anti capitalists are not vegan and and most discussions about capitalism are done by people currently using animals as resources They are willing to give up capitalism but if asked no way would they give up their animal products The underlying beliefs that animals should be used as resources for food clothing food and experimentation is not necessarily a capitalist idea but rather an imperialist and colonial idea that others should be slaves  might is right  capitalism comes later  Therefore we need to get rid of the underlying speciesist belief first and anti capitalism cannot be divorced from that AOC is against capitalism and she s not advocating veganism as a moral baseline Bernie Sanders is against capitalism but no way would he give up  his animal products 
Feminism,1615904198,I try to get all my friends to read the Gift of Fear by Gavin De Becker It s about stalking and violence and how to identify the signs 
Feminism,1615904025,Can you ask the editors why they chose this picture for a women s empowerment talk It s very  appeal to the male gaze imo 
Feminism,1615903463,true just that at this point I m not even used with the bare minimum we shouldn t praise someone for doing the bare minimum but a thanks isn t too much at least to show what s right and what isn t
Feminism,1615903205,I blocked it altogether because everytime I saw a post from there it was both terrifying and infuriating and I choose to just not have to see it I don t need  more misogyny in my life 
Feminism,1615901188,maybe but if you don t explain what it is  intersectionality   and why is a central discussion in  modern feminism   how do you expect anyone here to answer you 
Feminism,1615900605,Conservatives being conservatives   and i m really wondering why some women still votes them But anyway besides the anger let s hope that the rapist is found culprit in a tribunal Then that newspaper is doing a defamation campaign against critical testimonies  with just the objective of intimidating them and protecting the criminal is not also punishable by law 
Feminism,1615899600,I do try to but it s impossible to have a conversation or even a debate with her I ve been trying to for years because she s my oldest friend and I don t exactly want to lose her but she doesn t allow the conversation In her mind she s right won t listen to anyone else s point of view and won t even explain her own And she s not just sexist either tbh all round she s an awful person
Feminism,1615898534,I m sharing around lists like the one below about relationships that of course technically have nothing to do with feminism but as guess whom is the victim usually here we are in topic   amp  x   B   unhealthy   healthy          inferior superior partners equal mutual respectful partners  top down approach same level approach  control non controlling  one win the other loss win win  ego no ego  immature behaviors mature behaviors  dependent non dependent  change your partner not looking to change anyone  victim mentality victorious mentality  value takers value givers  non alignment with oneself or your partner alignment with oneself and your partner   What s in it for me    Always about alignment for me    Energy takers Energy givers  Looking for differences Looking for similarities  non appreciation appreciation  disempowerment empowerment  non supportive supportive  off track on track idk i m not sure if it works actually in the way of modifying anything i think are more useful after breaking to be convinced to not return there or to not idealize some disaster but if there are useful there are for sharing   of course thoughts comments etc   are really welcomed just a disclaimer the list not mine but as i m not sure about the source i m not citing it

Feminism,1615948212,Ya we have a hard time taking care of our own here Our coronavirus numbers should have made that clear for anyone who hasn t been paying attention to numbers like maternal mortality But half the country doesn t think that s an issue either It s a sad state of affairs 
Feminism,1615947097,It is higher than it should be in the US But the figure shown is a global number Here is a link to the source   Here is some US specific data  
Feminism,1615936516,It s terrible that it is so high in the USA I think that the new administration is taking this seriously and will address some of the horrible inequality in basic healthcare for women

Feminism,1615934100,Exactly Thanks for writing what I couldn t put into words 
Feminism,1615933568,Thank you so much There are actually a lot of comments on this post that are being immediately that are full of hate Unfortunately I have to see them still because they re emailed to me once they re posted Thank you for seeing me It helps me so so much 
Feminism,1615932821,Tbh Pinterest is the most peaceful social media There is so much sexism racism homophobia and transphobia everywhere else It breaks me 
Feminism,1615930107,What happens when women are in charge of a state s legislature Excerpt   gt Nevada is the first and only state in the country where women make up a majority of lawmakers a historic breakthrough that arrived two years ago Since then women have expanded their ranks to    of the    member Legislature considerably more than any other state  gt The result can be measured in dollars and sensibilities Among the changes are new laws expanding access to healthcare and family planning fortifying abortion rights strengthening the penalties for domestic violence and giving prosecutors more and better tools to fight sex crimes 
Feminism,1615929391,You re forgetting Golden Kamuy Tokyo Ghoul Assassination Classroom Blade of the Immortal Hell s Paradise and many others which portray strong non sexualized female characters 
Feminism,1615924730,They mostly do realize they are those men but they are predators who like harming women and this gives them access to women while also making them look good It s why so many trolls online claim that other people are  virtue signalling  they think that people are only trying to look good like they are An evil pathetic little man I knew used to claim to be a feminist while constantly insulting women and assaulting them 
Feminism,1615986943,Instead of grouping them by sex try to group them by other things i m tired of hearing this while doing nothing wrong Stop complaining and accusing    of the world Stop whining and insulting men ffs lots of ppl have shitty lives men included 
Feminism,1615986081,Totally and utterly disagree  We can always refine and improve how we communicate these things and in order to do that you often need to try to express an alternate view 
Feminism,1615983673,I think a lot of it also has to do with inherent habits that have become normalized for instance the locker room talk Men do it amongst themselves and talk about such horrible things but aren t called out in fact the popular verdict  men will be men is thrown around Well men are being allowed to become misoginists 
Feminism,1615981271,First of all most developing countries in the world sustain themselves off of vegan staples such as beans rice legumes grains Meat and dairy is a luxury Of course there are some people who simply cannot access any good food at all but that s not a why veganism is flawed argument that s just another way in which our global food system is injust  to animals and to humans clearly  As well we currently have enough food to feed   billion people but we choose to use those crops to fatten up animals whom we then murder  turning them into products that go primarily to well off individuals in the west If we care about the fair distribution of foods globally veganism is the only coherent option Can you go vegan Are you vegan Often people point out someone else s disadvantage as a way to say  well that person over there is disabled poor etc and they can t go vegan therefore I am not going to go vegan  This is illogical and it s also selfish to use someone else s disadvantage to justify your own inaction I agree toppling capitalism would be beneficial but again it s an ideology of non veganism that is the primary issue I agree humans need to be liberated as well but that also translates to  We are humans who oppress and slaughter billions of animals and I refuse to liberate those animals until I have my own freedom  We can all choose to not oppress animals by being vegan and most people can go vegan  And if they can t go vegan there are things that are not related to their diet that they can do not go to circuses not buy pets unless they re adopting not buy fur and leather etc  And yes getting rid of speciesism is a huge step in the right direction because that would mean everyone or most of the world has gone vegan and therefore there simply isn t any demand for animal exploitation because everyone has declared  I am vegan I will not willfully participate in animal use and so all corporations and countries would be forced to change  of course it s more complicated  Again there aren t many anti capitalists who are vegan and those leading the political fight  Bernie AOC in the American case would not further veganism since it s not something they perosnally practise 
Feminism,1615981016,This is kinda the most milquetoast  telling off I ve ever seen 
Feminism,1615980846, Image Transcription Twitter       Blackberry Babe     jxnnyway Idk who needs to hear this but topics like sexual assault and racism don t need a devil s advocate      I m amp     a amp     human amp     volunteer amp     content amp     transcriber amp     for amp     Reddit amp     and amp     you amp     could amp     be amp     too  amp      If amp     you d amp     like amp     more amp     information amp     on amp     what amp     we amp     do amp     and amp     why amp     we amp     do amp     it  amp     click amp     here

Feminism,1615976790, I m a dude He s a dude She s a dude We re all dudes hey   
Feminism,1615968872,I  think that by adding cloths it s not possible to find any solution and that  the solution actually goes in the reverse way to remove them without clothing it s not possible to define what s provocative to wear so the  provocation moves to the behavior that is the best definition And actually when people is full naked  in a naturist nudist environment gender differences blur out and on top it removes sexuality that is the other  driver of inequality 
Feminism,1615967662,Disclaimer I am not a feminist I am all for equality but I do not associate myself with the feminist movement in any regard I just enjoy having discussions with people who disagree with me on contraversial topics Disclaimer  electric boogaloo I also haven t watched JoJo s Bizarre adventure I ve seen the character designs though I completely understand your point of view on JoJo s Bizarre adventure the female characters are complete sexualisation and it s disgusting But the male characters also incredibly sexualised  from what I ve seen there might be some characters who aren t  they re all tall muscular jaw lines and confidant looking in posture and body language Sexualisation goes both ways but from what I ve seen one people will tend to only see it towards their gender When I m watching marvel films for example I honestly don t notice the sexualisation of the female characters but I see the sexualisation in the male characters eg Captain America and Thor Now I completely agree that JoJo s Bizarre adventure is too sexualised but it goes both ways and I just ask that when anyone calls out sexualisation they take a look to see if the both genders are sexualised because most often both are 
Feminism,1615967649,It s called  hetero patriarchy  The vast majority of healthy population want a system based on social justice and that of course includes no abuse nor discrimination However a minority wants to keep privileges and for that it s critical to them to abuse the rest and avoid the logical rebellion  This is very hard to sell as such so the narrative works a lot better when it s sold as an abuse chain  So the   privileged class abuse the     but to a percentage      of that    there is giving the other half to abuse The first half are the men and the second are women To the men is told that to protect their privilege above women they must also protect the   privilege And most men bought it Of course that   also spike it with more stuff like nativism racial privilege etc   but the thing is it s really easy to give to each man a woman to abuse because the proportion is     It s not so easy to give to each male a racial slave So women abuse works very well Then the rest of the narrative it s just for filling in victim gaslighting extremism labeling to whoever points the reality intimidation to shut up and keep playing that impossible to win game etc   
Feminism,1615960068,On that last point it s important to note that population is rising and with that people are getting sicker and sicker The mortality rate rising doesn t necessarily mean a lack of care is what I m getting at 
Feminism,1615957494,Your standards are pretty high Should you trust Plato s wisdom He was pretty smart guy but he also had slaves And you re like WHAT HOW COULD HE The truth is that it was common back then It doesn t make it right but you can t judge an old culture by today s standards     We are in a transition right now AoT s female characters are not weak at all  for example Maybe more animes in the future will come with up to date values 
Feminism,1615957322,Conservatives always think that law protect them from being held accounted from their abuses and crimes One thing is law another is justice He is a rapist and very probably he destroyed his victim career to get away with it Who knows if he is also a murder on that  mysterious suicide of his victim after she decided to present charges And who knows of many other women he was rapped  And on top of that if he is innocent why is using his political position to sue everyone to obstruct the investigations and attacking frontally everyone that wants to known the truth 
Feminism,1615956291,The source is at the bottom of the screen Can you read 
Feminism,1615952932,To even call sex work degenerate signals reactionary tendencies to me I can t imagine calling a woman in sex work degenerate what an awful thing to do 
Feminism,1615952746,How about nine reasons to prosecute Christian Porter and the cabinet rapist as well as all the other rape enabling conservatives part of the party While we are at it add severe penalties to those who commit the crime and abolish conservatism in Australia  Wish I could have gone to the March unfortunately couldn t make it I hope the amount of information I gather share and post is enough though 
Feminism,1615952525,It is not possible for everyone to go vegan there are people who can barely afford basic greens thus are restricted to cheap food Not to mention when you live a life that s stressful like that they won t break away from something that gives them a bit of pleasure Capitalism being toppled means there s more incentive for ethical ways of consuming things like I said the chances are there d be more of a push to have lab grown meat and it would be beneficial to have that since no animals will be harmed  I disagree you can t just get rid of speciesism and go from there it s not pragmatic I d need to see evidence that it is in order to see that as another option of toppling the oppressive society  I think our goal should be to liberate fellow human beings first as long as there s a large power above us they ll make it harder and harder to allow people to go vegan why Because it puts a dent in profit people are addicted already and with busy schedules of the working class most people cannot afford to go into the vegan lifestyle right now

Feminism,1616882632,Is this some sort of meta joke that I don t get You don t believe in dividing people into groups and you express that belief by dividing people into different groups like  feminists and  humanists  And dividing people into groups exists wether you want to believe in it or not I mean countries exist and that group divide has a pretty major effect on a lot of things in your life etc etc etc

Feminism,1616876176,Just curious are you from the states and if so which one 
Feminism,1616874278, gt One of the interesting points not illustrated in this graph is that the amount of money an occupation pays is significantly related to the  of men in it Well of course it is it s an average of all jobs whether male or female dominated Of course summing this up will show that men make more because there are more fields dominantly men than there is women and the men in those positions are making more than the women in other fields of work How is that unfair   gt It s that work that is thought to be masculine is more inherently valued than work that s thought to be feminine These issues are certainly related but it s interesting to see how deeply the pay gap is integrated into the workforce Have you done any research into why the gender pay gap exists There s many more variables than just simply men make more Ive  worked in the trades with women who make the same as I do can t produce the same as I do but still are paid the same the same as men who can t necessarily produce the same There are many female dominated disciplines where women are paid very well the same as men sometimes more The pay gap is more complicated than just simply it s not equal men make more than women  Take nursing for example predominantly female paid very well not more or less than men in the field but based on their time in the field to a cap then raises with the rise of inflation the same as their peers Equally governed trades which are    dominated by men women are not paid less they are paid the same but you have to introduce more variables than just masculine vs feminine valued work to get a more conclusive depiction of why there is a   wage gap Search any countries occupational breakdown by gender and you ll see the clear divide of which gender fill jobs more than others and if you understand the major differences between men and women as a whole you ll know why the gap exists we are different in two such ways that s makes us choose certain careers But you also have to take into account simply this     do women want jobs in these fields that are dominantly men most cases no If it was the latter you would be forcing equality of outcome and I don t think anyone wants that in a world where many factors decide who gets a job and the opportunity Women who are firefighters when compared to men make the same amount of money or have the same opportunity to make the same money Not all women want to be firefighters you need to be a certain type of person to work in the field women aren t built for it the same as men biologically speaking they don t have the same muscle mass testosterone aggressiveness   but does that mean for the women who do work in those fields do they get paid less of course not  I just fail to see where your argument and frankly anyone else who doesn t see the clear divide of male dominated work that is more masculine being paid more Well of course because there are more men working in the field so naturally they will be paid more as a collective driving the average up    Is it so hard to believe that Childcare workers for example are predominantly women     and those women are in that position cause they want to be there or dental assistants which make up       How come more men aren t in that line of work I m sure Burly Lumberjack Bill wants to be a childcare worker    no he doesn t because he s aggressive by nature and women dominate those fields because they have more compassion and you don t want aggressive Bill playing around in your mouth There are      Carpenters in Ontario compared to      dental assistants Should the carpenters get paid more than the dental assistants in terms of job not by the determination of masculinity or femininity but danger of the job working in the elements Of course they should and it just so happens that it is a very labor intensive job would a large percentage of the female population do that job    no it takes masculine traits now whether you agree or not the fact is biologically it is a masculine job does that mean that females are inherently undervalued to perform such work No they choose not to do to such work There is an inherent difference when it comes to equality of outcome and equality of opportunity Misreading something that isn t fact and projecting it as something else is not understanding or educating yourself properly on the issue 
Feminism,1616873218,paraphrasing here but something along the lines of  if feminists are so strong we shouldn t let men affect our emotions 
Feminism,1615994095,i think you are right but it s way more simple  and horrible  It s pretty well described here  
Feminism,1615993192,Or if our social media overlords didn t make it seem nonexistent
Feminism,1615992308, Look at me I m not all men But I still don t give a rats ass about women issues I m more worried about excluding myself from the problem because I m innocent even though I m silent  and laugh at sexual assault jokes 
Feminism,1615991831,For real   in honesty I want to hear this person either   defend this horrid position they re attempting to take or   admit they are just defending the  wElL AcksHuAlLy BS that has no place in a discussion about racism and sexual assault
Feminism,1615991768,My last sentence where I say my point is that it isn t necessarily from a lack of care is what I was trying to say You hear more people are dying and you think lack of healthcare services discrimination shitty doctors whatever but if the population is growing obviously the rates of death will go up too But on top of that people are getting sicker cases are getting worse so again not necessarily due to a failing healthcare system though in the US it s certainly a contributing factor 
Feminism,1615991328,There s only so many times I can hear acKsHuaLly    in one day 
Feminism,1615990989,I m all ears to hear your  well thought out position about how sexual assault and racism aren t bad 
Feminism,1615990887, gt For me I appreciate devil s advocate in a scenario where I don t know exactly where I stand but I want to press the person to explain more why their position is appealing But this often results in bad faith arguments because the person is arguing a position they don t hold often by claiming a position of authority that they don t actually possess It s much more honest imo to just say  I m not entirely sure on my position yet My concerns with your perspective is x y z  That sort of articulation is helpful in building the trust and respect you describe 
Feminism,1615990855,What do you think sexual assault is Also I m still waiting to hear the  racism is ok sometimes nuanced argument  And the  sexual assault is acceptable when argument  
Feminism,1615990712,How about devil s advocate as a tool to find a more nuanced position for yourself This must be expressed in a respectful way in a context of trust but surely in such a scenario it can be useful to express tropes  which possibly you are inconclusive on to a person in order to allow them to better explain a well thought position to someone less well thought 
Feminism,1615990565,The original tweet doesn t reference  rape is bad it says there can be no devil advocate position surrounding sexual assault or racism So that is to say that in no way is their nuance to be found in how every single person thinks about every aspect of both those concepts Obviously nonsense 
Feminism,1615990365,lol can t argue that i m not a white dude having theoretical discussions however the idea that a white male is not impacted by gender sexism and the discussion surrounding those concepts is total nonsense It s a shame that there are some who would wish to respond to those who take an interest in experience outwith their own as attempting to frustrate them purely because they defend the concept of an honest devil s advocate 
Feminism,1615990187,Right here     Completely and utterly disagree to      Without genuine trust and respect though it is true devil s advocate is useless in any scenario even more so in ones where the knowledge produced is used to oppress and subjugate as knowledge associated with race and gender often is     You asserted something to be devils advocate to the OP Then you backed off of it immediately proving that your first assertion was the  bad kind of devils advocate 
Feminism,1615989974,How have I abandoned the position My position is that devil s advocate CAN be useful Where have I abandoned that argument 
Feminism,1615989741,So    what s the alternate to  rape is bad   racism is bad  Do tell 
Feminism,1615989730,Your first comment completely disagree when discussing racism and sexual assault we  absolutely need someone to play devils advocate    Your second comment playing devils advocate can be beneficial in some scenarios but there s a nuance to it    Pick a lane friend 
Feminism,1615989366,So when you  play devil s advocate  you re quite literally repeating the status quo telling us stuff that we already know  because not only do we too live in this space and time and therefore comprehend the norms of this cultural and historical place but we also are actively thinking outside of that box which first requires us to know that box really really well And you re not so radically reinforcing that we should remain in that box  
Feminism,1615989327,Devil s advocate does not have to be a case of someone asserting themselves then abandoning a position but I agree there are many who do that For me I appreciate devil s advocate in a scenario where I don t know exactly where I stand but I want to press the person to explain more why their position is appealing For example as a kid at a Catholic school the anti abortion message was drummed in quite hard Abortion was something I struggled to take a coherent position on in which I was always comfortable but it was noticeable that the science led of my peers were pro choice To pick their brains without knowledge of biology it was necessary for me to say  It is impossible for you to define logically when is fine to abort and when is not if you ignore the point of conception as that line in order to access their knowledge of the reality of the development of the fetus in the early stages as basically a tiny clump of cells and not a living human being in a womb Without genuine trust and respect though it is true devil s advocate is useless in any scenario even more so in ones where the knowledge produced is used to oppress and subjugate as knowledge associated with race and gender often is

Feminism,1616930748, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action

Feminism,1617019850, Image Transcription Twitter Post      Amy Fowler    AmyAbroad Doing my makeup on the train this morning and a random man told me he likes women to have a more natural look I told him I like men to have a more silent look          I m amp     a amp     human amp     volunteer amp     content amp     transcriber amp     for amp     Reddit amp     and amp     you amp     could amp     be amp     too  amp      If amp     you d amp     like amp     more amp     information amp     on amp     what amp     we amp     do amp     and amp     why amp     we amp     do amp     it  amp     click amp     here   
Feminism,1617019787,Well if you google it there are articles and links to places you can buy it so    I mean I don t know your standard of  reference and so if you are looking for scientific journals I m not going to look that up for you  sorry I m just tired of being snarked at over levels of evidence you haven t done anything wrong I just get worried when someone wants a link to something that easy to look up that there is a hidden point   
Feminism,1617019586,It s honestly so sad that they even have to create this It s so easy to not drug someone just keep your hands and stuffs to yourself 
Feminism,1617019013,Yes you absolutely right Countries which are developing and are underdeveloped need feminism more than anything And yeah we especially need to spread awareness about those I ll surely cover it in my upcoming blog Thank you for your advice it means a lot   
Feminism,1617018943,If you ll find a reference to the nail polish please share sounds amazing 
Feminism,1617018411,The biggest problem is that the most common date rape drug is stronger alcohol 
Feminism,1617018274,This is so annoying   like you re putting make up on to please him or any other random dude  I love your reaction 
Feminism,1617017889,As amazing as these ideas are I have found that these things tend to be difficult to afford and or access  Not to mention it once again puts the onus on women to check for date rape drugs rather than expecting men to be accountable and not do it  And it also speaks volumes that date rape drugs are somehow much easier to access  considering how often it happens than these straws nailpolish etc that test for it  Creating it is one thing and it s really great but making it accessible and affordable to more than just a select few is what needs to be achieved  And we also should work to make it harder to access date rape drugs and increase awareness in clubs bars concerts etc  to be aware of spiking and taking precautions to make sure cases are reduced and men who spike are held accountable not the women who failed to buy expensive straws and have it shipped from a foreign country and were therefore drugged 
Feminism,1617016575,I ve been hearing about these goddamn straws for long enough now  they aren t readily available at all I cannot find a link anywhere for purchase or anything beyond  women made a straw Great But where the fuck is it   If you want to help with date rapes then maybe make the products available  
Feminism,1617015489,I named two in the post you are replying to it s right up there
Feminism,1615606087,Is it mansplaining if he s wrong I feel like mansplaining should be talking down to women s intelligence when explaining something and when the explanation is completely wrong it should be something humiliating Like not only were you a smug sexist prick but you were also completely fucking wrong you stupid sack of potatoes 
Feminism,1615605992,It s always the data that influences the results that s  the basis of machine learning If people don t want that then they shouldn t use learning algorithm I m  afraid that what these people are suggesting is to feed the system fake data to alter the natural biases 
Feminism,1615605838,I m glad you asked because I was thinking the same 
Feminism,1615605304,This here is a moment to learn from brother  It IS hard not to act impulsively when one is under attack but two things are important    It is your job to control your impulses No one else s And you are responsible for your actions  Full stop   Typing out a comment reading it and pressing Post is not a defense mechanism or involuntary impulse  This sub is not about men it s about women I m here to listen and to learn I believe this is the first comment I ve posted here but I m doing it because its important  If you read something here that upsets you read it twice Read all the comments If you still have some point to make by all means make your point but don t post if you re emotional and don t lash out at people Golden rule 
Feminism,1615603716,Not all men is used as a derailing tactic The people who say it know exactlyyy what we mean but they argue and blame shift because they can t empathize with victims of male violence The more you spell it out for them in posts like these the better their strategy is working We are teaching and wasting energy engaging with dumb arguments rather than actually discussing the issues at hand  the male violence  
Feminism,1615603535,Ignorance about a subject can lead people to believe they are more informed than they truly are  Basically you know so little that you don t understand just how little you actually know Here s hoping I didnt just make an ironic example 
Feminism,1615603339,My intolerance of abusive online men is the driving factor of my commitment   gt Nonetheless you are clearly intelligent and for what it s worth I don t personally think that policing the definitional boundaries of feminism is a very productive use of that intellect  nor is for that matter tilting at the windmills of my misogyny  I hope you are equally concerned about not policing the definitional boundaries of anarchism communism or even capitalism That is I m certain you are willing enough to use that intellec of your to expand the definition of communism and left wing anarchism so that the movements can be equally inclusive of capitalists union busting rich folks and imperialists   gt I ll admit that I should have been mature enough not to continue to engage once the  TIL crap started but we all have weak moments Still this has gone on long enough so I ll end this where I made the mistake of beginning it you have not convincingly demonstrated the necessity of excluding trans men from feminism  I m glad that you are acknowledging your immaturity and accepting that you did mean to gaslight me into accepting that feminists must advocate for trans men as if they are women  they are not   TERFs often gaslight trans women by saying that they don t exclude trans people because they are inclusive of trans men who are unlike trans women are true women   you should consider that point before exercising similar bullying behaviour in future    gt Further abusive replies will be ignored Thank you You are my first online abuser to stop the abuse on your own volition Though I doubt you would keep your promise 
Feminism,1615601426,Once my dad tried to mansplain how playing violin works to me   I have played violin for about  years now 
Feminism,1615600467, gt you don t have to suggest that when you internally think so  gt You are not disagreeing with me but simultaneously abusing and gaslighting me  gt your misogynistic mindset  gt using trans men as bait  gt  feminism should be all lives matter  gt people with internalized transphobia  just like you I honestly don t understand why you are so committed to insulting me I am none of the things you say I am and none of my comments in this thread or any other support your inferences  including the example you cited   Nonetheless you are clearly intelligent and for what it s worth I don t personally think that policing the definitional boundaries of feminism is a very productive use of that intellect  nor is for that matter tilting at the windmills of my misogyny  I ll admit that I should have been mature enough not to continue to engage once the  TIL crap started but we all have weak moments Still this has gone on long enough so I ll end this where I made the mistake of beginning it you have not convincingly demonstrated the necessity of excluding trans men from feminism  Further abusive replies will be ignored 
Feminism,1615598415,There s a fantastic podcast called  You re Wrong About   that devotes a great deal of its episodes to the myriad ways that capitalism uses women by first objectifying them and then vilifying them 
Feminism,1615598211, gt literally said  despite not being women  and haven t suggested trans men were women once throughout the whole thread Of course you don t have to suggest that when you internally think so  gt Disagreeing with you is not abuse I m not an  all lives matter person and my definition of feminism isn t an  all lives matter take But this whole thing started when someone used the term  trans people  which apparently disqualifies that person along with the many others who don t share each of your views precisely from feminism You are not disagreeing with me but simultaneously abusing and gaslighting me You literally tried to gaslight me into accepting that there s no difference between  don t advocate for and  not inclusive of are not synonymous I mean dude what do you think they mean when they talk about inclusion of trans women in feminism  And that last sentence  rans people  which apparently disqualifies that person along with the many others who don t share each of your views precisely from feminism
Feminism,1615597276,She needs to believe this  It s part of learned helplessness  It comforts her as she is trying to survive in a paradigm that dehumanizes her and blames her for things she cannot control  i e the behavior of men   It s frustrating but for her it seems like a better bet for survival 
Feminism,1615596429,There is zero evidence that men s sexual arousal is any more visually stimulated than women s sexual arousal They are not  hard wired that way any more than women are 
Feminism,1615594030,My husband is a really great feminist Always taking my lead on things and is really understanding about how things like not being comfortable walking alone at night are because of crime towards women 
Feminism,1615593321,I must say it is hard to argue with that logic But in my defence It is kinda hard to not act out on emotions when  you feel like something you are think very positively of is attacked Thanks for posting this 
Feminism,1615591772,I think Bombshell is HBO made so I m pretty sure we found it on HBO Max YES FUCK BEING TOLD WE RE OVERREACTING I m so glad my husband isn t that way but they  good guys have no idea how to talk to other guys about it when something shady is said or happens right in front of them Even for the good ones they aren t taught how to be a good bystander and so few people naturally do that  understandable to a degree  
Feminism,1615589029,Thank you for posting this Every time someone says  Not all men  it s like yeah obviously But nonetheless it s a lot of them and those are the ones we re discussing right now so if you can t participate in that discussion then at least stop derailing it 
Feminism,1615587640,Why do I getting notifications from this place I m not interested in this community smh
Feminism,1615586294,Hahaha I had the exact same thought about having in on in the house  I ll just wait until I have older babies and it ll be like Saturday cartoons or having the news on   
Feminism,1615586215,I thought Amy Poehler and the writing team did a good job telling such a relatable story Something we all want to do wanted to do wished we could do afraid to do    I want all the Gen Z s to see this movie and get fired up They are such an ambitious generation already and I feel like they are going to be the driving force behind our next movement So it s up to us any people like Amy Poehler to point them in the right direction 
Feminism,1615586122,Was just about to say men are too emotional to think things through with reason A while ago I posed that meme on FB about how women are seen as so hysterical but men have started literally every war and of course some men had to really really really Google wars started by women just to prove that h t NOT ALL MEN   insert eyeroll  Like yes you re right women are just as guilty of genocide and war crimes as men are 
Feminism,1615586108,tfw men are assumed to be in the right because they got dangly bits or something idk 
Feminism,1615586049,Ooh I ll have to watch that Is it on Netflix too And ugh I despise being told that I m  overreacting  Unfortunately where I live it s like the  Berta boy stereotype that men here are just so privileged and socially inept to see their influence on the women around them 
Feminism,1615585488,Women are oppressed but their are groups of women that are even more oppressed and get oppressed by white cis women
Feminism,1615585279,Maybe because out of all the women of color black women tend to have even more oppressed opposed on them because of their hair and dark skin 
Feminism,1615584664,I was a little too nerdy to experience anything quite like this but I do recognize the idolization of older boys and the way alcohol and drugs seemed  to me to be the way some boys attracted girls attention and affection While my experiences were not quite like yours they were still hard because I was working with a real lack of quality information about love intimacy pleasure sex alcohol and drugs Knowing what I know now about all those things I can see that if I and all young people had been provided with quality education about those things by adults our teenage years and relationships would have been a  lot less scary frustrating hurtful etc  When I was in college I studied abroad in the Netherlands and discovered that the Dutch college students all seemed far less troubled and damaged by sexuality alcohol drugs and relationships than us American kids They were confident They had clear preferences and boundaries Most drank and used drugs in moderation Some could get very drunk but usually because they just over did it while having fun not because they were trying to use alcohol to escape pain or sorrow The difference I believe is that all Dutch kids get  Comprehensive Sexuality Education   starting at age  and continuing in age appropriate ways through high school They also get education about alcohol and drugs that is oriented towards healthy use and harm reduction rather than abstinence and prohibition  All that is to say that when I watch your film all I could think was  Where are the responsible adults in America   The Dutch adults have been providing their young people with accurate timely and empowering knowledge about sex alcohol and drugs for    years When they hell are we going to catch up in this country so that the only self reflection films our youth have to make are about good times that were consensual and safe Kids in this country are growing up in a barbaric kind of informational stone age and getting  predictably hurt as a result This needs to stop  
Feminism,1615582152,My mom has articles written about her work in nursing and I remember this one time the journalist wanted her to pose for a picture with a doll She was quite pissed off and refused to hold the stupid thing 
Feminism,1615581671,I think a major problem is the way the world percieves femininity Masculinity is seen as strong bold and powerful Where as femininity is seen as weak and frivolous This view of femininity is perpetuated in order to keep woman subservient to men We need to re brand feminity as equally bold and powerful in it s own right in order to move forward But men will always see femininity as weakness because they want to keep us subservient to them 
Feminism,1615579715,This is completely to blame on the older generation A man being attracted to a woman is never a bad thing 
Feminism,1615578887,Worth pointing out that a police officer is in custody for her murder We re told ad nauseam that we should trust the police 
Feminism,1615578852,Good intention and maybe the comedic approach would be a selling point for some It  is regrettable that he used ableist or misogynistic slurs though 
Feminism,1615632891,I just googled it because I was guessing it was the fuck with Lol 
Feminism,1615632750,So it s not about me being a man in the same way that the act of mansplaining this thread is about wasn t actually mansplaining because that person didn t act this way because he was answering to a woman  You see the problem here I hope
Feminism,1615632734,True How can you possibly be entitled AND make all of this about yourself Nobody ows you an explanation  chill Way to overestimate your own importance 
Feminism,1615632615,This is real feminism And this has no likes compared to some stupid twitter comment  
Feminism,1615632527, I don t understand because I m a man I can t argue with a woman     That right there was the leap I m referring to You went right for the victim trope when you aren t a victim here It s not about you being a man in this case
Feminism,1615632525, gt I guess I ll be remembered by you guys as the man who mansplained feminism No Good bye 
Feminism,1615632500,That s the kind of answer that a person says when they have nothing intelligent to say   
Feminism,1615632419,just unfriend her honestly you ve tried your best to educate her and if she refuses to listen then it s her fault we don t associate with people like that 
Feminism,1615632400,Dude no one owes you an explanation or any argument whatsoever 
Feminism,1615632291,Yes but I was asking a question to a person not r feminism unless the person I was asking it to represents feminists   Tryinh to make it seem like ppl are out to get you simoly for being a male  feels like how a man would react to a woman calling out his bullshit
Feminism,1615631508,All she said was to redirect your questions to the sub that is meant for asking questions    They do that with everyone who posts questions that may need detailed nuanced answers You re making this way too deep and trying to make it seem like ppl are out to get you simply for being male Not the case
Feminism,1615631460,Wow didnt know about this sub but you people are legit crazy This is what feminism is about these days huh 
Feminism,1615629974, gt Are they just trying to excuse their misogyny by bring in  female privilege  Usually that s what it is  gt Would that not be equity  It would be equity to accommodate everyone It s oftem not anyone s fault for them not being incapable of meeting standard Some people train and try as hard as others but don t make the same progress some people aren t as strong or as fast as others and that s okay But we don t accommodate for people To use the example of wider hips a male who happened to have wider hips  they exist wouldn t get a shorter run time He makes the standard or he s kicked out  The organization is meant to be practical they say that  Uncle Sam says if you can t do   pushups you re not good enough to do your job and you re out  Meanwhile   pushups is enough to be good at your job if you re a female Many people see this as a double standard It literally is a double standard Most jobs in the military aren t directly combat related there s admin logistics mechanica etc etc Fitness requirements are mostly redundant for these roles anyways but either you re strong fit enough to do these jobs or you re not To say that men need to run  random ish number a   minute  mile run to be effective in battle and woman need to run a    mile run to be effective in battle is ridiculous Reality is the same for both  gt But muscle mass and running speed are not the only aspects of being a soldier and even if they were women have proven to be just as capable as men in those area If that were true then the military wouldn t have different sets of fitness standards for males and females The different standards exist to reflect biological realities and make sure the fitness tests are mostly fair  Infantry  combat arms do a lot of walking  sometimes    miles with heavy loads  well over  pp lbs of kit on top of their own weight  This is enough to cause fit men who exercise regularly to devolop lifelong knee back pain Most men can t do what the average infantry soldier does  Having talked to infantry soldiers a concern I ve seen  is that the standards for them change Whereas before if you couldn t complete one of the hikes in training you failed now you can fail  of the  so long as you pass the last one This change coincided closely with women being allowed to enlist as infantry  I support women in the armed forces and I also support having multiple fitness standards  though I think it should be by job and not by gender  Above is just thoughts I guess 
Feminism,1615629949,I guess this subreddit should be called r Bashmen because I haven t seen a single feminist in it 
Feminism,1615629441,I guess that s the least rude comment I ve gotten until now Still I ve not seen a single argument against what I ve said in this thread All I ve seen is acts of condescendence 
Feminism,1615629224,I am not     To all if those who are being rude to me because I m a man you are engaging in an act of sexism meaning you can t be a feminist since feminists treat men a women the same I guess I ll be remembered by you guys as the man who mansplained feminism 
Feminism,1615629000,Let s try again We know you re being deliberately obtuse Please pack your bullshit and take it elsewhere 
Feminism,1615628928,Completely agree  gt I also think parental leave shouldn t be exclusive for biological parents and adoptive kids also deserve the right to have their parents around when they arrive at their new household The only exception I can see is for monoparental families Perhaps the total number of weeks should be the same  E g if in a family of two parents both get  months I think a single parent should receive    And a family with more than two parents should get   in total and see how they divide it 
Feminism,1615628580,How is it blatantly obvious  Because I m a man  I m sorry but I m just trying to use logic so we can have a decent definition of what actually is mansplaining You guys can have different point of views and I d be happy to have a nice discussion about them But I ve been nothing but rejected until now   
Feminism,1615628339,It s blatantly obvious you re not engaging in good faith Get lost 
Feminism,1615628325,Have I said that mansplaining is fake  No some men do believe that a woman is more likely to be wrong about things because of her gender I study psychology  almost got my master s degree  and I know for a fact that the differences between men a women are non existant regarding intelligence But I do think that some feminists are too quick at calling out mansplaining when they see a man trying to correct a woman I m a feminist too btw as I said it is part of my ideology that women are equal to men 
Feminism,1615628284,What s the changing shoes for I get the rest of them but that is new to me  Also I m told the key thing isn t combat effective
Feminism,1615627865,This guy   I d love a body switching movie where he has to be a woman and realize how wrong his beliefs truly are  People talk over MEN too Not every single woman in the history of ever has been right    So mansplaining is FAKE  yeah really got us there  
Feminism,1615627545,I don t understand because I m a man I can t argue with a woman about the characteristics of a concept that s targeting men   Look who s behaving differently because the person is of a different gender now 
Feminism,1615627112,Go on r askFeminists for asking questions to feminists This is a space where feminists come to talk to other feminists Check the rules of this sub 
Feminism,1615626668,So if a man has one information in mind and has confidence in it being true  without it being true and tries to correct another man on something related to that information he s just wrong but if he does the same to a woman it s sexist and it s mansplaining  Mansplaining should only be when a man thinks a woman is wrong  because she s a woman  and nothing else How is this mansplaining  
Feminism,1615626136,Yeah that s exactly the reason we do that That s why a woman could never ever do that That s why feminists aren t taken seriously btw    upvotes   the stupidity is hilarious 
Feminism,1615625544,Sweden has an explicitly feminist foreign policy actually Not     sure what it means or what out government does in practice that is in accordance with being feminist in our foreign policies but just pointing out a country that has done this

Feminism,1615611430,Happened to me during a presentation in front of my   Game school class to present the game we were working on In French objects are gendered the word was  orb which was masculine and therefore used the appropriate pronouns Then a guy in my group thought it would be completely appropriate to cut me off in front of the class in order to correct me  It s actually a feminine pronoun  Teacher steps in googled it   And I was right How hard for him is it to wait until the end of the presentation to point out my mistake Or did he want to play  hero and put me down publicly Honestly this isn t even my first time being disrespected like this sadly   
Feminism,1615611257,The only problem with your entire post is this  gt This community should be a safe place for those who identify as women Why are you implying we are not

Feminism,1615610028,Obligatory attempt to be banned from this shithole of a sub The abuse on dairy cows is not exclusive to female cows and should not be considered discrimination The male cows are not treated as females cows because they lack the natural bodily functions required to perform the same tasks and create the same resources Female cows are taken advantage of because of evolution not because of their gender If male cows could generate milk they would be taken advantage of the exact same amount It s not discrimination it s animal abuse Don t let feminism handle that issue let animal rights handle it 
Feminism,1615609761,The simplest way to explain it for visual learners is it s an experience confidence curve where at the start of doing something you have very high confidence but low skill because you don t know what you don t know Learned this shit on Vsauce I know I m an expert 
Feminism,1615660591,Your reasons are something only you truely know If something about those reasons gives you concern in your very heart of hearts  it would be smart to maks sure you know why you want it and that its a reason you can live with after the fact regardless of the outcome  Personally the only reason I don t get a boob lift or botox  well two reasons  I can t afford either  LOL and I m not sure I d be ok with myself if it didn t turn out as planned Sure  would be easier not wearing a bra  but are the risks worth the expense Yeah would love to have a few less wrinkles on my brow but ack  what if it hurts me instead of getting rid of the wrinkles  Hell  I really want lasik because I am so near sighted that I can t wear glasses It would be nice to be able to wear glasses Argh  but what if    Feminism or  the standard of beauty has nothing to do with my hesitations

Feminism,1615657837,Feminism is about women having options and opportunities free from the oppression and expectations based on the constructs gender Therefore feminism should support women equally whether they decide cosmetic plastic surgery is right for them or not Additionally feminism does not support the subjecting of women into a single paradigm of beauty which is often how plastic surgery is advertised to manipulate women The problem isn t women choosing to get cosmetic plastic surgery the problem is the system that bombards women to believing they are flawed and their beauty is their most valuable asset Furthermore there are many other factors that complicate the topic even further such as dangerous fake surgeons classism in beauty standards racism in beauty standards cultural appropriation rising through cosmetic procedures etc  Each woman makes their her own decisions and feminism supports that 
Feminism,1615656902,but does she know Pythagoras s theorem to the third decimal  s
Feminism,1615656113,One would think having control over your own personage in that way would be aligned with the feminist ideals I certainly don t judge anyone who has the guts to go through that much agony to feel better about themselves  I think many people believe others get elective plastic surgery in order to be more attractive That s just not true for all At the end of the day  being comfortable in your own skin is something we all want Good on them for making it happen 
Feminism,1615655370,I m not sure what you mean with  advocating for plastic surgery but I am of the opinion that everyone should be able to do whatever they want with their body  Of course there are several different motivations with not medically necessary plastic surgery and a lot of it seems to be linked to insecurity and or the male gaze  But I wouldn t ever judge someone for deciding to change something about themselves I see it as an act of autonomy and also not giving a fuck about people criticizing women for it 
Feminism,1615650690,You know almost all wars have started because of competition for resources not emotions right I m I don t have to   mansplain  anything to you because you re deliberately being disingenuous 
Feminism,1615650021,you re equating being hysterical with starting wars is kind of a stretch though right
Feminism,1615649264,Wow so you respond with more sexism Imagine if men walked around using a term like say  womandriving  using it to mock women who drive or park poorly This is actually a thing  it used be common to roll your eyes and say  woman driver when a woman drove poorly and you can still see Youtube videos mocking them That would be pretty annoying and sexist right Now imagine if someone complained about that term and someone responded with  If women would stop driving bad the term would stop being used  Sexism is wrong You are never going to win the struggle against sexism against women if you use sexism against men as your weapon You ll just perpetuate it 
Feminism,1615647802,If men would stop doing it the term would stop being used

Feminism,1615643856,It used to be known as  a little knowledge is dangerous  meaning that knowing a small amount about a subject can lead you to think you know more than if you have deep knowledge 
Feminism,1615642957,Everyone should be careful when out alone   no one can tell murderers thieves and kidnappers to stop their crimes but instead we can tell people to be careful to minimize the accruing of such crimes Stop throw it on genders and blame one over another that s a childish  and let s all takes responsibility both men and women to reduce the possibility of it happening more often 
Feminism,1615641750,All those comments    Let me explain it to you It is a well proven scientific fact that men will assume women to know way less about pretty much anything except child rearing clothing makeup    Archetypical fem things  This combined with the confidence that men are taught to have because they feel they are supposed to know everything Results in bad faith interpretation of things women say taking the weakest possible interpretation and trying to explain something to them that they already know But this works also in tandem with the Dunning Krueger effect where men don t know how little they know about a topic  E g feminism and they think So they confidently mensplain feminism to women with no idea what they are talking about Hence so many comments under this post

Feminism,1615640016, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action     
Feminism,1615638756,Agreed Don t have time for shite just cut them off  amp spend time with people you re aligned with It s not  hiding in a liberal safe space  life is just too short to stay friends with someone you don t respect out of a vague sense of loyalty
Feminism,1615638147,people with tendency to abuse are more often than not fucked beyond education though 
Feminism,1615636201, How am I questioning the lived reality of women  I refer you to your first point 
Feminism,1615636142,We change into trainers to walk home so we can run if necessary  Keys may not actually be combat effective but a lot of weapons that we might think would be useful are illegal in many countries 
Feminism,1615635478,So I ll go over your comment point by point Me talking about my degree is to communicate that I know the research that prove that man who belittle do so because they are ignorant nothing more No no one owes me an explanation unless all they do is being rude which is the only kind of reaction I got here How am I questionning the lived reality of women  I certainly am not I was arguing about what is and what isn t mansplaining because this expression was inappropriatly used here imo  No feminist here has been open for discussion as soon as they determined I was a man questionning the nature of the concept of mansplaining  I m almost certain you re gonna learn little from this well you missed my point entirely so yeah not much to learn 
Feminism,1615634592,How can you assess that  feminists are too quickly to call out mansplaining  By your degree Don t you think others on here have degrees as well or what If you do  how the hell does that matter in this context   Completely missed the mark there Feminists are pretty open for discussion and good faith questions Imo They still don t owe you an explanation though  People are upset because you came here not to learn something or to grow but to question and discredit the lived reality of women  Because you are part of the targeted group and it automatically sends you into defensive mode  You arguing about instances where a man legitimately corrects a woman  all while being presented with a very clear example is exactly that That s what happening here and people see right through it  hence the downvotes  Here s what people like you often fail to understand It s not about you  Women don t care about your degree or whether you re a good person We re talking about a  system of oppression in which there s a bias against certain people in this case women  I m almost certain you ll gonna learn little from this but at least you can t argue how much your  critique has been dismissed  even though you re not entitled to a discussion  And maybe some more curious and open minded man will find this and understands a bit more about feminism and its talking points Have a good one 
Feminism,1615682179,Try reading what OP posted ten times Might help Read it aloud maybe  I don t fucking know what to tell you   Maybe if more people with your opinion instead focused their ire and frustration on the men who are letting down the side and less on the people who hold men accountable you might get somewhere eventually  You kind of sound a bit like the type of person who says all lives matter 
Feminism,1615681730,Yes and we will probably never agree I m okay with that but you didn t answer my question 
Feminism,1615681500,I m going to get down voted and called some names I m sure  Why is it not socially acceptable to lump all of ANY other group together but it s perfectly fine to lump most all men together  If I m right most people who will defend this meme would speak out against memes that generalize women  even if it doesn t say ALL women  When a meme or a post says  men are    it s labeling men in general Just like when something says  women are    or  all young people are    
Feminism,1615679858,I used to think ftw was  Fuck the world so I feel you Worked surprisingly well in place of the real meaning
Feminism,1615677550,I think you may have missunderstood my point because I didn t really present it well  I agree Not just on the internet but overall when you start arguments when you are emotional it is unlikely that anyone will leave the argument with a changed view I didn t defend emotional responces I just think that topic like this will easly get poeple to act defensive as something about them is being criticized 
Feminism,1615675820,I am arguing in good faith I am not being the least bit aggressive If you don t want to argue with me that s your right but my points stand 
Feminism,1615675159,no one of the rules is goo faith you are vary much not making any points in good faith and are being aggressive so I am not going to argue with you 
Feminism,1615673552,Gee didn t see that comment coming No I didn t  mansplain anything And your comment does nothing to refute my argument  I didn t refute the idea behind  mansplaining being sexist toward women either I said the term is sexist Please read my comment again 
Feminism,1615671198,Same as when trump implied Mexicans were all rapist s or when racists accuse all minorities of being criminals   It s obvious they don t mean everyone of them are all those things  Why don t people get it Not  notallmen is so stupid it s obvious it s not all men 
Feminism,1615670502,    ain t so bad I d hint your position to your friend That your only friends of convenience wouldn t hang out with them if you had any other options  amp you don t respect their bigoted world view They ll either change  amp you ll stay friends a bit longer or you ll just go seperate ways next year It s tough if you don t have any other friends but it s not really worth staying in an unproductive relationship for fear of being alone I mean not saying you shouldn t fear being alone but you can t just be hanging out with someone you have no respect for to avoid being alone I d say just spend the year getting shit done then disappear in     
Feminism,1615670036,This is the vigil for Sarah Everard on Clapham Common London UK this evening  A serving police officer has been charged with her murder  He was also reported for indecent exposure the week before   yet he was still at work in uniform carrying a badge  The Reclaim These Streets vigil was organised for tonight which was cancelled today by police citing Covid Restrictions Women went anyway All across the country women are meeting in parks and shining lights into the sky 
Feminism,1615668327,One friend was saying things about another female friend about her being with a few guys and I called him out on it Thank you  It was kinda a great feeling  
Feminism,1615667882,That chart is great ILMAO I would add you re a fucking moron to probably definitely stop talking Reddit is a good example of this syndrome 
Feminism,1615667405,Honestly she would ve been gone a very long time ago but she s pretty much my only friend at current I m moving away to university in     so I m planning to cut her off then at the absolute least
Feminism,1615667331,That s what I try to tell myself but honestly I think she s just a bad person She s so racist that she refused to see me for weeks after going to a BLM protest because I was apparently around  dirty people that are more likely to have covid And same with that she s so solid with that belief she sees nothing wrong in it and doesn t even try to listen to alternative views
Feminism,1615667166,Honestly I ve had plans to cut her off for a while but she s currently pretty much my only friend If I had more people in my life then she d be long gone because she s just so incredibly entitled in her view of the world I m going to university in     so my plan is to  drift from her then as I ll be moving away
Feminism,1615666556,One man with the wrong intentions is enough men to be afraid Well put 
Feminism,1615666526,Once I argued with my mom about how woman should be prepared with enough self defense to everything evertime and she labeled me as a misogynist And I feel so foolish and wrong about my past self And I despise even the people who inherits same opinion as my past self but I despise even more the people are sexist and blaming victims  Just remind your sexist friend that there are people out there who is ready to go rape or murder but they just cant do in public because of laws and afraid of being caught more than doing it and this is not okay or normal either We are not in a jungle with wild animals anymore so why we should fear to go outside at night Even I can be anxious when I am the last alone passenger at night even though Im very tall I avoid to follow woman or passing her without even getting near to not to make her afraid because she can think Im stalking To just emphatise I think about what peoples worst act on every possible situation if I were woman because its what society expects to do for woman but its just terryfiening 
Feminism,1615666057,No its not all men But we don t know which men 
Feminism,1615665869,There are an abundance of scientific studies that have been carried out confirming that there is a difference between  men and women regarding what stimuli sexualy arouses them    Do you have evidence to back up what you re claiming   Can you like me some studies please 
Feminism,1615665753,But if it s a social problem we need to talk about it and that ll make all the  not all men men uncomfortable  D 
Feminism,1615663657,Toxic masculinity plays a role alot of comments on Facebook telling men to man up and protect women miss the point entirely Misogyny is so common I hear it all the time Its because something questions their pride or masculinity and makes them violent I think early education is key to make men less misogynist transphobic and homophobic 
Feminism,1615663315,Well if feminists would just stop saying things like  all men  or  men are trash  or  kill all men  maybe men wouldn t feel compelled to correct THOSE logical errors

Feminism,1615661615,when you mansplain why mansplaining is sexist against men in a feminism subreddit on a post about why mansplaining is sexist against women 
Feminism,1615660717,Wow that example O o  so overconfident and not knowing that China is in Asia damn   
Feminism,1615716957,I think you coming in to comment on a literal  not all men post about how you feel as poorly treated as a marginalized group of people  who again let me remind you were sprayed with high pressure fire hoses for asking for equal rights in some of their lifetimes because a woman called men around you not perfect on the  feminism subreddit speaks volumes to your perceived victimhood Like you realize the  enough men OP was talking about are rapists and murderers and you re in here like  awh they aren t so bad you shouldn t be that upset by it  Rape is shit and people who stick up for rapists are shit by extension even if it s passively and through whattaboutism 
Feminism,1615716627,I doubt anything you or your man bun profit could say would sink in any deeper than what I witnessed as a child I also doubt you or him have done as much real work helping actual victims of abuse  But don t let that stop you from responding with more condescending crap 
Feminism,1615715604,Since it is a feminist forum I am just reading and listening and learning 
Feminism,1615714825,Because it doesn t suit your narrative of victimhood not because it s innacurate 
Feminism,1615714516,Black people are currently oppressed by our government men usually do and have done the oppressing of women Literally not the same thing Deflection much 
Feminism,1615714290,I am guessing that it might sink in with you if you hear it from a man  Listen to what Chris Hemmings says about  Not All Men   The dude goes into schools and helps young boys to understand so it should help you too   Link  
Feminism,1615714130,I dunno mate   which parts don t you agree with That black people are marginalized based on their skin colour in a society that in their lifetime turned high pressure hoses on them for asking for equal rights That men are treated better by a society that has been set up to favor them for hundreds of years That comparing the two groups as being equally marginalized is as abhorrent and privelaged as it gets Every time a dude does this kind of shit a Ben Shapiro gets his wings 
Feminism,1615713751,No I just want you to tell me how those two statements aren t equally abhorrent  You know if you can take time away from your empty self righteous posturing 
Feminism,1615713365,Ohhhhh do you want a pat on the back Still doesn t make your comment less stupid
Feminism,1615712995, gt so why can t you just done this one small thing to make them feel more comfortable  Jesus how many other  small changes do you want us to add to the already large pile of  small changes women have had to make for the fragile male ego Whether  all men or not are sexual assailants I m confident to say yes all men when it comes to this ridiculous entitlement 
Feminism,1615712908,I did read it It was full of completely unfounded and totally inaccurate slander  And nothing more 
Feminism,1615712767,Lovely  More ad hominems  How many hours have you volunteered rehabbing homes for transitional housing for victims of domestic abuse 
Feminism,1615712633,It s a difficult one though The overwhelming majority of men aren t doing stuff like this and to see all these posts generalising the actions of a few as the actions of all is not okay You wouldn t say not all Muslims are terrorists but a few are so we have to be careful of all of them  that s just racist   
Feminism,1615712442,Sounds like you re the one with the hurt feelings  You know nothing about me  Not a single one of your assumptions or accusations is even remotely true which is to say they d all be incredibly offensive if I were inclined to respond with an emotional tirade on par with yours Still nothing you said explains how those two statements aren t equally abhorrent 
Feminism,1615712401,But they prove to us time and time again that half the population   are  usually a threat 
Feminism,1615711701,Lmao who gave this douche an award for his smooth brain take 
Feminism,1615710723,Black people are given poorer medical care have fewer rights are killed because of their skin colour have a very recent history of being literal slaves and their votes are suppressed by white people Yesterday was the anniversary of Breonna Taylor s death a woman shot dead in her home by white police who faced no consequences Men get treated better Men have more privelage higher wages more expectations of equality more opportunities less  not non existent but less expectations of physical and sexual violence against them less blame or consequences for physical and sexual violence to name a few differences Look at the fact that you just threw out a victim card the second you weren t considered perfect and better based on your gender while a woman was trying to make a point Poor me I m not considered better than for five minutes I d better insert my opinion to prove I actually am better than while comparing myself to a marginalized group of people for the pain I felt at not being considered perfect and special during this exchange And before you go there I m a hispanic guy I m just done seeing  not all men try to detract from women s movements because it means men have to stop being special for five fucking minutes so yeah all men Men are trash I am trash because I have to be associated with people like you who can t see women asking for attention and help without pulling out the victim card and saying  b but my feelings are huwt on every post where a woman feels like a second class citizen because she s treated like one Next time your feelings are hurt instead of posting try stepping outside of yourself for five minutes to answer the question why someone might feel a certain way about something if you can t immediately see it Chances are it s because they re being treated in a way you can t and don t have to imagine because of the privelage of being not treated that way so trying to detract from that with weird dogwhistles or whattabouting isn t going to improve the situation for anyone and you re just making an ass of yourself and the rest of  all men  
Feminism,1615708539,If they were so mad maybe they should start getting mad at the rapists and misogynists instead of the women being raped and treated poorly for their choice in words and maybe that s the whole fucking problem  a former  not all men douchebag
Feminism,1615707391, gt No it s not all men But we don t know which men How is that any different from   No it s not all blacks But we don t know which blacks  
Feminism,1615706373,If you aren t part of that  all men group then speak out and talk about the issues and crimes committed against women daily Excluding yourself from the problem will not make the problem go away  
Feminism,1615704985,And it bothers me when someone says  not all men since they are immediately pushing the attention away from the real issue just because they feel uncomfortable by a statement People seriously need to stop jumping to conclusions and think for a sec 
Feminism,1615704931,You brought a really good point because I get the impression that at least here in the West some people accept more easily this prejudice against Muslim which is abhorrent  I say this as a guy that also had a prejudice against Muslims and took some time to change myself   Returning to the topic I find the thinking of this topic kind of disturbing and even hopeless if you think that almost half of the world population is male and you perceive half of the world as a threat to your life you are doomed   This thinking is not only bad to the male but to the female too especially those who had traumatic experiences 
Feminism,1615704304,In that moment give her quite a bit of space Cross to the other side of the road if you like make it clear with your body language and gait that you re just a person trying to get from point A to point B and have zero interest in her  But if you want to help women feel safe you can also try to make the world a safer place Copying an older comment of mine    gt You can educate yourself I d start with the book Sexual Citizens    gt    gt You can get involved in local politics and advocate for more effective legal frameworks to fight abuse and assault    gt    gt You can donate and volunteer for nonprofits that provide resources for battered women    gt    gt You can call out sexist beliefs and behaviors in your friends and family    gt    gt You can as an everyday practice  be aware of how you might be impacting women      gt    gt You can teach your children especially boys about how to be effective allies    gt    gt These are all starting points for ongoing efforts It isn t something you can do for a day or a week and then declare victory Learn give and lift as you are able    gt    gt  Here s a discussion   on another subreddit that I think you will find informative 
Feminism,1615703625,Yes when you advocate for that kind of thinking you indirectly make it acceptable in other situations too Now progressive people will say that it s not the same when it s applied to a minority or oppressed group and rightfully so But the thing is we don t all agree who s the victim and who s the oppressor Both TERF and the superstraight nuts think they are oppressed by trans people Fascist believe jews are the oppressors and immigrants are invaders and so on If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor Surely no fash believe all jews control the media or whatever 
Feminism,1615703029,Yeah its a bit of a sticky situation because I know the intentions of it but it still hurts I am a muslim and it is as if someone would replace the word men with Muslim and with the controversy of hijab and burka ban s going around in Europe it just does not make sense to me Its so discriminatory
Feminism,1615702971,The language is illustrative that the generalization is already happening Rape and harassment is just that common of an experience that we first prepare ourselves for the worst It s normal if it makes you uncomfortable If you are ever walking in a dark street and there s a single woman she WILL be aware and take precaution  cross the street have her keys ready so she can drive off etc   If you invite a woman over to your house for the first time she WILL tell her friends your name  amp address just in case Her father and brothers WILL be worried when she starts dating you It s nothing against you I m sure you re a nice person but until she gets to know you there s a real risk for her 
Feminism,1615702479,Let me try to you all think about this point by just changing the subjects   Most of the crimes here are committed by black people I was robbed several times not even one of them were white or Asian or another thing then black and I m even black too my direct ancestry were slaves and indigenous   So I could say I don t know which blacks are criminals or no if I m walking alone and see a black male I ll presume that he is a criminal and take care       No its not all blacks But we don t know which one       One black man with the wrong intentions is enough men to be afraid Well put         I don t agree with this and I don t find this thinking fair I prefer to presume that all blacks are innocent and decent men just like me until they prove contrary

Feminism,1615697691,If you want to compare this to the race situation the true analog to the criticism of men would be the criticism of white people not of black people At least there people are starting to realize that we re talking about white people as a monolith and not every individual white person so we don t have hashtags like  NotAllWhitePeople floating around 
Feminism,1615695174,Women  We are fearful of men and with good reason  You  Well that s just hurtful What about men   
Feminism,1615694434,No because the proportion of men versus women who are rapists is much higher      percent  And rape is way more common than murder Most of us know a rape victim 
Feminism,1615693890,This problem can so easily be solved just by using a qualifier Say  some  or  too many  Anything It s literally that simple You know by this point that a lot of men  notice the qualifier take issue with being overgeneralised as rapists and misogynists so why can t you just done this one small thing to make them feel more comfortable 
Feminism,1615691013,Ive said this before didnt know she said it too Thats cool great actor too
Feminism,1615689484,Don t spread bullshit that s not true If you re sexist just say it 
Feminism,1615689219,Men are not saying that she should have been careful from my point of view From what i ve seen it s men getting told that they are the problem which is generalising and doesnt help the situation
Feminism,1615688654,I do believe it s all men All male humans are socially conditioned  whether they realize it or not to be ignorant of women s minority position in society and their passive or aggressive complicity to th issue 
Feminism,1615687276,basically the same thing as saying that all black people are killers because      of americans are black and      of americans who got arrested for murder in     were black  which makes it statistically  x as likely to kill someone if you re black 
Feminism,1615686021,A downvote No explanation or comments You are up your own asshole 
Feminism,1615684891,Because other  groups of people are much closer together  groups  meanwhile the   sexes group that accounts for nearly     of the humans on earth also seems to have the biggest difference between groups Testosterone and Estrogen create much much more differences in people than Italian and Chinese blood could ever  So naturally people are gonna lump them together until the day they die Doesn t mean all of the criticisms found by lumping people together just because they are M or F is bad But stopping there without understanding the full context of a human being and simply saying  boys are bad because they re men will always be circular and invalid logic 
Feminism,1615682314,You are the problem Far too fragile and far too prone to digging your own grave 
Feminism,1615740158,As a straight white male ally Atleast in the southern states I can say men do not hold men accountable That s personal experience but I stand by that statement 
Feminism,1615739896, Calling out   blaming Yes all men should be called out to do better because we can and we should  If you re doing everything you can that s great   Keep it up  And make sure to hold those around you accountable as well If you re doing everything you can then you shouldn t feel personally attacked by this  It s literally as simple as that 
Feminism,1615739759,Yes This tweet and many of the replies are broad brushing men 
Feminism,1615739588,Yes Some of us do This tweet is using a broad brush and I don t think that is helpful to affecting change 
Feminism,1615737847,Just listen When you do hear or notice something speak up And if you don t then just listen 
Feminism,1615737801,Nobody is blaming men as a collective here  I am a man if you think this is post is calling you out it s because you re part of the problem 
Feminism,1615736738,I m gonna go ahead and say the intervention part isn t true I had a friend who casually told me a story about how he basically sexually harassed a girl and when he was called out on it his only response was the get mad and defensive I m gonna go out on a limb and say most of the guys with these tendencies towards women will not react well when called out even by men This isn t to say it isn t men s jobs to call out toxic behavior just wondering how we can realistically correct it if the people perpetrating it don t want to hear it 
Feminism,1615736102, When  in   men are shit and the other  do nothing they might as well not fucking be there  is a quote I think about a lot

Feminism,1615735147,Pretty sure women are more likely to be assaulted by a friend or family member than by a stranger 
Feminism,1615734147,It basically tribalism     people stick  up for those they feel empathy for whether they be men or women or animals I do agree though that women needn t be trusting of men who are strangers It s  simply not worth the risk So if this makes them unfriendly then so be it They needn t bother 
Feminism,1615733456, gt then why aren t all men helping women in ways that would lessen the violence women face That s my point The OP and many others like you demand that literally every single man act in a certain way That s absurd There are many ways to effect change and support without following your demands  gt Misandry does not even exist Yikes  gt I just know you re racist in the way you refer to black people as  blacks as well as stereotyping Muslims as terrorists Honestly I can see why you would say this because it does feel a little rough coming off the tongue But the verbiage has been very fluid over the recent years and there really isn t an accepted term yet People of color colored people black people blacks African American etc all offend someone for some reason Know that I acknowledge that but saying I m a racist because of that is a way to try and dehumanize me so you don t have to address my argument or simply ignore it as invalid The Muslim thing was also part of the point I m making Reading comprehension will tell you that I don t believe Muslims are terrorists The statement is terrible and very bigoted However I simply crafted it using the exact language of the original post to make a point This tweet OP basically says  all men are the problem in some way  How would that read about blacks whites Muslims women etc  etc 
Feminism,1615733421,It s  very counter productive to blame men as a collective Most intelligent decent people will not tolerate harassment 
Feminism,1615733207,Probably not  all       but  many  Feels like a some kind of competition or a revenge on men honestly To make such broad and stupid assumptions Maybe women should hang out with more men Feels absurd to read these threads as a man who doesn t witness that much harassment in social circles nightclubs or such environments And if it happens it has instant consequences

Feminism,1615730693,Too little too late I woke up a few days ago to check my social media to be attacked by    of people that I use to call friends People posting stuff saying  all men are responsible all men are complicit  Because of  what some sick psyco did to some poor woman in London It is not my responsibility for what some random stranger does Period I know who I am and I choose to spend my time with good honest people I don t need to influce the  bad men because I don t spend my time with those kind of people It is not my responsibility what strangers do I was lucky to be brought up by an amazing single mum that taught me right from wrong She is a saint  It is not her responsibility for what a stranger does I was a feminist until a few days ago Feminism has lost a good ally And I can t be the only one  I want to thank a lot of friends that targeted those kind of men in their posts And didn t attack and blame good people    Feminism and any other political activists don t do enough work to stamp out their respective extremists It s those extremists that make people lose faith in that cause The exact people that you actually need on your side The irony  I no longer consider myself a feminist I will continue to do the right thing and campaign for change but I will not do it under the label anymore  Seriously fuck you  Don t waste your time commenting on my post because my notifications are turned of
Feminism,1615730691,I ve seen it in my group of acquaintances  I m very deliberately not calling them  friends   Some of them are fairly decent when talking one on one and almosr none are ever outright shitty when talking in front of the girls but when it s only the boys around it s open season for all the misoginy body shaming and anti feminism imaginable  And the less shitty more reasonable among them are dragged along as well because you want to fit in On the other hand any criticism is met with open resistance from the ringleaders I ve distanced myself from them I ve come to the conclusion stopping them or reasoning with them is out of my reach and only further fuels their narrative I try to keep touch with the ones I consider my friends still to keep them grounded away from that extremism I m not saying this is always the case but it s heartbreaking seeing previously reasonable people radicalizing and being powerless to do anything

Feminism,1615726703,This touches me deeply I just had a discussion with my brother and dad about this They just don t understand My dad think that he is going to protect me from everything and my brother is focused in not all men They didn t listen when I tried to explain to them that while they don t physically harm women they need to change their behavior regardless of jokes the way they talk to my niece  boys don t cry and stuff and their lack of listening to us women
Feminism,1615726524,They don t exclude portrayal of gender roles but Kelly Reinhardt s films usually subtextually comment on them especially in Meeks Cutoff and Certain Women 
Feminism,1615726495,Hmmm   Replace the term  Men with other religion ethnicity race etc etc And it comes off as being discriminatory as fuck 
Feminism,1615726293,I think a big part of the problem is that the men who treat women like shit often group together and validate their behaviour within those groups I can t honestly say there are any guys I know who are or have been shitty to women  to my knowledge  And that s another part of the problem I don t know how my friends treat women when I m not around It s hard to call someone out on something if I have no idea what s going Best I can do is lead by example whenever there s an opportunity to do more than be passive and hope it s well received 
Feminism,1615725872,As a man with narcissistic tendencies myself who hopefully didn t cause any trauma or anguish but certainly was unstable in past relationships it s very common for me to want to publicly display somehow that I m  reformed and think people will see that and fully change their mind about me I personally have stopped myself every time and realized the moment I do that will be a complete disgrace to the movement and everything I ve learned from it  I have absolutely  sympathy for myself and others like this I just imagine this sort of thing is really common Just another opportunity for men to take over what belongs to women and expect credit and praise while not having to deal with the stakes of it 
Feminism,1615725746,If everyone actually did what they could this would no longer be a problem Maybe you do but maybe someone else dont
Feminism,1615725672,Another redirect See This is the actual problem She raises a question and you go WHAT ABOUT THE WOMEN Taking away yet again focus It s just another way to say  not all men 
Feminism,1615725561,That s the thing the day the men says enough to the abusers it will stop right away If your friend acts badly towards a woman at work and you tell him they buddy I don t accept that kind of behaviour He will literally never do it again the shame to lose face in front of another man But as long as the abusers friends look the other way or even laugh it s consent enough to even make him escalate his behaviour It s obviously not enough with women saying stop 
Feminism,1615725475,I agree still you have to consider that all this information is not reaching the people it is supposed to reach Some random teen encounters part of it gets into a twitter argument with a few trolls and then starts to think that feminism is about hating all men A possible ally is turned into a misinformed bystander and people on the fence are driven towards misogyny 
Feminism,1615725118,Hmm we do what we can to make it safe for the people  we care Unfortunately we can t stand up for everyone 
Feminism,1615724929,Oh have you decided to pretend you were joking because your insistence that your volunteer work makes you more knowledgeable about abuses committed against women than women themselves wasn t working Get the heck out of r Feminism You clearly are not a feminist 
Feminism,1615724699,Valid point but do all women do that too I can promise to you that I m more worried about the effect my mother will have on my niece than my brother
Feminism,1615723881,Sadly I think the answer is no not all men do stand up for women It s one thing to say you believe in equality and fair treatment and another thing entirely to call out your closest friends and family on harmful behaviour Personally I don t know of any other guys in my life who have actively stood up for women myself included if I m being honest 
Feminism,1615723815,I should be able to express whatever I want about my trauma publicly without being bullied and re traumatized If you don t support women healing in the ways they choose to I suggest you leave this group

Feminism,1615721827, the actual victims of abuse I ve worked with have acquired a pretty keen sense of  which men   If true then what you re saying is   women need to just sense which men are bad but also that women who do have this sense are not saved from abuse anyway With that solution being flawed shouldn t you agree that abusive men are the problem not women wary of abusive men 
Feminism,1615721422,Honestly you wouldn t be able to pass any screening I know of to be anywhere near victims of abuse  I m pretty sure the only one pretending here is you  Take your fake outrage and tie it inro a cute bun then fuck yourself with it 
Feminism,1615721176,Yep  It s a sad dynamic and it was a crass joke 
Feminism,1615720969,What the fuck are you talking about I never not one fucking time said anything about any of my feelings let alone the one you just invented  Nowhere do I say anything about feeling like I ve been treated poorly  What an absolute shit show of projection to cap off your entire thread of bullshit you made up and attribute to me I m sorry but I m done with you  If you really want to know my  story there s eleven years of my post history for you to peruse  Go back far enough and you ll find your  whattaboutism   And if when you get there kindly go fuck yourself preferably with one of those hoses you re seem fixated on 
Feminism,1615720427, gt Judging by the number of repeat clients it would seem  which is their type  This is pretty well researched in the field of psychology It s an aspect of trauma bonding a person within a traumatic relationship   abusive harassing sexual violence anything like that   will sometimes become dependent on the person abusing them Which can happen for however many reasons often gaslighting or simply not having a way out   it s safer to become dependent than to completely isolate yourself and to put yourself into a potentially more dangerous situation by leaving You can just google trauma bond if you want it explained in better terms Once the victim of this leaves the relationship however they ll often get into relationships with other abusive people Not because that s their  type   which is just a sickening thing to say honestly nobody goes out of their way to find abusive partners   but because the traits extant on their previous abusive partner that they  fell in love with will also be extant on new potential partners The trauma bond doesn t magically go away when you leave a relationship and if you became bonded to a person who was emotionally negligent and ignored your interests then its easy to become attached to another person who is also emotionally negligent because that s simply what love looks like in your traumatised experience It s also that abuse can decimate your self esteem So you leave one abusive relationship but can often feel like you deserved the abuse or at least don t deserve true love so you re willing to put up with other abusive relationships because at least then you re not alone with your own poor mental state

Feminism,1615753759,Same argument with  not all cops are bad  I think of that particularly after seeing the news about the Met police roughing up the crowd that was there for Sarah Everard s vigil the other night 
Feminism,1615753746,I like the idea behind the analogy but I feel it falls flat because the only real relationship we have with ticks is that they carry Lyme disease while men women relationships are very very complex and it can be alienating to suggest men don t care and or aren t doing anything about women s issues  I think what you mean to say is something like  not enough men  meaning not enough men are calling out abusers rapists etc because it doesn t affect them as much as it affects women This is a message I think  practically all men can get behind The disconnect comes from the fact that men as a whole need to do more but men as individuals feel absolutely powerless to change anything and it s demoralizing to treat men like they don t care on the whole 
Feminism,1615753146,The Bro Code by Barney Stinson a very interesting and useful book

Feminism,1615747797,This this this Generally I fear men far more than I feel protected by them without a doubt They ve collectively traumatized us    
Feminism,1615746719,I don t personally think this is a man vs woman thing For instance I doubt many women have step up for a man when they see their wife belittling them in public Or that many daughters have discussions with their parents about the importance of men s emotional mental well being But that doesn t make all women coabusers  What s going on is called the bystander effect When you are taught cpr you are told that you can t just say  call     to a crowd No one will act You need to say  hey you in the white shirt call      The key is to transform it into a personal responsibility issue Otherwise people of both genders will just stand idly by and watch  So in general we need to create a better society with more empathy and personal responsibility We need to create people who will stand up and act against injustice when they see it whether it be related to sexism racism income inequality etc And we need both men and women doing that if we want things to change It s so so hard as people are wired to be risk adverse and not sacrifice themselves for others So rather than blast people for not standing up we should frame it in a way where we praise the people who do People like to be praised and get defensive in the face of criticism So I think with these types of issues you go with the carrot rather than the stick
Feminism,1615746338,I understand that sexism against women tends to happen more often than against men however if you are really looking for true equality surely you should still be asking the same question about women when there is sexism against men Both are a problem  Would just like to add though that I do still believe every point here is valid however it is unnecessarily targeted at one gender and I hope I don t have to point out that that is the sexism you claim to be against

admittedly the lack of used to be a huge problem within feminism and still is in large parts  It also doesn t bring up anything about how feminism has progressed the discussion about gender in academia something which I suspect is very undervalued In other words it focuses on specifically men s issues that are not related to sexuality race etc The intention is not to say feminism is equally about men as it is for women it does certainly focus on women and is completely fine doing so but the point is that the larger majority of the movement do care and that there is an expanding space within feminism that can and do talk about it Solving men s issues help women and vice versa  though my personal opinion is that it s most effective to do both  The goal is to give feminists an easy

Feminism,1615776292,This is something I have been trying to do   Honestly I catch myself mostly   It just reminds me that it takes continual effort to change 
Feminism,1615776061,Yup I get really pissed when I see an insta post that s like  girls guys   insert stereotype  like holy shit what s so hard about putting  some before it What s so hard about not generalizing
Feminism,1615775871,Yes and I feel as if over generalizing of people  amp groups is the cause of a lot of mis understood issues nowadays 
Feminism,1615775771,Exactly Said it on another post but gonna say it again because these posts keep popping up Not all men is used as a derailing tactic They know what they re doing The more you spell it out for them in posts like these the better their strategy is working We are teaching and wasting energy engaging with dumb arguments rather than actually discussing more pertinent issues Stop humouring them and let s get back to having actual fruitful discourse in the FEMINISM subreddit 
Feminism,1615775719, gt And who are responsible for constantly perpetuating those stereotypes Everyone is responsible not just men Come on this is basic feminist theory that you re getting wrong
Feminism,1615775440,That is a good point I think the problem with the post is it is singling out physical harm instead of just power in general Expanding it to power makes a better point but the tick analogy doesn t cover it very well then It s also is a bit too much of a blanket statement  But it s enough to keep us in a constant state of fear  This is saying that all women are always in fear because of the potential of physical harm from men  I guess the question is who is the target audience If it s meant to show people who don t understand what you explained it doesn t do a very good job You however summed up what it should have said very succinctly I think it s very easy to say men have many different types of power over women and almost all men have abused that power even if only minimally It s much more relatable and less polarizing Anyway I m new here and if I ve come off as ignorant please let me know I m here to try and be less ignorant 
Feminism,1615774979,I don t like generalization I see through the intentions of those people who rush to say  not all men to downplay women s problems But when a person says something bad and adds  all men to it then I really think that s wrong Isn t the point to just get rid of generalization entirely 
Feminism,1615774929,I think when people say  not all men they re trying to call out the fact that some people think  all men are fucking idiots and  all men can go die in a hole  Nobodies saying women should just stop worrying when they go outside in the dark and worry about being sexually assaulted 
Feminism,1615773659,Thank you for spreading awareness you honestly never know who you can reach with this message and how they can become inspired to make a change Here s to collective responsibility for improving women s safety  lt  
Feminism,1615772401,I mean    this isn t an original post they still have guardians in some countries 
Feminism,1615771680,I wish some of them had juuust this much self control
Feminism,1615770462,I just wanted to come here and say that men are not monsters we are humans U guys have created this narrative that men do all the wrong and women are absolutely blameless for their actions While  women dies at the hands of a bad person does not mean all men are responsible for his actions Young men die everyday and as a young man u have a higher chance of dying in the street then women We are not monster stop trying to demonize masculinity Its  women who died why don t we bring up all the wives that kill their husband s and get away wit it 
Feminism,1615770178,It s true that  notallwomen falsely accused men But do all women work to make sure their fellow women do not falsely accuse men Do they interrupt troubling language and behaviour in others Do they have conversations about mens safety consent with their daughters Are  allwomen interested in our safety 
Feminism,1615769706,The difference is about power dynamics and what the agenda is  When it comes to violence against females the group with less power is developing safety strategy based on frequent experiences so they don t continue to be harassed by those in power  The agenda is equality  In the case of refugees the group with more power is bullying the group with less power using isolated incidences as examples The agenda is political power  perhaps sprinkled with white supremacy  Essentially those in power should not abuse their power As a corollary it s vitally important we all recognize where we as individuals are in power and where we aren t A same person can be in different categories for different issues  eg a male refugee is in power as a male and not in power as a refugee We should help him out as a refugee but call him out if he mistreats his wife  
Feminism,1615768995,All people have a duty to work for the betterment and safety of others 
Feminism,1615768959,I think it would make a difference if we started to really acknowledge the mental health and substance abuse issues that contribute heavily to violence against women 
Feminism,1615768817,I mean I m sure there are men I would consider or at some point have considered friends who do those things but they don t do any of that around me I mean I m not really a man but most people only know me as one so maybe it s different for others but I think a lot of times men who do say and do this shit know who among their friends they can get away with being open about that with 
Feminism,1615768758,Kinda late out here but look up the Polgar sisters They re kind of like real versions of Beth Harmon women who made it to the highest echelons of competitive chess 
Feminism,1615767957,Cap I m not a baby sitter not responsible for the shitty behavior of others  Or can an individual woman really not take care of themself    I swear none of you are actual feminists
Feminism,1615767435,Yeah not all men are abusers but enough are that its a problem
Feminism,1615766185, gt He will literally never do it again That s incorrect Is this anecdotal or just something you assume would happen if a guy was called out because that has NOT been my partners  m experience    When he s called guys out for bad behaviour he s been met with denial anger brushed off and laughed at ignored and very commonly gets ganged up on by other guys in the group who also feel attacked because they do say the same shit Any other time he gets along with these same guys really well just not when he s calling them out   My partner sells cars and deals with a lot of sexism and monogyny among the salesmen and mechanics An example of behaviour    Woman comes in to deal with the company for whatever reason mechanics get all excited and start elbowing each other encouraging each guy to try get a look even if it s to go into an area they normally aren t in talk about what they d do to her partner hears it and tells them their behaviour is gross and desperate they laugh and tell him to basically F off he s just emotional white knight SJW etc    Second example Partner was out of town for training along with another dude when they go out for dinner before returning their hotel Not long after partner learns this dude has a GF he sees him on Tinder trying to hook up with multiple girls for the ONE night they re staying there Partner calls him out gently saying  that s messed up     it s been a year and half now and this dude hates his guts still and tries to mess with him   Last example His friends he grew up with used the word  gay to express annoyance disgust boredom etc He decides to call his friend out on it one day friend thinks it s a joke and not serious keeps doing it multiple times until he realised partner is serious sort of stopped doing it for a while before going back to it because he  has gay friends who said it s ok so it s ok  Didn t have much to say when my partner responded back that both him and I are bi and my brother is trans and we re actually not ok with it It s toned down now but it hasn t  literally ever happened again like you want to believe    I m not attacking you or your ideal situation because how freaking great would it be if men DID just need one talking to by their mates before they changed their behaviour Sadly that s not realistic though It takes people a while to accept they might be wrong about their long term behaviour and longer to rewire the brain  especially the older the person is  I mean would you instantly change when    people never had an issue with your behaviour over   years but now one random friend is saying you re not actually the nice upstanding person everyone else said you were 
Feminism,1615765312,That s just blatantly wrong Nobody should be assaulted in anyway and yes women are victims dramatically more often but this type of comment does nothing to change anything    
Feminism,1615764330,I read it it s indeed a cohesive study But the solution in the conclusion doesn t put the blame on the idea of  false perception of female innocence but the fact that gender stereotypes put many of those men in positions where they are unable to identify their own abuse And who are responsible for constantly perpetuating those stereotypes     Gasp   Men did you shot yourselves in the foot and now you want to blame a statistic on women even when your own article concludes the problem is a male made issue unless you want to argue that somehow women were able to perpetuate those stereotypes 
Feminism,1615764053,Uhhh   because we don t care for being harassed assaulted raped murdered etc I know women am I right   
Feminism,1615763947,Plus  speak to your sons Make them a better ally and they ll be stronger men and happier people It s not a zero sum game 
Feminism,1615763844,My book What English grammar   I think you re trying to troll feminism but realising that grammar pedants are a far greater threat  Feminism is cool tho 
Feminism,1615762194,I have a question so why do I always here women being scared of men when it s dark in the streets
Feminism,1615760803,standing up for women didn t stop me getting raped by one I don t understand these rhetorical statements of course not all men are interested in this as not all women are interested in treating other women or men as equal shitty people exist everywhere and it doesn t matter what gender they are 
Feminism,1615760616,says the person who cannot find any counter argument to change my mind of course I have other thing to do than speak with ppl that disagree with me but cannot find anything to change my mind good luck finding gender equality with such methods cause if you can t explain me how I m wrong when I m all ears of course I won t agree with you
Feminism,1615760040,Yes it is absolutely your responsibility to call out sexist comments and jokes towards women not doing anything about it leads to desentisization of sexual assault and rape therefore less likely to take sexual assault and rape seriously which is why women talk about their greviances men don t believe them In the UK    of young women      years old have sexual harassment it s not women s job to fix this it s a problem with men and it is our responsibility to flattern that percentage not taking reponsibility as you said makes you part of the problem
Feminism,1615759940,You re only showing your ignorance Since you re so insulted I m sure you will find something else to do 
Feminism,1615759843,says the person who is straight up insulting me  and no it was not useless I m showing my disagreement based on facts hoping people would be a little bit open minded but I guess insulting strangers is waaaaayyyy more useful
Feminism,1615759691,This is a really good start u LapisRS I wish more men would simply   ask  the way you re doing    You might also listen to the women around you when they complain about things men say or do Or ask those women about it giving them a safe space and making no comments when they answer you There are obvious things that men say and do that range from inappropriate to harmful but there are also things that may seem innocent but make a solid percentage of women feel uncomfortable or unsafe For example a while back I complained to an otherwise pretty forward thinking male friend about how hard it was to find a boyfriend to which he replied that maybe if I smiled more and let strangers approach me I d have a boyfriend Stuff like that 
Feminism,1615759428,And as a woman I can believe that because most men that I ve encountered have been very respectful to me 
Feminism,1615758532,  If you read and understood the comments you would know not to say something so monumentally useless 
Feminism,1615758500,Ok but men don t owe you protection Thats it thats why Do you jump to protect men No you don t 
Feminism,1615758351,ok so you re making the assumption that all men do these things and that s not true  I am an exemple at least no I read only the comments not the responses so I had a global idea of what feminists wanted to say and how they are thinking
Feminism,1615757346,or maybe you didn t find the right partner we all got our ways and there is probably one person there that like the same thing as you
Feminism,1615757343,Probably an unpopular opinion that will kill my karma but I m not sure that all men having a duty to be the protectors of women is feminism This reads more like   th century coverture 
Feminism,1615757265,the username is a pure joke don t use it as an argument and don t think you re smart cause you pointed it out  i m not saying you are 
Feminism,1615757126,Congratulations You ve never had to deal with the men you know in private when they re horny  I m sure you re scrolling backwards through r feminism to be super helpful 
Feminism,1615756956,as a man who was raised among men I can tell you that nobody says that I never heard that in whole my life
Feminism,1615756873,U S Census Bureau which revealed that in      a study of a percentage women and men who admitted to forcing sex found that     per cent of that subset were women compared to     per cent of men     college study of    men and boys which found that   had been sexually coerced into unwanted intercourse with   per cent of the perpetrators reported as being female   toManyWoman
Feminism,1615782474,So you re really saying that women just don t uphold gender roles Ok where does this wild theory come from

Feminism,1615781201,I wonder if we re due for this kind of discussion to remind us all why stereotypes are immoral and undesirable We all grew up being told not to stereotype whole groups based on individuals that prejudice is bad but a lot of us probably haven t spent much time weighing the pros and cons because it is just seen as an obviously awful thing to do full stop Then enough time goes by that someone can openly advocate the textbook definition of prejudice and there are some people who go  yeah you know what stereotypes are actually pretty useful I wonder why we ever stopped using them People are like ticks if enough are bad then it s ok to act as though they re all that way makes perfect sense  
Feminism,1615781167,Black people commit a disproportionate amount of violent crime in the US By the logic of OP s info graphic it would be fair to said  black people are criminals and when called out on it retreat to  well no no no I don t mean  all black people I m just using general language to point out a trend  It s ridiculous Generalizations are harmful We shouldn t make them about men or blacks people or Syrian refugees

Feminism,1615780465, gt This is true though Whenever I am walking in the dark I  am always in a constant state of fear Even it s not dark and I need to walk past a group of men who are loitering there is a baseline fear always  My smart watch will show a sudden increase in heart rate  Ya I see what you mean there It s an odd dichotomy that men can both make women feel safe and also fear just by being present I was picturing walking with my wife This would make her feel more safe However I m sure she would still have some fear walking past a group of men even if I were with her Depending on the situation of course Plenty of food for thought there Idk I guess it was hard for me to identify with the core of what the post meant And then I see comments like some in this thread basically saying that if someone doesn t get it now they never will Well I didn t get it and you helped me understand I know there are people who fight against this and  not all men is a tactic I feel like at a glance it s a damn good tactic for someone who doesn t want to understand Someone who doesn t want to examine themselves gets a free pass because they aren t violent Now if they re not guilty why get introspective Anyway what I m trying to say is thanks for not being dismissive and taking the time to articulate the subject 
Feminism,1615780403,This argument would also work really well to support a lot of really heinous forms of bigotry like anti semitism as acceptable because  in the eyes of the anti Semite the Jews are the party in power and have the control Or poor white people and affirmative action or men going through family court Just because a group thinks they have less power than another group in a particular instance does not make stereotypes and sexism morally acceptable 
Feminism,1615780175,I just don t think so I owe no duty to you unless we enter into privity Also the post was sex specific It assumes either that women need men s protection or that men have a duty to women or both As a woman I don t need a man to take care of me As a feminist I believe in individualism and empowerment via personal responsibility 
Feminism,1615779407,If I did the same thing with the male reproductive organs this whole subreddit would go ape shit
Feminism,1615779365, when  in   women are only out for the money and the other  do nothing they all are out for the money  Wrong quote  Changed men women Changed shit money How is that quote even a aurgment I used the same aurgment with different nouns and verbs It could apply to so many different things and more clear as to why it as a aurgment basis Doesn t make sense So all drinkers are responsible for all drunk driving deaths  No it s only drinkers are responsible for drunk driving  The whole party isn t responsible for the lesser  of fucked up individuals 
Feminism,1615778730,Good idea for a comic and I agree in principle but this is cringe tbh As feminists we really need more affective talking points than complaining abt teenage boys who say  not all men  It s a fine talking point in spaces primarily for women but it s bringing no men over to our side unfortunately Talking about the  in  women and  in  men and other rape statistics I think is a much better way to converse about rape culture We  need better consent education regardless of assigned gender 
Feminism,1615777906,Oh absolutely I used men in my example because I see them get defensive more but you re right in that it occurs from both sexes quite frequently
Feminism,1615777830,Yeah i guess I was also talking about girls too I don t like it when anyone stereotypes generalizes either gender
Feminism,1615777690,Couldn t agree more Most of these arguments can be avoided by just saying   some men do  x  instead of  men do  x   Imagine actually being able to discuss a problematic behavior with someone because they don t feel personally attacked or accused    That being said the  some is often implied and simply not picked up on 
Feminism,1615777524,Yep this Exactly this See also  a few bad apples instead of understanding the huge underlying systemic issue and way too much injustice 
Feminism,1615777200,It s also similar to racist talking points  Replace the  men with any other group and it s really obvious 
Feminism,1615776949,All analogies are just proxies of the actual issues and they often remove the context My point was that comparing  different analogies doesn t always make sense because the context can be very different  ie power dynamics  I agree that for the same issue you may need different analogies to get the point across to different people In this graphic I am interpreting tick bites as an analogy for  all types of harm  physical  amp mental as verbal abuse is still abuse   gt This is saying that all women are always in fear because of the potential of physical harm from men This is true though Whenever I am walking in the dark I  am always in a constant state of fear Even it s not dark and I need to walk past a group of men who are loitering there is a baseline fear always  My smart watch will show a sudden increase in heart rate  
Feminism,1615797935,I think this thread sums it up Stereotypes and prejudice apology is the right wing approach The left wing one is that it s not men as individuals who are the target of criticism but social structures 
Feminism,1615797646,Some issues are very much gendered though and sexual violence is definitely one of them So yes everyone needs better education but this could be interpreted in a genderblind kind of way which would be a mistake  not that I think that s what you meant by this 
Feminism,1615797641,Someone called this sexist and the comment as well  Takes all sorts  
Feminism,1615796812,as I explained in a similar  thread    gt Now  progressive people will say that it s not the same when it s applied to  a minority or oppressed group and rightfully so But the thing is we  don t all agree who s the victim and who s the oppressor Both TERF and  the superstraight nuts think they are oppressed by trans people Fascist  believe jews are the oppressors and immigrants are invaders and so on  If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not  just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor Surely no fash  believe all jews control the media or whatever 
Feminism,1615795220,Aside from a few factual corrections  as far as I m aware men are punished more severely for all types of crime and are more at risk for violent crime although I could be wrong  I m curious as to why the distinction of privilege is significant in this case I acknowledge readily that racial minorities have been and are oppressed by white people as a class I acknowledge that women are oppressed by men as a class in some respects although unlike with race this relationship is much more fuzzy Nonetheless if I am determining whether or not to cross the street when I see someone of a certain racial or gendered characteristic coming why does it matter if the class the trait belongs to is the oppressive or oppressed group 
Feminism,1615794977,So would it be justified for me to distrust all poor looking people or racial minorities because similar statistics exist for their perpetration of crime or not Is it acceptable to judge individual people based on data about their social class if the price of trust is your own safety  I m asking this in good faith this isn t a  gotcha moment or anything 
Feminism,1615794745,I completely agree with this pic but man it s gonna be weird being a cop and still holding these opinions 
Feminism,1615794226,Ticks don t have feelings though Being innocent with to ill intention but being treated as such is unfair It s like saying all humans are murderers because some are 
Feminism,1615794063,Not the same thing  Cops are supposed to stop such things  If I see someone catcalling or discriminating a woman most of the time the best I can do I is voice my opinion Cops have the authority to stop other cops from doing illegal things 
Feminism,1615793897,No With  all men it s  too many men  With  all cops it s quite literally every single last cop because that s what the job is 
Feminism,1615792517,Except it is all cops The ones who do their job properly and follow the rules are still doing something immoral They re using violence to uphold an unjust social order on the behalf of the rich and powerful Even the nicest neighborhood beat cop is doing that
Feminism,1615792188,As a man I ve been bullied by other men for defending women in certain situations I honestly don t even wanna bring up some of the situation because they re extremely triggering  both for me and also women here but all I can say is be mindful of the way men treat women be mindful of how women feel in the moment and be mindful of the dangerous realities that women face every day 
Feminism,1615792106,I m so glad those pieces of shit conservatives got kicked out in WA Biggest loss in history apparently Now we need to get them out of the government and make them obsolete Can t believe people have been supporting rape enablers for this long When will people learn conservatives do not care 
Feminism,1615792105,People have different life experiences Remember that before you judge somebody

Feminism,1615791806,Comparing men to ticks is not a good way to win over people  The best way to refute  not all men is to point out that feminists aren t saying  all men are bad in the first place it s the men who are trying to discredit them by unfairly generalizing and trying to turn this into a purity test  bad men vs innocent good men  Feminists say that some men are actively bad many more are disengaged and unhelpful often going along with the bad guys and that more broadly there are broader forces like masculinity and gender roles which can t be discussed in terms of individual guilt and innocence 
Feminism,1615791507,   Damn you both have some great perspective here I couldn t agree more with everything you guys have said and I support women who think this but just because I saw this brought up somewhere else I thought I d help clear it up here    I should preface that I hate the argument that I m about to talk about its based on racist ignorance and doesnt take into effect the context of America s negative history    People  not just women have been trying to find a parallel to this point by arguing that they should similarly be more afraid of black men because they are more likely to commit crime in their area The difference between the arguments is the context that Black people have disproportionately been forced in poorer neighborhoods and been oppressed in the workforce Essentially the crime comes from living in poverty not being black  e g  a third variable  The context as you said seems to play a particularly large role in understanding these types of social points and the variables that cause the social distress Do you have any thoughts on this I would love to hear anyone s perspective on how this point is isn t relatable to the point about men because I ve been arguing with racist family on Facebook about this these last few days I sure could use more help because their sexism and racism is extremely stubborn and frustrating     A follow up point the argument used against men  may be most applicable for anyone scared to walk down the street in an impoverished area at night As a Brazilian American I always avoid going to certain areas of my city in Brazil because they have more crime These areas just happen to be the poorest areas I by no means hate poor people though similarly to how the argument against men doesn t mean that women hate all men There s just strong information that informs our actions to be careful in these social situations    Even though the point above and the point about women fearing men seems fundamentally the same there is a huge difference again it s context The situation with poverty can be changed much faster than the situation with men this is because of how the situation with poverty has been constructed differently If the government just heavily funds these poorer communities we can simply eradicate these criminal differences without the need for more policing which leads to more unnecessary death I don t give a shit if people think my idea is socialist BS  most Brazilian family hate me for thinking this way  they can suck my socialist butt The situation with men cannot be fixed that easily I hope that all made sense I m tired af writing two   page neuroscience research papers studying for exams and barely getting by financially Life honestly makes me so depressed and exhausted but you all make me feel more confident that we re moving in the right direction

Feminism,1615790637,Okay so the way I look at it is that rather than criticizing men focus criticism on male socialization behaviour So directing anger towards the systemic patriarchal structures that foster toxic male behaviour rather than the general male population That being said I want to clarify that when women make the decision to avoid be guarded around men it is not the same as prejudice Prejudice is hatred or discrimination based on affiliation with a  harmless group while being wary of men is based on the very real threat that they pose to women

Feminism,1615784296, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action

Feminism,1615804720,This   This doesn t reference any particular group of people as being the source of the problem This was not an attack on men 
Feminism,1615803224,Gotta say if the feminist group wants more men then why not change the language from  men are rapists to  too many women are being raped  It s understood in both that it s mostly men who are raping women but the second one has a better chance of getting normal men to join the cause
Feminism,1615802737,Not sure if you read OP s question before it was but he specifically asked  how is this  it s not all men but we don t know which men different from saying not all black people but we don t know which black people  I provided examples on how it s not the same and how that felt like an obfuscation and a dogwhistle Comparing yourself to a maginalized and oppressed class when it s convenient to spin a narrative while ignoring the systematic injustices against said class versus the systematic advantages to another to smokescreen and counter an argument that men commit violent crimes against women and try to whattabout the argument into race baiting nonsense is really scummy to do on a board about women s issues and the amount of mental gymnastics required to say  you aren t allowed to talk about your safety or the danger men pose because it s akin to racism is absurd As to your point nobody is going to ask whether or not crossing the street to avoid a man is racist if that man is black versus white except for people fixated on that person s race so your scenario is a bit confusing Are you implying a woman who won t cross the street to avoid white men but will cross the street to avoid black men and women Yes that s racist  If a woman crosses the street to avoid a man regardless of race she s doing what society expects of her to  keep herself safe as it always comes back to when a woman is harmed  She should have been more aware of her surroundings she should have dressed differently she should have crossed the street when she saw someone approaching her she should have blah blah blah and other ways it s not the man s fault for harming her but her own fault for existing But then people want to say  not all men  despite it being a woman s fault for not suspecting it could be all men It s an absurd circular argument that could go round and round forever and everyone is tired of hearing it So to me and a lot of other people it s all men and that s not an issue of privelage or class it s a societal mandate issued by the government who refuses to prosecute men for their behaviors and teach women how to be afraid rather than teach men not to be abusers Women must keep themselves safe because the answer from policing and government agencies when they don t is  she should have suspected all men and acted in accordance with that

Feminism,1615800899,I think the analogy is really powerful At first I thought it was dehumanizing but on second thought I realized it really wasn t it wasn t blaming men or comparing men for ticks it was just explaining the mindset of women who suffered through interactions with toxic and predatory men BUT it s so hard to realize it sometimes I understand that it s not a real comparison but It s kind of triggering to think you re being compared to bugs given that dehumanizing campaigns around the world have compared other groups to insects

Feminism,1615838879,He really is this is literally his one flaw He has reasons with it though He s protective because past girlfriends have seriously hurt him and have done awful things to him He had a girlfriend who would rub it in his face that she would stay up late face timing other guys He has trust issues and believes more risqu clothes should be reserved for only intimate partners I agree partly but I also think people should wear whatever they want as long as it isn t straight up nudity

Feminism,1615824243,I was a teenager when riot grrrl was happening While I was interested in the music  like Bratmobile Emily s Sassy Lime L  Babes etc and the zines  and made zines myself  I didn t find it to be a diverse movement  i was a black teenager in the suburbs who d heard about riot grrrl on MTV and Oprah oddly enough  Same issues as second wave feminism where black and brown cis trans women were underrepresented and had to make spaces for themselves adjacent to the core movement My feelings about riot grrrl haven t changed much in retrospect but there s been some careful reconsideration of it in recent years One good example was the touring exhibition Alien She which did address some of the homogeneity of riot grrrl by including music zines and art by BIPOC makers

Feminism,1615822971,Would you like it if somebody wrote  Women are disease ridden bugs   
Feminism,1615822413,I see what you re saying but the statistics do demonstrate that      of rapists are men while there are no statistics to demonstrate that nearly all thieves are black people or that nearly all child molesters are gay If we knew that      of child molesters were from a certain group  orientation race  of course we would keep kids away from that group And even if that rape statistic didn t exist if a woman has had numerous experiences with violence harassment from men and so have all her friends I think that s enough evidence of danger to justify that  prejudice  
Feminism,1615821402,It s a tricky subject because you re absolutely right that women are just protecting themselves from a very real potential threat but when it is advocated so broadly as it is here it feels like trying to carve out an exception just for one circumstance When THEY do it it s prejudice When WE do it it s just protecting ourselves What about people who cross the street or clutch their purse around black people or refuse to trust their money to financial advisors based on their ethnicity or protect their children by not allowing them to be around gay people They all think they re just guarding themselves from a very real threat The only argument you could make to those people is to say  No no but my stereotype is true I m right about this group over here you re just mistaken about THAT group being bad  Your point about focusing on behavior and social structures is dead on well put

Feminism,1615864420,I m not buying it either   Not even nudity should be inherently sexualized 
Feminism,1615863034,You mentioned that you don t blame guys for this because they grew up with that Implying that boys grow up thinking a certain way  amp I feel like you giving it a negative connotation In you negative experience with someone flirting with you I don t know how pushy the guy was so I can t judge you on your personal experience but if you handled it with an aggressive matter that it didn t match the guys approach then I would consider it fiesty as well But considering you were underage he s a dumbass When it comes to jokes it just depends how much you take it personally I ve had people roast me  amp talk shit but I dont care at the end of the day because their words don t affect me  I don t let it get to me No matter what it is But that s me it just depends how vulnerable you are to things like that I mean if someone has an opinion of you being  feisty it WAY DIFFERENT FROM  ALL MEN SHOULD DIE   Those are two completely different scenarios one of them could possibly potentially dangerous Saying all men should die is threatening it could signal that the person could have a mental illness I mean most hate crimes occur off such word like that  Calling someone  fiesty is not even close to ALL MEN SHOULD DIE  Quite an extreme example Hoodies sweatpants  amp sandals are quite extreme tbh but it doesn t mean that there still ain t some sort of parameter that both females  amp males should follow I mean at the end of the day he s a man Men are attractive to women SURPRISE Obviously if he sees a model on ig he s going to naturally be attracted to it Of course if he s a heterosexual or bi You can t blame him for admiring female beauty But see the difference is models are paid to do their job  amp there job is to look  attractive  I bet that he wouldn t marry someone like that tho because men are very selective with whom they want to be with for the rest of their life So that s where the whole women should act like ladies comes into play Because if your not a model you shouldn t be so explicit That s goes for both men  amp women I mean many men are upset of this feminist movement where they feel like they are being generalized as something they aren t I mean having women generalize that men are rapists violators  amp sex offenders does hurt men to hear because not all of us participate in that horrendous behavior Many of us do put a stop to it  amp call it out even if its with the  boys  Guys know when guys are being assholes some of us do control  amp tell the homies to back off So when you got people coming at you or your type of people it hurts It does affect our gender to have to deal with such harsh claims 
Feminism,1615860218,Dude that s not it at all did you see my other messages  I said I absolutely do not blame guys for this Heck I ve had this conversation with him before and we ve agreed and disagreed He talks the exact way We both blame society for both genders being f caked up Today he talked to me about it the same exact way he didn t change his opinion at all And with school dress codes people took that Too far Why do they still consider knees and shoulders offensive Why is that still a thing And I was defensive back because he started with the defense in some messages previously before the ones in the photos If guys can be defensive we can too Also just because they re  jokes doesn t mean there isn t more behind that Calling it a joke doesn t completely cover everything up That s why jokes are offensive because there is Always something behind it There was a guy who was hitting on me he was over age and I m underage and I made that Very prevalent to him and when I told him off for continuing he called me  feisty because I told him he was wrong  He s allowed to have an opinion but what if certain opinions are blatantly wrong like morally and logically wrong In every way It may seem right to that person because that s how opinions work but what if someone says  all men should die would you like that opinion Would you think that s morally and logically correct Also I said I partially agree with his opinion that intimate clothes should be kept with romantic partners But that doesn t mean all women should only wear hoodies sweatpants and sandals Because that s what he thinks But then he s always sending photos of these girls wearing straight up lingerie for likes and says it s hot   He can t make up his mind I have dealt with this opinion for a while now but I got fed up of him saying it Over and Over and Over again saying girls are all thots and such And him purposely being sexist and purposely upsetting his friends over it for fun when it s clearly a subject that has an affect on our gender 
Feminism,1615859711,Right I agree with most of what you said except for   gt Capitalism may be part of it but non veganism is the real issue You basically answered it below that sentence the only way you get to decommodifying animals and liberating the exploited whether animal or human is by first collapsing capitalism If everyone became Vegan there d still be very poor treatment of animals regardless because of industries that use animals for products however if capitalism falls we are able to start a transition to decommodifying products and necessities if you want to go further we can move to growing meat in labs we have already done it but capitalism prevents us from actually making it something to sell on the market This way you have a transition to a free er and more ethical society

Feminism,1615852984,Yes but in the context of the discussion I think more men would be willing to acknowledge systemic violence against women if those issues were also acknowledged  I think many men see statistics on abuse etc and think of it as something they would never do which in their mind diminishes the severity Educating people about why violence against women is still so widespread can help change their perspective 
Feminism,1615849489,You know mental health issues and substance abuse contribute to violence against everyone 
Feminism,1615848842,I know right he s always complaining about how short girls skirts and shorts are dude WHO DO YOU THINK ARE MAKING THOSE CLOTHES I think it s pretty clear women don t have any input when companies are producing those clothes It s all men He complains about it but loves seeing girls wearing that stuff  Like make up your mind

Feminism,1615848361,I define sexual exploitation roughly as using another sentient being for their sexuality reproductive system or sexual capacity in some way whether by overt or subtle force  One need not actually derive pleasure sexually from the exploitation that they are forcing on someone else  e g farmers in the dairy industry do not necessarily get pleasure from it but they still do it  That definition can be refined but I am referring to essentially the ideal of viewing the sentient being as an object and specifically a sexual one What I mean by women betraying other women women who would themselves be at risk of the suffering I am referring to but still choose patriarchy over doing the right thing Women who do FGM Women  and everyone  who aren t vegan Women who traffick other women  or men or children or whoever is being trafficked  Women who join in on misogyny when they are around male friends   amp  x   B I am not referring to someone sexualizing themselves but that may be a part of it Mainly I was referring to the systemic exploitation of women and especially female animals Capitalism may be a part of it but non veganism is the real issue The solution is a paradigm shift in which women are viewed as legal persons and not as objects and a world in which animals have legal personhood and are not used as commodities in any way 
Feminism,1615848231,He literally doesn t do shit He doesn t care Conservatives need to be make obsolete in Australia or else we will be going around in circles 
Feminism,1615847930,I agree with everything here however I have some questions What do you mean by sexual exploitation What do you mean by women betraying other women In my mind I know what sexual exploitation is being forced convinced that doing something you re uncomfortable with sexually because it s  empowering  however I think there s a difference between someone choosing to sexualise themselves and someone who s actively being forced or persuaded into objectification  With that said I think the only way to solve everything you mentioned is to abolish capitalism once that falls you ll see other oppressive entities falling as well with the rise of socialism 
Feminism,1615847024,We need a name for them that sticks like gorilla glue You need to stigmatize that behavior 
Feminism,1615844417,The main reason that  is used is when generalizing statements are applied to men eg   men are killing women  Although the intent of the writer is probably to say  some too many men are killing women  without that modifier in front the true meaning of the statement is that  men in general are killing women I think that men have a right to defend themselves from statements like the one above that generalize the entire gender Generalizing statements are not really fair when applied to anyone and usually result in unnecessary prejudice and judgement   Not all     are       but enough of them are  is not really a good rebuttal in my opinion You cannot justify generalizations about groups of people just because they may be accurate in some cases Try filling in those blanks with any other identity group besides men and it becomes clear why men respond defensively If a muslim hears    Not all muslims are wife beaters but enough of them are  used as justification in order to group them in with wife beaters they will defend themselves from that prejudicial generalization 
Feminism,1615843216,No it isn t too many More than    of men have never done anything like that You keep defining them by their gender instead of their actions Call them bullies catcallers and rapists but stop generalizing a population of over  billion based on the actions of less than    of it If you want to define criminals by their gender no woman should ever be fit to be a parent because the majority of child homicides and child abuse is done by women But when it comes to them you rightfully call them abusers and murderers instead of generalizing them by their gender Give us the same courtesy

Feminism,1615841754,If he is generally a kind supportive partner then I d be inclined to assume this is just a bit of a blind spot for him and a very clumsy attempt to make you feel less scared  My fiance is a good listener and tends not to give unsolicited opinions on stuff but he has his blind spots and he can be pretty useless emotionally sometimes lol  The important thing I ve found is to just tell him when what he is doing  or not doing isn t hitting the mark For example he tends to just want space when he is stressed out or emotional so his tendency is to give me space  ie basically ignore me when I m emotional  At first I found that incredibly hurtful but over time we both learned that we just have different knee jerk approaches to things so we need to ask for what we want Now when I m emotional or upset and I want to be comforted I just tell him that   I m really upset right now and I want you to listen to me and comfort me  It sounds so ridiculous but it works and he does a great job And when he needs space and I m all up in his business trying to get him to tell me all his feelings he asks me to please just let him do his thing In your case I d suggest you tell him that the way he responded made you feel dismissed and that you want him to be more open to listening to your perspective on issues that affect you as a woman like being afraid to walk alone at night See how he responds to that If he gets defensive call him out on it and bring the focus back to you just trying to be heard and have your emotional needs met 
Feminism,1615841712,This is what I always think whenever NotAllMen stuff comes up These men act like rape is the only issue we care about and that it exists in a vacuum Rape is propped up and encouraged by the things listed in this tweet  it exists within the context of rape culture which exists within the context of patriarchy This is a system that we are all apart of and we have all perpetuated at some point in our lives Solutions come from admitting our faults and working to change the system  not drowning out conversation by shouting about how good and innocent we are

Feminism,1615880706,Because gender and the power imbalance between the genders are intrinsic to violence against women and the reason it is allowed to continue  Terrorism is not intrinsic to islam  its intrinsic to extremist ideals and various other factors   If you dont see that but would rather get upset that we have to share the responsibility of the benefits we receive from a patriarchal society that calls women hysterical when they report abuse refuse to prosecute men because her word isnt enough and then imprison them when they act in self defence I m afraid there is little point in this discussion

Feminism,1615868858,So if I m understanding the question Should people be more afraid in a financially poor high crime area I think we can disregard race but obviously people will use that as an excuse to single people out Violent crime is clearly one of symptoms of poverty but it isn t a limiting factor You don t need to be poor to have power and abuse it I think maybe violence is the most accessable form of power So in a poor community violence or at least the threat of it is a quick and easy way to have power where you otherwise have very little Of course you have the flip side where the powerful can use violence simply because they have power I think the relationship is all other things being equal  which they are not  most men have the availability to exerte power over most women in the form of and threat of violence Maybe poor communities are the same in that regard The greater potential for violence is baked into the society if you will  And well not all fear is rational We are certainly all afraid of things that will do us no harm We are also unafraid of things that can or will do us harm But the the perceived potential causes very real fear Sometimes that fear is rooted in bad things like racism Anyway don t listen to me too much I ve written and this about four times now My points feel week and I m not even sure I know what I m saying But you put some time and effort into your post and I wanted to reciprocate Hopefully this is far enough down in an old enough post no one else will ever read it

Feminism,1615917383,Honestly is not that much different from any other form of fiction Japan has never been specially on the vanguard of feminism equality and many animes are at its core the product of just one person s mind which can be flawed and I believe the majority are men There s also the clich and vicious circle of being written for male audiences which alienates female audiences which in turn feeds the male audience excuses I believe it ll get better as every other media has 
Feminism,1615916098,Actually you re right Thanks for understanding my point as well I was just thinking that since not everyone would actively help someone who gets assaulted by which I mean that if it happens on the street the big majority of people would just turn their backs it s a pretty relevant thing if they actually call the police or help in any other way  But yeah there are also cases in which it s only the bare minimum such as like you said speaking up against racism or correcting a friend for rude jokes

Feminism,1615915316,Or make a nonsense naturalist argument and make silly comparisons to animals  like chimps where males are supreme you know how like people   th century justified colonialism and slavery 
Feminism,1615910985,I agree in some ways and not in others First of all everyone going vegan would result in animal exploitation industries to collapse and move to other alternatives since no one is paying for their services And if a tipping point is reached and not everyone is vegan they may be toppled sooner Whether or not capitalism is also toppled may be irrelevant and even if capitalism is toppled that does not mean that the world will be vegan Most anti capitalists are not vegan and and most discussions about capitalism are done by people currently using animals as resources They are willing to give up capitalism but if asked no way would they give up their animal products The underlying beliefs that animals should be used as resources for food clothing food and experimentation is not necessarily a capitalist idea but rather an imperialist and colonial idea that others should be slaves  might is right  capitalism comes later  Therefore we need to get rid of the underlying speciesist belief first and anti capitalism cannot be divorced from that AOC is against capitalism and she s not advocating veganism as a moral baseline Bernie Sanders is against capitalism but no way would he give up  his animal products

Feminism,1615981271,First of all most developing countries in the world sustain themselves off of vegan staples such as beans rice legumes grains Meat and dairy is a luxury Of course there are some people who simply cannot access any good food at all but that s not a why veganism is flawed argument that s just another way in which our global food system is injust  to animals and to humans clearly  As well we currently have enough food to feed   billion people but we choose to use those crops to fatten up animals whom we then murder  turning them into products that go primarily to well off individuals in the west If we care about the fair distribution of foods globally veganism is the only coherent option Can you go vegan Are you vegan Often people point out someone else s disadvantage as a way to say  well that person over there is disabled poor etc and they can t go vegan therefore I am not going to go vegan  This is illogical and it s also selfish to use someone else s disadvantage to justify your own inaction I agree toppling capitalism would be beneficial but again it s an ideology of non veganism that is the primary issue I agree humans need to be liberated as well but that also translates to  We are humans who oppress and slaughter billions of animals and I refuse to liberate those animals until I have my own freedom  We can all choose to not oppress animals by being vegan and most people can go vegan  And if they can t go vegan there are things that are not related to their diet that they can do not go to circuses not buy pets unless they re adopting not buy fur and leather etc  And yes getting rid of speciesism is a huge step in the right direction because that would mean everyone or most of the world has gone vegan and therefore there simply isn t any demand for animal exploitation because everyone has declared  I am vegan I will not willfully participate in animal use and so all corporations and countries would be forced to change  of course it s more complicated  Again there aren t many anti capitalists who are vegan and those leading the political fight  Bernie AOC in the American case would not further veganism since it s not something they perosnally practise

Feminism,1615968872,I  think that by adding cloths it s not possible to find any solution and that  the solution actually goes in the reverse way to remove them without clothing it s not possible to define what s provocative to wear so the  provocation moves to the behavior that is the best definition And actually when people is full naked  in a naturist nudist environment gender differences blur out and on top it removes sexuality that is the other  driver of inequality 
Feminism,1615967662,Disclaimer I am not a feminist I am all for equality but I do not associate myself with the feminist movement in any regard I just enjoy having discussions with people who disagree with me on contraversial topics Disclaimer  electric boogaloo I also haven t watched JoJo s Bizarre adventure I ve seen the character designs though I completely understand your point of view on JoJo s Bizarre adventure the female characters are complete sexualisation and it s disgusting But the male characters also incredibly sexualised  from what I ve seen there might be some characters who aren t  they re all tall muscular jaw lines and confidant looking in posture and body language Sexualisation goes both ways but from what I ve seen one people will tend to only see it towards their gender When I m watching marvel films for example I honestly don t notice the sexualisation of the female characters but I see the sexualisation in the male characters eg Captain America and Thor Now I completely agree that JoJo s Bizarre adventure is too sexualised but it goes both ways and I just ask that when anyone calls out sexualisation they take a look to see if the both genders are sexualised because most often both are 
Feminism,1615967649,It s called  hetero patriarchy  The vast majority of healthy population want a system based on social justice and that of course includes no abuse nor discrimination However a minority wants to keep privileges and for that it s critical to them to abuse the rest and avoid the logical rebellion  This is very hard to sell as such so the narrative works a lot better when it s sold as an abuse chain  So the   privileged class abuse the     but to a percentage      of that    there is giving the other half to abuse The first half are the men and the second are women To the men is told that to protect their privilege above women they must also protect the   privilege And most men bought it Of course that   also spike it with more stuff like nativism racial privilege etc   but the thing is it s really easy to give to each man a woman to abuse because the proportion is     It s not so easy to give to each male a racial slave So women abuse works very well Then the rest of the narrative it s just for filling in victim gaslighting extremism labeling to whoever points the reality intimidation to shut up and keep playing that impossible to win game etc

Feminism,1615952525,It is not possible for everyone to go vegan there are people who can barely afford basic greens thus are restricted to cheap food Not to mention when you live a life that s stressful like that they won t break away from something that gives them a bit of pleasure Capitalism being toppled means there s more incentive for ethical ways of consuming things like I said the chances are there d be more of a push to have lab grown meat and it would be beneficial to have that since no animals will be harmed  I disagree you can t just get rid of speciesism and go from there it s not pragmatic I d need to see evidence that it is in order to see that as another option of toppling the oppressive society  I think our goal should be to liberate fellow human beings first as long as there s a large power above us they ll make it harder and harder to allow people to go vegan why Because it puts a dent in profit people are addicted already and with busy schedules of the working class most people cannot afford to go into the vegan lifestyle right now

Feminism,1616874278, gt One of the interesting points not illustrated in this graph is that the amount of money an occupation pays is significantly related to the  of men in it Well of course it is it s an average of all jobs whether male or female dominated Of course summing this up will show that men make more because there are more fields dominantly men than there is women and the men in those positions are making more than the women in other fields of work How is that unfair   gt It s that work that is thought to be masculine is more inherently valued than work that s thought to be feminine These issues are certainly related but it s interesting to see how deeply the pay gap is integrated into the workforce Have you done any research into why the gender pay gap exists There s many more variables than just simply men make more Ive  worked in the trades with women who make the same as I do can t produce the same as I do but still are paid the same the same as men who can t necessarily produce the same There are many female dominated disciplines where women are paid very well the same as men sometimes more The pay gap is more complicated than just simply it s not equal men make more than women  Take nursing for example predominantly female paid very well not more or less than men in the field but based on their time in the field to a cap then raises with the rise of inflation the same as their peers Equally governed trades which are    dominated by men women are not paid less they are paid the same but you have to introduce more variables than just masculine vs feminine valued work to get a more conclusive depiction of why there is a   wage gap Search any countries occupational breakdown by gender and you ll see the clear divide of which gender fill jobs more than others and if you understand the major differences between men and women as a whole you ll know why the gap exists we are different in two such ways that s makes us choose certain careers But you also have to take into account simply this     do women want jobs in these fields that are dominantly men most cases no If it was the latter you would be forcing equality of outcome and I don t think anyone wants that in a world where many factors decide who gets a job and the opportunity Women who are firefighters when compared to men make the same amount of money or have the same opportunity to make the same money Not all women want to be firefighters you need to be a certain type of person to work in the field women aren t built for it the same as men biologically speaking they don t have the same muscle mass testosterone aggressiveness   but does that mean for the women who do work in those fields do they get paid less of course not  I just fail to see where your argument and frankly anyone else who doesn t see the clear divide of male dominated work that is more masculine being paid more Well of course because there are more men working in the field so naturally they will be paid more as a collective driving the average up    Is it so hard to believe that Childcare workers for example are predominantly women     and those women are in that position cause they want to be there or dental assistants which make up       How come more men aren t in that line of work I m sure Burly Lumberjack Bill wants to be a childcare worker    no he doesn t because he s aggressive by nature and women dominate those fields because they have more compassion and you don t want aggressive Bill playing around in your mouth There are      Carpenters in Ontario compared to      dental assistants Should the carpenters get paid more than the dental assistants in terms of job not by the determination of masculinity or femininity but danger of the job working in the elements Of course they should and it just so happens that it is a very labor intensive job would a large percentage of the female population do that job    no it takes masculine traits now whether you agree or not the fact is biologically it is a masculine job does that mean that females are inherently undervalued to perform such work No they choose not to do to such work There is an inherent difference when it comes to equality of outcome and equality of opportunity Misreading something that isn t fact and projecting it as something else is not understanding or educating yourself properly on the issue 
Feminism,1616873218,paraphrasing here but something along the lines of  if feminists are so strong we shouldn t let men affect our emotions

Feminism,1615991768,My last sentence where I say my point is that it isn t necessarily from a lack of care is what I was trying to say You hear more people are dying and you think lack of healthcare services discrimination shitty doctors whatever but if the population is growing obviously the rates of death will go up too But on top of that people are getting sicker cases are getting worse so again not necessarily due to a failing healthcare system though in the US it s certainly a contributing factor 
Feminism,1615991328,There s only so many times I can hear acKsHuaLly    in one day 
Feminism,1615990989,I m all ears to hear your  well thought out position about how sexual assault and racism aren t bad 
Feminism,1615990887, gt For me I appreciate devil s advocate in a scenario where I don t know exactly where I stand but I want to press the person to explain more why their position is appealing But this often results in bad faith arguments because the person is arguing a position they don t hold often by claiming a position of authority that they don t actually possess It s much more honest imo to just say  I m not entirely sure on my position yet My concerns with your perspective is x y z  That sort of articulation is helpful in building the trust and respect you describe 
Feminism,1615990855,What do you think sexual assault is Also I m still waiting to hear the  racism is ok sometimes nuanced argument  And the  sexual assault is acceptable when argument  
Feminism,1615990712,How about devil s advocate as a tool to find a more nuanced position for yourself This must be expressed in a respectful way in a context of trust but surely in such a scenario it can be useful to express tropes  which possibly you are inconclusive on to a person in order to allow them to better explain a well thought position to someone less well thought 
Feminism,1615990565,The original tweet doesn t reference  rape is bad it says there can be no devil advocate position surrounding sexual assault or racism So that is to say that in no way is their nuance to be found in how every single person thinks about every aspect of both those concepts Obviously nonsense 
Feminism,1615990365,lol can t argue that i m not a white dude having theoretical discussions however the idea that a white male is not impacted by gender sexism and the discussion surrounding those concepts is total nonsense It s a shame that there are some who would wish to respond to those who take an interest in experience outwith their own as attempting to frustrate them purely because they defend the concept of an honest devil s advocate 
Feminism,1615990187,Right here     Completely and utterly disagree to      Without genuine trust and respect though it is true devil s advocate is useless in any scenario even more so in ones where the knowledge produced is used to oppress and subjugate as knowledge associated with race and gender often is     You asserted something to be devils advocate to the OP Then you backed off of it immediately proving that your first assertion was the  bad kind of devils advocate 
Feminism,1615989974,How have I abandoned the position My position is that devil s advocate CAN be useful Where have I abandoned that argument 
Feminism,1615989741,So    what s the alternate to  rape is bad   racism is bad  Do tell 
Feminism,1615989730,Your first comment completely disagree when discussing racism and sexual assault we  absolutely need someone to play devils advocate    Your second comment playing devils advocate can be beneficial in some scenarios but there s a nuance to it    Pick a lane friend 
Feminism,1615989366,So when you  play devil s advocate  you re quite literally repeating the status quo telling us stuff that we already know  because not only do we too live in this space and time and therefore comprehend the norms of this cultural and historical place but we also are actively thinking outside of that box which first requires us to know that box really really well And you re not so radically reinforcing that we should remain in that box  
Feminism,1615989327,Devil s advocate does not have to be a case of someone asserting themselves then abandoning a position but I agree there are many who do that For me I appreciate devil s advocate in a scenario where I don t know exactly where I stand but I want to press the person to explain more why their position is appealing For example as a kid at a Catholic school the anti abortion message was drummed in quite hard Abortion was something I struggled to take a coherent position on in which I was always comfortable but it was noticeable that the science led of my peers were pro choice To pick their brains without knowledge of biology it was necessary for me to say  It is impossible for you to define logically when is fine to abort and when is not if you ignore the point of conception as that line in order to access their knowledge of the reality of the development of the fetus in the early stages as basically a tiny clump of cells and not a living human being in a womb Without genuine trust and respect though it is true devil s advocate is useless in any scenario even more so in ones where the knowledge produced is used to oppress and subjugate as knowledge associated with race and gender often is 
Feminism,1615988852,No I don t believe these deaths include homicide I ve seen it anywhere from homicide  usually by husband bf lover being the cause of    of all pregnancy related deaths Heart disease being     But numbers may be different now 
Feminism,1615988441,Introducing alternative views sure   but to what end If it s about anticipating counterarguments or adding genuinely needed nuance that s fine but that s not really playing devil s advocate If it s  I m going to assert my intellectual superiority by arguing a position that I don t even hold or that I deny holding when challenged  that s insincere and counterproductive and can do real damage in an organizing context 
Feminism,1615988278,Well as a man I disagree because not all men and blah blah blah  s

Feminism,1616930748, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action

Feminism,1615632615,This is real feminism And this has no likes compared to some stupid twitter comment  
Feminism,1615632527, I don t understand because I m a man I can t argue with a woman     That right there was the leap I m referring to You went right for the victim trope when you aren t a victim here It s not about you being a man in this case
Feminism,1615632525, gt I guess I ll be remembered by you guys as the man who mansplained feminism No Good bye 
Feminism,1615632500,That s the kind of answer that a person says when they have nothing intelligent to say   
Feminism,1615632419,just unfriend her honestly you ve tried your best to educate her and if she refuses to listen then it s her fault we don t associate with people like that 
Feminism,1615632400,Dude no one owes you an explanation or any argument whatsoever 
Feminism,1615632291,Yes but I was asking a question to a person not r feminism unless the person I was asking it to represents feminists   Tryinh to make it seem like ppl are out to get you simoly for being a male  feels like how a man would react to a woman calling out his bullshit
Feminism,1615631508,All she said was to redirect your questions to the sub that is meant for asking questions    They do that with everyone who posts questions that may need detailed nuanced answers You re making this way too deep and trying to make it seem like ppl are out to get you simply for being male Not the case
Feminism,1615631460,Wow didnt know about this sub but you people are legit crazy This is what feminism is about these days huh 
Feminism,1615629974, gt Are they just trying to excuse their misogyny by bring in  female privilege  Usually that s what it is  gt Would that not be equity  It would be equity to accommodate everyone It s oftem not anyone s fault for them not being incapable of meeting standard Some people train and try as hard as others but don t make the same progress some people aren t as strong or as fast as others and that s okay But we don t accommodate for people To use the example of wider hips a male who happened to have wider hips  they exist wouldn t get a shorter run time He makes the standard or he s kicked out  The organization is meant to be practical they say that  Uncle Sam says if you can t do   pushups you re not good enough to do your job and you re out  Meanwhile   pushups is enough to be good at your job if you re a female Many people see this as a double standard It literally is a double standard Most jobs in the military aren t directly combat related there s admin logistics mechanica etc etc Fitness requirements are mostly redundant for these roles anyways but either you re strong fit enough to do these jobs or you re not To say that men need to run  random ish number a   minute  mile run to be effective in battle and woman need to run a    mile run to be effective in battle is ridiculous Reality is the same for both  gt But muscle mass and running speed are not the only aspects of being a soldier and even if they were women have proven to be just as capable as men in those area If that were true then the military wouldn t have different sets of fitness standards for males and females The different standards exist to reflect biological realities and make sure the fitness tests are mostly fair  Infantry  combat arms do a lot of walking  sometimes    miles with heavy loads  well over  pp lbs of kit on top of their own weight  This is enough to cause fit men who exercise regularly to devolop lifelong knee back pain Most men can t do what the average infantry soldier does  Having talked to infantry soldiers a concern I ve seen  is that the standards for them change Whereas before if you couldn t complete one of the hikes in training you failed now you can fail  of the  so long as you pass the last one This change coincided closely with women being allowed to enlist as infantry  I support women in the armed forces and I also support having multiple fitness standards  though I think it should be by job and not by gender  Above is just thoughts I guess 
Feminism,1615629949,I guess this subreddit should be called r Bashmen because I haven t seen a single feminist in it 
Feminism,1615629441,I guess that s the least rude comment I ve gotten until now Still I ve not seen a single argument against what I ve said in this thread All I ve seen is acts of condescendence 
Feminism,1615629224,I am not     To all if those who are being rude to me because I m a man you are engaging in an act of sexism meaning you can t be a feminist since feminists treat men a women the same I guess I ll be remembered by you guys as the man who mansplained feminism 
Feminism,1615629000,Let s try again We know you re being deliberately obtuse Please pack your bullshit and take it elsewhere 
Feminism,1615628928,Completely agree  gt I also think parental leave shouldn t be exclusive for biological parents and adoptive kids also deserve the right to have their parents around when they arrive at their new household The only exception I can see is for monoparental families Perhaps the total number of weeks should be the same  E g if in a family of two parents both get  months I think a single parent should receive    And a family with more than two parents should get   in total and see how they divide it 
Feminism,1615628580,How is it blatantly obvious  Because I m a man  I m sorry but I m just trying to use logic so we can have a decent definition of what actually is mansplaining You guys can have different point of views and I d be happy to have a nice discussion about them But I ve been nothing but rejected until now   
Feminism,1615628339,It s blatantly obvious you re not engaging in good faith Get lost 
Feminism,1615628325,Have I said that mansplaining is fake  No some men do believe that a woman is more likely to be wrong about things because of her gender I study psychology  almost got my master s degree  and I know for a fact that the differences between men a women are non existant regarding intelligence But I do think that some feminists are too quick at calling out mansplaining when they see a man trying to correct a woman I m a feminist too btw as I said it is part of my ideology that women are equal to men 
Feminism,1615628284,What s the changing shoes for I get the rest of them but that is new to me  Also I m told the key thing isn t combat effective
Feminism,1615627865,This guy   I d love a body switching movie where he has to be a woman and realize how wrong his beliefs truly are  People talk over MEN too Not every single woman in the history of ever has been right    So mansplaining is FAKE  yeah really got us there  
Feminism,1615627545,I don t understand because I m a man I can t argue with a woman about the characteristics of a concept that s targeting men   Look who s behaving differently because the person is of a different gender now 
Feminism,1615627112,Go on r askFeminists for asking questions to feminists This is a space where feminists come to talk to other feminists Check the rules of this sub 
Feminism,1615626668,So if a man has one information in mind and has confidence in it being true  without it being true and tries to correct another man on something related to that information he s just wrong but if he does the same to a woman it s sexist and it s mansplaining  Mansplaining should only be when a man thinks a woman is wrong  because she s a woman  and nothing else How is this mansplaining  
Feminism,1615626136,Yeah that s exactly the reason we do that That s why a woman could never ever do that That s why feminists aren t taken seriously btw    upvotes   the stupidity is hilarious 
Feminism,1615625544,Sweden has an explicitly feminist foreign policy actually Not     sure what it means or what out government does in practice that is in accordance with being feminist in our foreign policies but just pointing out a country that has done this 
Feminism,1615625135,boybungling   i thought this would be easier but that s all I ve got 
Feminism,1615615143,Same This hardened porn dude saying he only wants females who have never done porn   He s just so gross and twisted Should be taken off 
Feminism,1615613317,Ah men always getting the wrong pronouns Also speaking of French gendering objects I remember in Y The Last Man when the main character said  French is for chauvinists because you change the  elles for  ils   Kinda like what happens with Spanish with  ellas and  ellos  Weird tangent but yeah 
Feminism,1615611430,Happened to me during a presentation in front of my   Game school class to present the game we were working on In French objects are gendered the word was  orb which was masculine and therefore used the appropriate pronouns Then a guy in my group thought it would be completely appropriate to cut me off in front of the class in order to correct me  It s actually a feminine pronoun  Teacher steps in googled it   And I was right How hard for him is it to wait until the end of the presentation to point out my mistake Or did he want to play  hero and put me down publicly Honestly this isn t even my first time being disrespected like this sadly   
Feminism,1615611257,The only problem with your entire post is this  gt This community should be a safe place for those who identify as women Why are you implying we are not 
Feminism,1615610438,Flip one noun and this whole rotten subreddit will lose their mind
Feminism,1615610028,Obligatory attempt to be banned from this shithole of a sub The abuse on dairy cows is not exclusive to female cows and should not be considered discrimination The male cows are not treated as females cows because they lack the natural bodily functions required to perform the same tasks and create the same resources Female cows are taken advantage of because of evolution not because of their gender If male cows could generate milk they would be taken advantage of the exact same amount It s not discrimination it s animal abuse Don t let feminism handle that issue let animal rights handle it 
Feminism,1615609761,The simplest way to explain it for visual learners is it s an experience confidence curve where at the start of doing something you have very high confidence but low skill because you don t know what you don t know Learned this shit on Vsauce I know I m an expert 
Feminism,1615660591,Your reasons are something only you truely know If something about those reasons gives you concern in your very heart of hearts  it would be smart to maks sure you know why you want it and that its a reason you can live with after the fact regardless of the outcome  Personally the only reason I don t get a boob lift or botox  well two reasons  I can t afford either  LOL and I m not sure I d be ok with myself if it didn t turn out as planned Sure  would be easier not wearing a bra  but are the risks worth the expense Yeah would love to have a few less wrinkles on my brow but ack  what if it hurts me instead of getting rid of the wrinkles  Hell  I really want lasik because I am so near sighted that I can t wear glasses It would be nice to be able to wear glasses Argh  but what if    Feminism or  the standard of beauty has nothing to do with my hesitations   
Feminism,1615658090,I am a zoologist and I will be at the zoo with my families kids because they love going to the zoo with me since I can tell them all about the animals anyways I get mansplained all the time while I am telling kids about different animals it s incredibly annoying  this is a Malayan Tapir it s the largest of the four main species of tapir and the only one located in     UM ACTUALLY THE PLACARD SAYS IT S THE ASIAN TAPIR IT S LOCATED IN ASIA     yes asian tapir is another name for the species   IT COMES FROM CHINA     it actually lives in malaysia or sumatra   NO IT S IN CHINA SEE ASIAN TAPIR  
Feminism,1615657837,Feminism is about women having options and opportunities free from the oppression and expectations based on the constructs gender Therefore feminism should support women equally whether they decide cosmetic plastic surgery is right for them or not Additionally feminism does not support the subjecting of women into a single paradigm of beauty which is often how plastic surgery is advertised to manipulate women The problem isn t women choosing to get cosmetic plastic surgery the problem is the system that bombards women to believing they are flawed and their beauty is their most valuable asset Furthermore there are many other factors that complicate the topic even further such as dangerous fake surgeons classism in beauty standards racism in beauty standards cultural appropriation rising through cosmetic procedures etc  Each woman makes their her own decisions and feminism supports that 
Feminism,1615656902,but does she know Pythagoras s theorem to the third decimal  s
Feminism,1615656113,One would think having control over your own personage in that way would be aligned with the feminist ideals I certainly don t judge anyone who has the guts to go through that much agony to feel better about themselves  I think many people believe others get elective plastic surgery in order to be more attractive That s just not true for all At the end of the day  being comfortable in your own skin is something we all want Good on them for making it happen 
Feminism,1615655370,I m not sure what you mean with  advocating for plastic surgery but I am of the opinion that everyone should be able to do whatever they want with their body  Of course there are several different motivations with not medically necessary plastic surgery and a lot of it seems to be linked to insecurity and or the male gaze  But I wouldn t ever judge someone for deciding to change something about themselves I see it as an act of autonomy and also not giving a fuck about people criticizing women for it 
Feminism,1615650690,You know almost all wars have started because of competition for resources not emotions right I m I don t have to   mansplain  anything to you because you re deliberately being disingenuous 
Feminism,1615650021,you re equating being hysterical with starting wars is kind of a stretch though right
Feminism,1615649264,Wow so you respond with more sexism Imagine if men walked around using a term like say  womandriving  using it to mock women who drive or park poorly This is actually a thing  it used be common to roll your eyes and say  woman driver when a woman drove poorly and you can still see Youtube videos mocking them That would be pretty annoying and sexist right Now imagine if someone complained about that term and someone responded with  If women would stop driving bad the term would stop being used  Sexism is wrong You are never going to win the struggle against sexism against women if you use sexism against men as your weapon You ll just perpetuate it 
Feminism,1615647802,If men would stop doing it the term would stop being used
Feminism,1615643861,The is perfect murdered by words material right I don t know how to link though 
Feminism,1615643856,It used to be known as  a little knowledge is dangerous  meaning that knowing a small amount about a subject can lead you to think you know more than if you have deep knowledge 
Feminism,1615642957,Everyone should be careful when out alone   no one can tell murderers thieves and kidnappers to stop their crimes but instead we can tell people to be careful to minimize the accruing of such crimes Stop throw it on genders and blame one over another that s a childish  and let s all takes responsibility both men and women to reduce the possibility of it happening more often 
Feminism,1615641750,All those comments    Let me explain it to you It is a well proven scientific fact that men will assume women to know way less about pretty much anything except child rearing clothing makeup    Archetypical fem things  This combined with the confidence that men are taught to have because they feel they are supposed to know everything Results in bad faith interpretation of things women say taking the weakest possible interpretation and trying to explain something to them that they already know But this works also in tandem with the Dunning Krueger effect where men don t know how little they know about a topic  E g feminism and they think So they confidently mensplain feminism to women with no idea what they are talking about Hence so many comments under this post 
Feminism,1615641087,My roommate told me the same story O o  She was already really good and was earning money with it and he had no idea what he was talking about 
Feminism,1615640543,Thank you for posting this Sad that Russia has such patriarchal values  though no country is perfect in that regard either  
Feminism,1615640016, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action     
Feminism,1615638756,Agreed Don t have time for shite just cut them off  amp spend time with people you re aligned with It s not  hiding in a liberal safe space  life is just too short to stay friends with someone you don t respect out of a vague sense of loyalty
Feminism,1615638147,people with tendency to abuse are more often than not fucked beyond education though 
Feminism,1615636201, How am I questioning the lived reality of women  I refer you to your first point 
Feminism,1615636142,We change into trainers to walk home so we can run if necessary  Keys may not actually be combat effective but a lot of weapons that we might think would be useful are illegal in many countries 
Feminism,1615635478,So I ll go over your comment point by point Me talking about my degree is to communicate that I know the research that prove that man who belittle do so because they are ignorant nothing more No no one owes me an explanation unless all they do is being rude which is the only kind of reaction I got here How am I questionning the lived reality of women  I certainly am not I was arguing about what is and what isn t mansplaining because this expression was inappropriatly used here imo  No feminist here has been open for discussion as soon as they determined I was a man questionning the nature of the concept of mansplaining  I m almost certain you re gonna learn little from this well you missed my point entirely so yeah not much to learn 
Feminism,1615634592,How can you assess that  feminists are too quickly to call out mansplaining  By your degree Don t you think others on here have degrees as well or what If you do  how the hell does that matter in this context   Completely missed the mark there Feminists are pretty open for discussion and good faith questions Imo They still don t owe you an explanation though  People are upset because you came here not to learn something or to grow but to question and discredit the lived reality of women  Because you are part of the targeted group and it automatically sends you into defensive mode  You arguing about instances where a man legitimately corrects a woman  all while being presented with a very clear example is exactly that That s what happening here and people see right through it  hence the downvotes  Here s what people like you often fail to understand It s not about you  Women don t care about your degree or whether you re a good person We re talking about a  system of oppression in which there s a bias against certain people in this case women  I m almost certain you ll gonna learn little from this but at least you can t argue how much your  critique has been dismissed  even though you re not entitled to a discussion  And maybe some more curious and open minded man will find this and understands a bit more about feminism and its talking points Have a good one 
Feminism,1615682179,Try reading what OP posted ten times Might help Read it aloud maybe  I don t fucking know what to tell you   Maybe if more people with your opinion instead focused their ire and frustration on the men who are letting down the side and less on the people who hold men accountable you might get somewhere eventually  You kind of sound a bit like the type of person who says all lives matter 
Feminism,1615681730,Yes and we will probably never agree I m okay with that but you didn t answer my question 
Feminism,1615681500,I m going to get down voted and called some names I m sure  Why is it not socially acceptable to lump all of ANY other group together but it s perfectly fine to lump most all men together  If I m right most people who will defend this meme would speak out against memes that generalize women  even if it doesn t say ALL women  When a meme or a post says  men are    it s labeling men in general Just like when something says  women are    or  all young people are    
Feminism,1615679858,I used to think ftw was  Fuck the world so I feel you Worked surprisingly well in place of the real meaning
Feminism,1615677550,I think you may have missunderstood my point because I didn t really present it well  I agree Not just on the internet but overall when you start arguments when you are emotional it is unlikely that anyone will leave the argument with a changed view I didn t defend emotional responces I just think that topic like this will easly get poeple to act defensive as something about them is being criticized 
Feminism,1615675820,I am arguing in good faith I am not being the least bit aggressive If you don t want to argue with me that s your right but my points stand 
Feminism,1615675159,no one of the rules is goo faith you are vary much not making any points in good faith and are being aggressive so I am not going to argue with you 
Feminism,1615673552,Gee didn t see that comment coming No I didn t  mansplain anything And your comment does nothing to refute my argument  I didn t refute the idea behind  mansplaining being sexist toward women either I said the term is sexist Please read my comment again 
Feminism,1615671198,Same as when trump implied Mexicans were all rapist s or when racists accuse all minorities of being criminals   It s obvious they don t mean everyone of them are all those things  Why don t people get it Not  notallmen is so stupid it s obvious it s not all men 
Feminism,1615670502,    ain t so bad I d hint your position to your friend That your only friends of convenience wouldn t hang out with them if you had any other options  amp you don t respect their bigoted world view They ll either change  amp you ll stay friends a bit longer or you ll just go seperate ways next year It s tough if you don t have any other friends but it s not really worth staying in an unproductive relationship for fear of being alone I mean not saying you shouldn t fear being alone but you can t just be hanging out with someone you have no respect for to avoid being alone I d say just spend the year getting shit done then disappear in     
Feminism,1615670036,This is the vigil for Sarah Everard on Clapham Common London UK this evening  A serving police officer has been charged with her murder  He was also reported for indecent exposure the week before   yet he was still at work in uniform carrying a badge  The Reclaim These Streets vigil was organised for tonight which was cancelled today by police citing Covid Restrictions Women went anyway All across the country women are meeting in parks and shining lights into the sky 
Feminism,1615668327,One friend was saying things about another female friend about her being with a few guys and I called him out on it Thank you  It was kinda a great feeling  
Feminism,1615667882,That chart is great ILMAO I would add you re a fucking moron to probably definitely stop talking Reddit is a good example of this syndrome 
Feminism,1615667405,Honestly she would ve been gone a very long time ago but she s pretty much my only friend at current I m moving away to university in     so I m planning to cut her off then at the absolute least
Feminism,1615667331,That s what I try to tell myself but honestly I think she s just a bad person She s so racist that she refused to see me for weeks after going to a BLM protest because I was apparently around  dirty people that are more likely to have covid And same with that she s so solid with that belief she sees nothing wrong in it and doesn t even try to listen to alternative views
Feminism,1615667166,Honestly I ve had plans to cut her off for a while but she s currently pretty much my only friend If I had more people in my life then she d be long gone because she s just so incredibly entitled in her view of the world I m going to university in     so my plan is to  drift from her then as I ll be moving away
Feminism,1615666556,One man with the wrong intentions is enough men to be afraid Well put 
Feminism,1615666526,Once I argued with my mom about how woman should be prepared with enough self defense to everything evertime and she labeled me as a misogynist And I feel so foolish and wrong about my past self And I despise even the people who inherits same opinion as my past self but I despise even more the people are sexist and blaming victims  Just remind your sexist friend that there are people out there who is ready to go rape or murder but they just cant do in public because of laws and afraid of being caught more than doing it and this is not okay or normal either We are not in a jungle with wild animals anymore so why we should fear to go outside at night Even I can be anxious when I am the last alone passenger at night even though Im very tall I avoid to follow woman or passing her without even getting near to not to make her afraid because she can think Im stalking To just emphatise I think about what peoples worst act on every possible situation if I were woman because its what society expects to do for woman but its just terryfiening 
Feminism,1615666057,No its not all men But we don t know which men 
Feminism,1615665869,There are an abundance of scientific studies that have been carried out confirming that there is a difference between  men and women regarding what stimuli sexualy arouses them    Do you have evidence to back up what you re claiming   Can you like me some studies please 
Feminism,1615665753,But if it s a social problem we need to talk about it and that ll make all the  not all men men uncomfortable  D 
Feminism,1615663657,Toxic masculinity plays a role alot of comments on Facebook telling men to man up and protect women miss the point entirely Misogyny is so common I hear it all the time Its because something questions their pride or masculinity and makes them violent I think early education is key to make men less misogynist transphobic and homophobic 
Feminism,1615663315,Well if feminists would just stop saying things like  all men  or  men are trash  or  kill all men  maybe men wouldn t feel compelled to correct THOSE logical errors

Feminism,1615661615,when you mansplain why mansplaining is sexist against men in a feminism subreddit on a post about why mansplaining is sexist against women 
Feminism,1615660717,Wow that example O o  so overconfident and not knowing that China is in Asia damn   
Feminism,1615716957,I think you coming in to comment on a literal  not all men post about how you feel as poorly treated as a marginalized group of people  who again let me remind you were sprayed with high pressure fire hoses for asking for equal rights in some of their lifetimes because a woman called men around you not perfect on the  feminism subreddit speaks volumes to your perceived victimhood Like you realize the  enough men OP was talking about are rapists and murderers and you re in here like  awh they aren t so bad you shouldn t be that upset by it  Rape is shit and people who stick up for rapists are shit by extension even if it s passively and through whattaboutism 
Feminism,1615716627,I doubt anything you or your man bun profit could say would sink in any deeper than what I witnessed as a child I also doubt you or him have done as much real work helping actual victims of abuse  But don t let that stop you from responding with more condescending crap 
Feminism,1615715604,Since it is a feminist forum I am just reading and listening and learning 
Feminism,1615714825,Because it doesn t suit your narrative of victimhood not because it s innacurate 
Feminism,1615714516,Black people are currently oppressed by our government men usually do and have done the oppressing of women Literally not the same thing Deflection much 
Feminism,1615714290,I am guessing that it might sink in with you if you hear it from a man  Listen to what Chris Hemmings says about  Not All Men   The dude goes into schools and helps young boys to understand so it should help you too   Link  
Feminism,1615714130,I dunno mate   which parts don t you agree with That black people are marginalized based on their skin colour in a society that in their lifetime turned high pressure hoses on them for asking for equal rights That men are treated better by a society that has been set up to favor them for hundreds of years That comparing the two groups as being equally marginalized is as abhorrent and privelaged as it gets Every time a dude does this kind of shit a Ben Shapiro gets his wings 
Feminism,1615713751,No I just want you to tell me how those two statements aren t equally abhorrent  You know if you can take time away from your empty self righteous posturing 
Feminism,1615713365,Ohhhhh do you want a pat on the back Still doesn t make your comment less stupid
Feminism,1615712995, gt so why can t you just done this one small thing to make them feel more comfortable  Jesus how many other  small changes do you want us to add to the already large pile of  small changes women have had to make for the fragile male ego Whether  all men or not are sexual assailants I m confident to say yes all men when it comes to this ridiculous entitlement 
Feminism,1615712908,I did read it It was full of completely unfounded and totally inaccurate slander  And nothing more 
Feminism,1615712767,Lovely  More ad hominems  How many hours have you volunteered rehabbing homes for transitional housing for victims of domestic abuse 
Feminism,1615712633,It s a difficult one though The overwhelming majority of men aren t doing stuff like this and to see all these posts generalising the actions of a few as the actions of all is not okay You wouldn t say not all Muslims are terrorists but a few are so we have to be careful of all of them  that s just racist   
Feminism,1615712442,Sounds like you re the one with the hurt feelings  You know nothing about me  Not a single one of your assumptions or accusations is even remotely true which is to say they d all be incredibly offensive if I were inclined to respond with an emotional tirade on par with yours Still nothing you said explains how those two statements aren t equally abhorrent

Feminism,1615711701,Lmao who gave this douche an award for his smooth brain take 
Feminism,1615710723,Black people are given poorer medical care have fewer rights are killed because of their skin colour have a very recent history of being literal slaves and their votes are suppressed by white people Yesterday was the anniversary of Breonna Taylor s death a woman shot dead in her home by white police who faced no consequences Men get treated better Men have more privelage higher wages more expectations of equality more opportunities less  not non existent but less expectations of physical and sexual violence against them less blame or consequences for physical and sexual violence to name a few differences Look at the fact that you just threw out a victim card the second you weren t considered perfect and better based on your gender while a woman was trying to make a point Poor me I m not considered better than for five minutes I d better insert my opinion to prove I actually am better than while comparing myself to a marginalized group of people for the pain I felt at not being considered perfect and special during this exchange And before you go there I m a hispanic guy I m just done seeing  not all men try to detract from women s movements because it means men have to stop being special for five fucking minutes so yeah all men Men are trash I am trash because I have to be associated with people like you who can t see women asking for attention and help without pulling out the victim card and saying  b but my feelings are huwt on every post where a woman feels like a second class citizen because she s treated like one Next time your feelings are hurt instead of posting try stepping outside of yourself for five minutes to answer the question why someone might feel a certain way about something if you can t immediately see it Chances are it s because they re being treated in a way you can t and don t have to imagine because of the privelage of being not treated that way so trying to detract from that with weird dogwhistles or whattabouting isn t going to improve the situation for anyone and you re just making an ass of yourself and the rest of  all men  
Feminism,1615708539,If they were so mad maybe they should start getting mad at the rapists and misogynists instead of the women being raped and treated poorly for their choice in words and maybe that s the whole fucking problem  a former  not all men douchebag
Feminism,1615707391, gt No it s not all men But we don t know which men How is that any different from   No it s not all blacks But we don t know which blacks  
Feminism,1615706373,If you aren t part of that  all men group then speak out and talk about the issues and crimes committed against women daily Excluding yourself from the problem will not make the problem go away  
Feminism,1615704985,And it bothers me when someone says  not all men since they are immediately pushing the attention away from the real issue just because they feel uncomfortable by a statement People seriously need to stop jumping to conclusions and think for a sec 
Feminism,1615704931,You brought a really good point because I get the impression that at least here in the West some people accept more easily this prejudice against Muslim which is abhorrent  I say this as a guy that also had a prejudice against Muslims and took some time to change myself   Returning to the topic I find the thinking of this topic kind of disturbing and even hopeless if you think that almost half of the world population is male and you perceive half of the world as a threat to your life you are doomed   This thinking is not only bad to the male but to the female too especially those who had traumatic experiences 
Feminism,1615704304,In that moment give her quite a bit of space Cross to the other side of the road if you like make it clear with your body language and gait that you re just a person trying to get from point A to point B and have zero interest in her  But if you want to help women feel safe you can also try to make the world a safer place Copying an older comment of mine    gt You can educate yourself I d start with the book Sexual Citizens    gt    gt You can get involved in local politics and advocate for more effective legal frameworks to fight abuse and assault    gt    gt You can donate and volunteer for nonprofits that provide resources for battered women    gt    gt You can call out sexist beliefs and behaviors in your friends and family    gt    gt You can as an everyday practice  be aware of how you might be impacting women      gt    gt You can teach your children especially boys about how to be effective allies    gt    gt These are all starting points for ongoing efforts It isn t something you can do for a day or a week and then declare victory Learn give and lift as you are able    gt    gt  Here s a discussion   on another subreddit that I think you will find informative 
Feminism,1615703625,Yes when you advocate for that kind of thinking you indirectly make it acceptable in other situations too Now progressive people will say that it s not the same when it s applied to a minority or oppressed group and rightfully so But the thing is we don t all agree who s the victim and who s the oppressor Both TERF and the superstraight nuts think they are oppressed by trans people Fascist believe jews are the oppressors and immigrants are invaders and so on If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor Surely no fash believe all jews control the media or whatever 
Feminism,1615703029,Yeah its a bit of a sticky situation because I know the intentions of it but it still hurts I am a muslim and it is as if someone would replace the word men with Muslim and with the controversy of hijab and burka ban s going around in Europe it just does not make sense to me Its so discriminatory
Feminism,1615702971,The language is illustrative that the generalization is already happening Rape and harassment is just that common of an experience that we first prepare ourselves for the worst It s normal if it makes you uncomfortable If you are ever walking in a dark street and there s a single woman she WILL be aware and take precaution  cross the street have her keys ready so she can drive off etc   If you invite a woman over to your house for the first time she WILL tell her friends your name  amp address just in case Her father and brothers WILL be worried when she starts dating you It s nothing against you I m sure you re a nice person but until she gets to know you there s a real risk for her 
Feminism,1615702479,Let me try to you all think about this point by just changing the subjects   Most of the crimes here are committed by black people I was robbed several times not even one of them were white or Asian or another thing then black and I m even black too my direct ancestry were slaves and indigenous   So I could say I don t know which blacks are criminals or no if I m walking alone and see a black male I ll presume that he is a criminal and take care       No its not all blacks But we don t know which one       One black man with the wrong intentions is enough men to be afraid Well put         I don t agree with this and I don t find this thinking fair I prefer to presume that all blacks are innocent and decent men just like me until they prove contrary

Feminism,1615698260, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action     
Feminism,1615697691,If you want to compare this to the race situation the true analog to the criticism of men would be the criticism of white people not of black people At least there people are starting to realize that we re talking about white people as a monolith and not every individual white person so we don t have hashtags like  NotAllWhitePeople floating around 
Feminism,1615695174,Women  We are fearful of men and with good reason  You  Well that s just hurtful What about men   
Feminism,1615694434,No because the proportion of men versus women who are rapists is much higher      percent  And rape is way more common than murder Most of us know a rape victim 
Feminism,1615693890,This problem can so easily be solved just by using a qualifier Say  some  or  too many  Anything It s literally that simple You know by this point that a lot of men  notice the qualifier take issue with being overgeneralised as rapists and misogynists so why can t you just done this one small thing to make them feel more comfortable 
Feminism,1615691013,Ive said this before didnt know she said it too Thats cool great actor too
Feminism,1615689484,Don t spread bullshit that s not true If you re sexist just say it 
Feminism,1615689219,Men are not saying that she should have been careful from my point of view From what i ve seen it s men getting told that they are the problem which is generalising and doesnt help the situation
Feminism,1615688654,I do believe it s all men All male humans are socially conditioned  whether they realize it or not to be ignorant of women s minority position in society and their passive or aggressive complicity to th issue 
Feminism,1615687276,basically the same thing as saying that all black people are killers because      of americans are black and      of americans who got arrested for murder in     were black  which makes it statistically  x as likely to kill someone if you re black 
Feminism,1615686021,A downvote No explanation or comments You are up your own asshole 
Feminism,1615684891,Because other  groups of people are much closer together  groups  meanwhile the   sexes group that accounts for nearly     of the humans on earth also seems to have the biggest difference between groups Testosterone and Estrogen create much much more differences in people than Italian and Chinese blood could ever  So naturally people are gonna lump them together until the day they die Doesn t mean all of the criticisms found by lumping people together just because they are M or F is bad But stopping there without understanding the full context of a human being and simply saying  boys are bad because they re men will always be circular and invalid logic 
Feminism,1615682314,You are the problem Far too fragile and far too prone to digging your own grave 
Feminism,1615740158,As a straight white male ally Atleast in the southern states I can say men do not hold men accountable That s personal experience but I stand by that statement 
Feminism,1615739896, Calling out   blaming Yes all men should be called out to do better because we can and we should  If you re doing everything you can that s great   Keep it up  And make sure to hold those around you accountable as well If you re doing everything you can then you shouldn t feel personally attacked by this  It s literally as simple as that 
Feminism,1615739759,Yes This tweet and many of the replies are broad brushing men 
Feminism,1615739588,Yes Some of us do This tweet is using a broad brush and I don t think that is helpful to affecting change 
Feminism,1615737847,Just listen When you do hear or notice something speak up And if you don t then just listen 
Feminism,1615737801,Nobody is blaming men as a collective here  I am a man if you think this is post is calling you out it s because you re part of the problem 
Feminism,1615736738,I m gonna go ahead and say the intervention part isn t true I had a friend who casually told me a story about how he basically sexually harassed a girl and when he was called out on it his only response was the get mad and defensive I m gonna go out on a limb and say most of the guys with these tendencies towards women will not react well when called out even by men This isn t to say it isn t men s jobs to call out toxic behavior just wondering how we can realistically correct it if the people perpetrating it don t want to hear it 
Feminism,1615736102, When  in   men are shit and the other  do nothing they might as well not fucking be there  is a quote I think about a lot

Feminism,1615735147,Pretty sure women are more likely to be assaulted by a friend or family member than by a stranger 
Feminism,1615734147,It basically tribalism     people stick  up for those they feel empathy for whether they be men or women or animals I do agree though that women needn t be trusting of men who are strangers It s  simply not worth the risk So if this makes them unfriendly then so be it They needn t bother 
Feminism,1615733456, gt then why aren t all men helping women in ways that would lessen the violence women face That s my point The OP and many others like you demand that literally every single man act in a certain way That s absurd There are many ways to effect change and support without following your demands  gt Misandry does not even exist Yikes  gt I just know you re racist in the way you refer to black people as  blacks as well as stereotyping Muslims as terrorists Honestly I can see why you would say this because it does feel a little rough coming off the tongue But the verbiage has been very fluid over the recent years and there really isn t an accepted term yet People of color colored people black people blacks African American etc all offend someone for some reason Know that I acknowledge that but saying I m a racist because of that is a way to try and dehumanize me so you don t have to address my argument or simply ignore it as invalid The Muslim thing was also part of the point I m making Reading comprehension will tell you that I don t believe Muslims are terrorists The statement is terrible and very bigoted However I simply crafted it using the exact language of the original post to make a point This tweet OP basically says  all men are the problem in some way  How would that read about blacks whites Muslims women etc  etc 
Feminism,1615733421,It s  very counter productive to blame men as a collective Most intelligent decent people will not tolerate harassment 
Feminism,1615733207,Probably not  all       but  many  Feels like a some kind of competition or a revenge on men honestly To make such broad and stupid assumptions Maybe women should hang out with more men Feels absurd to read these threads as a man who doesn t witness that much harassment in social circles nightclubs or such environments And if it happens it has instant consequences 
Feminism,1615733177,I know for a fact women do not have talks with daughters about men s safety

Feminism,1615732465,There are absolutely men that stand up and advocate for women s rights and safety It is unfortunate that you haven t met any and that makes it obvious that there aren t enough men doing that But they do exist

Feminism,1615730693,Too little too late I woke up a few days ago to check my social media to be attacked by    of people that I use to call friends People posting stuff saying  all men are responsible all men are complicit  Because of  what some sick psyco did to some poor woman in London It is not my responsibility for what some random stranger does Period I know who I am and I choose to spend my time with good honest people I don t need to influce the  bad men because I don t spend my time with those kind of people It is not my responsibility what strangers do I was lucky to be brought up by an amazing single mum that taught me right from wrong She is a saint  It is not her responsibility for what a stranger does I was a feminist until a few days ago Feminism has lost a good ally And I can t be the only one  I want to thank a lot of friends that targeted those kind of men in their posts And didn t attack and blame good people    Feminism and any other political activists don t do enough work to stamp out their respective extremists It s those extremists that make people lose faith in that cause The exact people that you actually need on your side The irony  I no longer consider myself a feminist I will continue to do the right thing and campaign for change but I will not do it under the label anymore  Seriously fuck you  Don t waste your time commenting on my post because my notifications are turned of
Feminism,1615730691,I ve seen it in my group of acquaintances  I m very deliberately not calling them  friends   Some of them are fairly decent when talking one on one and almosr none are ever outright shitty when talking in front of the girls but when it s only the boys around it s open season for all the misoginy body shaming and anti feminism imaginable  And the less shitty more reasonable among them are dragged along as well because you want to fit in On the other hand any criticism is met with open resistance from the ringleaders I ve distanced myself from them I ve come to the conclusion stopping them or reasoning with them is out of my reach and only further fuels their narrative I try to keep touch with the ones I consider my friends still to keep them grounded away from that extremism I m not saying this is always the case but it s heartbreaking seeing previously reasonable people radicalizing and being powerless to do anything

Feminism,1615726495,Hmmm   Replace the term  Men with other religion ethnicity race etc etc And it comes off as being discriminatory as fuck 
Feminism,1615726293,I think a big part of the problem is that the men who treat women like shit often group together and validate their behaviour within those groups I can t honestly say there are any guys I know who are or have been shitty to women  to my knowledge  And that s another part of the problem I don t know how my friends treat women when I m not around It s hard to call someone out on something if I have no idea what s going Best I can do is lead by example whenever there s an opportunity to do more than be passive and hope it s well received 
Feminism,1615725872,As a man with narcissistic tendencies myself who hopefully didn t cause any trauma or anguish but certainly was unstable in past relationships it s very common for me to want to publicly display somehow that I m  reformed and think people will see that and fully change their mind about me I personally have stopped myself every time and realized the moment I do that will be a complete disgrace to the movement and everything I ve learned from it  I have absolutely  sympathy for myself and others like this I just imagine this sort of thing is really common Just another opportunity for men to take over what belongs to women and expect credit and praise while not having to deal with the stakes of it 
Feminism,1615725746,If everyone actually did what they could this would no longer be a problem Maybe you do but maybe someone else dont
Feminism,1615725672,Another redirect See This is the actual problem She raises a question and you go WHAT ABOUT THE WOMEN Taking away yet again focus It s just another way to say  not all men 
Feminism,1615725561,That s the thing the day the men says enough to the abusers it will stop right away If your friend acts badly towards a woman at work and you tell him they buddy I don t accept that kind of behaviour He will literally never do it again the shame to lose face in front of another man But as long as the abusers friends look the other way or even laugh it s consent enough to even make him escalate his behaviour It s obviously not enough with women saying stop 
Feminism,1615725475,I agree still you have to consider that all this information is not reaching the people it is supposed to reach Some random teen encounters part of it gets into a twitter argument with a few trolls and then starts to think that feminism is about hating all men A possible ally is turned into a misinformed bystander and people on the fence are driven towards misogyny 
Feminism,1615725118,Hmm we do what we can to make it safe for the people  we care Unfortunately we can t stand up for everyone 
Feminism,1615724929,Oh have you decided to pretend you were joking because your insistence that your volunteer work makes you more knowledgeable about abuses committed against women than women themselves wasn t working Get the heck out of r Feminism You clearly are not a feminist 
Feminism,1615724699,Valid point but do all women do that too I can promise to you that I m more worried about the effect my mother will have on my niece than my brother
Feminism,1615723881,Sadly I think the answer is no not all men do stand up for women It s one thing to say you believe in equality and fair treatment and another thing entirely to call out your closest friends and family on harmful behaviour Personally I don t know of any other guys in my life who have actively stood up for women myself included if I m being honest

Feminism,1615721827, the actual victims of abuse I ve worked with have acquired a pretty keen sense of  which men   If true then what you re saying is   women need to just sense which men are bad but also that women who do have this sense are not saved from abuse anyway With that solution being flawed shouldn t you agree that abusive men are the problem not women wary of abusive men 
Feminism,1615721422,Honestly you wouldn t be able to pass any screening I know of to be anywhere near victims of abuse  I m pretty sure the only one pretending here is you  Take your fake outrage and tie it inro a cute bun then fuck yourself with it

Feminism,1615720427, gt Judging by the number of repeat clients it would seem  which is their type  This is pretty well researched in the field of psychology It s an aspect of trauma bonding a person within a traumatic relationship   abusive harassing sexual violence anything like that   will sometimes become dependent on the person abusing them Which can happen for however many reasons often gaslighting or simply not having a way out   it s safer to become dependent than to completely isolate yourself and to put yourself into a potentially more dangerous situation by leaving You can just google trauma bond if you want it explained in better terms Once the victim of this leaves the relationship however they ll often get into relationships with other abusive people Not because that s their  type   which is just a sickening thing to say honestly nobody goes out of their way to find abusive partners   but because the traits extant on their previous abusive partner that they  fell in love with will also be extant on new potential partners The trauma bond doesn t magically go away when you leave a relationship and if you became bonded to a person who was emotionally negligent and ignored your interests then its easy to become attached to another person who is also emotionally negligent because that s simply what love looks like in your traumatised experience It s also that abuse can decimate your self esteem So you leave one abusive relationship but can often feel like you deserved the abuse or at least don t deserve true love so you re willing to put up with other abusive relationships because at least then you re not alone with your own poor mental state

Feminism,1615754284,This feels uncomfortably similar to  this     To be clear I m very pro refugee and I disagree with the skittles analogy which is why the similarity is uncomfortable 
Feminism,1615753891,It is just so wild to me that my mom  amp dad spent my whole life insinuating or flat out saying men only want one thing don t go walking at night get nervous about me living alone and then scoff when I m like I m wary of ALL men and don t understand why I m so particular about dating Like what did you think was gonna happen 
Feminism,1615753850,Curious about your hashtag of   to many woman  Is it short for  annoying to many woman or  a pest to many woman  or perhaps  unsurprising reflexive misogyny directed to many woman  Actually that was a rubbish guess This game is fun 
Feminism,1615753759,Same argument with  not all cops are bad  I think of that particularly after seeing the news about the Met police roughing up the crowd that was there for Sarah Everard s vigil the other night 
Feminism,1615753746,I like the idea behind the analogy but I feel it falls flat because the only real relationship we have with ticks is that they carry Lyme disease while men women relationships are very very complex and it can be alienating to suggest men don t care and or aren t doing anything about women s issues  I think what you mean to say is something like  not enough men  meaning not enough men are calling out abusers rapists etc because it doesn t affect them as much as it affects women This is a message I think  practically all men can get behind The disconnect comes from the fact that men as a whole need to do more but men as individuals feel absolutely powerless to change anything and it s demoralizing to treat men like they don t care on the whole 
Feminism,1615753146,The Bro Code by Barney Stinson a very interesting and useful book
Feminism,1615752923,Since you only care about single statistic     U S Census Bureau which revealed that in      a study of a percentage women and men who admitted to forcing sex found that     per cent of that subset were women compared to     per cent of men     college study of    men and boys which found that   had been sexually coerced into unwanted intercourse with   per cent of the perpetrators reported as being female    toManyWoman
Feminism,1615752184,No because its not my responsibility nor obligation to deal with the malicious behavior of those who  happen to be the same sex as I Are all women  required to stop other women s bad behavior I certainly don t expect them to because they re not affiliated with every other woman on the planet The same goes for men 
Feminism,1615752112,It s rather telling when a man feels personally attacked by other men being held to account Source am a man 
Feminism,1615748137, all it takes for evil to succeed is for good  people to do nothing 
Feminism,1615748089,As a man no far too many men don t But I do and I ll be teaching any children I have to do the same 
Feminism,1615747797,This this this Generally I fear men far more than I feel protected by them without a doubt They ve collectively traumatized us    
Feminism,1615746719,I don t personally think this is a man vs woman thing For instance I doubt many women have step up for a man when they see their wife belittling them in public Or that many daughters have discussions with their parents about the importance of men s emotional mental well being But that doesn t make all women coabusers  What s going on is called the bystander effect When you are taught cpr you are told that you can t just say  call     to a crowd No one will act You need to say  hey you in the white shirt call      The key is to transform it into a personal responsibility issue Otherwise people of both genders will just stand idly by and watch  So in general we need to create a better society with more empathy and personal responsibility We need to create people who will stand up and act against injustice when they see it whether it be related to sexism racism income inequality etc And we need both men and women doing that if we want things to change It s so so hard as people are wired to be risk adverse and not sacrifice themselves for others So rather than blast people for not standing up we should frame it in a way where we praise the people who do People like to be praised and get defensive in the face of criticism So I think with these types of issues you go with the carrot rather than the stick
Feminism,1615746338,I understand that sexism against women tends to happen more often than against men however if you are really looking for true equality surely you should still be asking the same question about women when there is sexism against men Both are a problem  Would just like to add though that I do still believe every point here is valid however it is unnecessarily targeted at one gender and I hope I don t have to point out that that is the sexism you claim to be against
Feminism,1615745894,Jameela probably doesn t go far enough I have a friend group which is a healthy balance of males and females and can assure you all the men in my group actively protect women However  a stag do when I was allowed witness to another groups attitudes left me wondering about wider society Rape jokes cat calling and women exclusively as object were commonplace and it left me wondering about wider society Did I call it out I did not 
Feminism,1615745432,It s true that  notallwomen harm men But do all women make sure their fellow women do not harm men Do they interrupt troubling language and behavior in others Do they have conversations about men s safety consent with their daughters Are  allwomen interested in our safety  See where this is going

Feminism,1615741238,this is something I talk about a lot I m a white cis hetero  presenting I m bi but in a committed relationship with a cis woman man the kind of shit that other men will say to me expecting me to be  in on the joke is deeply disconcerting in the before time I worked in behind bars so there was often ample opportunity to experience casual misogyny of men who thought they were  safe to speak their mind total head scratcher that people think how they behave around women is the only meter they will be judged by I like to think I ve confronted men about this in as productive ways as possible but it s really something you have to put effort into and I can t imagine it s incredibly common I have a massive amount of privilege and it s often deeply uncomfortable all the same

Feminism,1615740212,This list doesn t do feminism justice as there s barely any mentions of all the great  side effects of feminism any LGBTQ issues racism or intersectional issues in general  which admittedly the lack of used to be a huge problem within feminism and still is in large parts  It also doesn t bring up anything about how feminism has progressed the discussion about gender in academia something which I suspect is very undervalued In other words it focuses on specifically men s issues that are not related to sexuality race etc The intention is not to say feminism is equally about men as it is for women it does certainly focus on women and is completely fine doing so but the point is that the larger majority of the movement do care and that there is an expanding space within feminism that can and do talk about it Solving men s issues help women and vice versa  though my personal opinion is that it s most effective to do both  The goal is to give feminists an easy

Feminism,1615776292,This is something I have been trying to do   Honestly I catch myself mostly   It just reminds me that it takes continual effort to change 
Feminism,1615776061,Yup I get really pissed when I see an insta post that s like  girls guys   insert stereotype  like holy shit what s so hard about putting  some before it What s so hard about not generalizing
Feminism,1615775871,Yes and I feel as if over generalizing of people  amp groups is the cause of a lot of mis understood issues nowadays 
Feminism,1615775771,Exactly Said it on another post but gonna say it again because these posts keep popping up Not all men is used as a derailing tactic They know what they re doing The more you spell it out for them in posts like these the better their strategy is working We are teaching and wasting energy engaging with dumb arguments rather than actually discussing more pertinent issues Stop humouring them and let s get back to having actual fruitful discourse in the FEMINISM subreddit 
Feminism,1615775719, gt And who are responsible for constantly perpetuating those stereotypes Everyone is responsible not just men Come on this is basic feminist theory that you re getting wrong
Feminism,1615775440,That is a good point I think the problem with the post is it is singling out physical harm instead of just power in general Expanding it to power makes a better point but the tick analogy doesn t cover it very well then It s also is a bit too much of a blanket statement  But it s enough to keep us in a constant state of fear  This is saying that all women are always in fear because of the potential of physical harm from men  I guess the question is who is the target audience If it s meant to show people who don t understand what you explained it doesn t do a very good job You however summed up what it should have said very succinctly I think it s very easy to say men have many different types of power over women and almost all men have abused that power even if only minimally It s much more relatable and less polarizing Anyway I m new here and if I ve come off as ignorant please let me know I m here to try and be less ignorant 
Feminism,1615774979,I don t like generalization I see through the intentions of those people who rush to say  not all men to downplay women s problems But when a person says something bad and adds  all men to it then I really think that s wrong Isn t the point to just get rid of generalization entirely 
Feminism,1615774929,I think when people say  not all men they re trying to call out the fact that some people think  all men are fucking idiots and  all men can go die in a hole  Nobodies saying women should just stop worrying when they go outside in the dark and worry about being sexually assaulted 
Feminism,1615773659,Thank you for spreading awareness you honestly never know who you can reach with this message and how they can become inspired to make a change Here s to collective responsibility for improving women s safety  lt  
Feminism,1615772401,I mean    this isn t an original post they still have guardians in some countries 
Feminism,1615771680,I wish some of them had juuust this much self control
Feminism,1615770462,I just wanted to come here and say that men are not monsters we are humans U guys have created this narrative that men do all the wrong and women are absolutely blameless for their actions While  women dies at the hands of a bad person does not mean all men are responsible for his actions Young men die everyday and as a young man u have a higher chance of dying in the street then women We are not monster stop trying to demonize masculinity Its  women who died why don t we bring up all the wives that kill their husband s and get away wit it 
Feminism,1615770178,It s true that  notallwomen falsely accused men But do all women work to make sure their fellow women do not falsely accuse men Do they interrupt troubling language and behaviour in others Do they have conversations about mens safety consent with their daughters Are  allwomen interested in our safety 
Feminism,1615769706,The difference is about power dynamics and what the agenda is  When it comes to violence against females the group with less power is developing safety strategy based on frequent experiences so they don t continue to be harassed by those in power  The agenda is equality  In the case of refugees the group with more power is bullying the group with less power using isolated incidences as examples The agenda is political power  perhaps sprinkled with white supremacy  Essentially those in power should not abuse their power As a corollary it s vitally important we all recognize where we as individuals are in power and where we aren t A same person can be in different categories for different issues  eg a male refugee is in power as a male and not in power as a refugee We should help him out as a refugee but call him out if he mistreats his wife  
Feminism,1615768995,All people have a duty to work for the betterment and safety of others 
Feminism,1615768959,I think it would make a difference if we started to really acknowledge the mental health and substance abuse issues that contribute heavily to violence against women 
Feminism,1615768817,I mean I m sure there are men I would consider or at some point have considered friends who do those things but they don t do any of that around me I mean I m not really a man but most people only know me as one so maybe it s different for others but I think a lot of times men who do say and do this shit know who among their friends they can get away with being open about that with 
Feminism,1615768758,Kinda late out here but look up the Polgar sisters They re kind of like real versions of Beth Harmon women who made it to the highest echelons of competitive chess 
Feminism,1615767957,Cap I m not a baby sitter not responsible for the shitty behavior of others  Or can an individual woman really not take care of themself    I swear none of you are actual feminists
Feminism,1615767435,Yeah not all men are abusers but enough are that its a problem
Feminism,1615766185, gt He will literally never do it again That s incorrect Is this anecdotal or just something you assume would happen if a guy was called out because that has NOT been my partners  m experience    When he s called guys out for bad behaviour he s been met with denial anger brushed off and laughed at ignored and very commonly gets ganged up on by other guys in the group who also feel attacked because they do say the same shit Any other time he gets along with these same guys really well just not when he s calling them out   My partner sells cars and deals with a lot of sexism and monogyny among the salesmen and mechanics An example of behaviour    Woman comes in to deal with the company for whatever reason mechanics get all excited and start elbowing each other encouraging each guy to try get a look even if it s to go into an area they normally aren t in talk about what they d do to her partner hears it and tells them their behaviour is gross and desperate they laugh and tell him to basically F off he s just emotional white knight SJW etc    Second example Partner was out of town for training along with another dude when they go out for dinner before returning their hotel Not long after partner learns this dude has a GF he sees him on Tinder trying to hook up with multiple girls for the ONE night they re staying there Partner calls him out gently saying  that s messed up     it s been a year and half now and this dude hates his guts still and tries to mess with him   Last example His friends he grew up with used the word  gay to express annoyance disgust boredom etc He decides to call his friend out on it one day friend thinks it s a joke and not serious keeps doing it multiple times until he realised partner is serious sort of stopped doing it for a while before going back to it because he  has gay friends who said it s ok so it s ok  Didn t have much to say when my partner responded back that both him and I are bi and my brother is trans and we re actually not ok with it It s toned down now but it hasn t  literally ever happened again like you want to believe    I m not attacking you or your ideal situation because how freaking great would it be if men DID just need one talking to by their mates before they changed their behaviour Sadly that s not realistic though It takes people a while to accept they might be wrong about their long term behaviour and longer to rewire the brain  especially the older the person is  I mean would you instantly change when    people never had an issue with your behaviour over   years but now one random friend is saying you re not actually the nice upstanding person everyone else said you were 
Feminism,1615765312,That s just blatantly wrong Nobody should be assaulted in anyway and yes women are victims dramatically more often but this type of comment does nothing to change anything    
Feminism,1615764330,I read it it s indeed a cohesive study But the solution in the conclusion doesn t put the blame on the idea of  false perception of female innocence but the fact that gender stereotypes put many of those men in positions where they are unable to identify their own abuse And who are responsible for constantly perpetuating those stereotypes     Gasp   Men did you shot yourselves in the foot and now you want to blame a statistic on women even when your own article concludes the problem is a male made issue unless you want to argue that somehow women were able to perpetuate those stereotypes 
Feminism,1615764053,Uhhh   because we don t care for being harassed assaulted raped murdered etc I know women am I right   
Feminism,1615763947,Plus  speak to your sons Make them a better ally and they ll be stronger men and happier people It s not a zero sum game 
Feminism,1615763844,My book What English grammar   I think you re trying to troll feminism but realising that grammar pedants are a far greater threat  Feminism is cool tho 
Feminism,1615762194,I have a question so why do I always here women being scared of men when it s dark in the streets
Feminism,1615760803,standing up for women didn t stop me getting raped by one I don t understand these rhetorical statements of course not all men are interested in this as not all women are interested in treating other women or men as equal shitty people exist everywhere and it doesn t matter what gender they are 
Feminism,1615760616,says the person who cannot find any counter argument to change my mind of course I have other thing to do than speak with ppl that disagree with me but cannot find anything to change my mind good luck finding gender equality with such methods cause if you can t explain me how I m wrong when I m all ears of course I won t agree with you
Feminism,1615760040,Yes it is absolutely your responsibility to call out sexist comments and jokes towards women not doing anything about it leads to desentisization of sexual assault and rape therefore less likely to take sexual assault and rape seriously which is why women talk about their greviances men don t believe them In the UK    of young women      years old have sexual harassment it s not women s job to fix this it s a problem with men and it is our responsibility to flattern that percentage not taking reponsibility as you said makes you part of the problem
Feminism,1615759940,You re only showing your ignorance Since you re so insulted I m sure you will find something else to do 
Feminism,1615759843,says the person who is straight up insulting me  and no it was not useless I m showing my disagreement based on facts hoping people would be a little bit open minded but I guess insulting strangers is waaaaayyyy more useful
Feminism,1615759691,This is a really good start u LapisRS I wish more men would simply   ask  the way you re doing    You might also listen to the women around you when they complain about things men say or do Or ask those women about it giving them a safe space and making no comments when they answer you There are obvious things that men say and do that range from inappropriate to harmful but there are also things that may seem innocent but make a solid percentage of women feel uncomfortable or unsafe For example a while back I complained to an otherwise pretty forward thinking male friend about how hard it was to find a boyfriend to which he replied that maybe if I smiled more and let strangers approach me I d have a boyfriend Stuff like that 
Feminism,1615759428,And as a woman I can believe that because most men that I ve encountered have been very respectful to me 
Feminism,1615758532,  If you read and understood the comments you would know not to say something so monumentally useless 
Feminism,1615758500,Ok but men don t owe you protection Thats it thats why Do you jump to protect men No you don t 
Feminism,1615758351,ok so you re making the assumption that all men do these things and that s not true  I am an exemple at least no I read only the comments not the responses so I had a global idea of what feminists wanted to say and how they are thinking
Feminism,1615757346,or maybe you didn t find the right partner we all got our ways and there is probably one person there that like the same thing as you
Feminism,1615757343,Probably an unpopular opinion that will kill my karma but I m not sure that all men having a duty to be the protectors of women is feminism This reads more like   th century coverture 
Feminism,1615757265,the username is a pure joke don t use it as an argument and don t think you re smart cause you pointed it out  i m not saying you are

Feminism,1615781201,I wonder if we re due for this kind of discussion to remind us all why stereotypes are immoral and undesirable We all grew up being told not to stereotype whole groups based on individuals that prejudice is bad but a lot of us probably haven t spent much time weighing the pros and cons because it is just seen as an obviously awful thing to do full stop Then enough time goes by that someone can openly advocate the textbook definition of prejudice and there are some people who go  yeah you know what stereotypes are actually pretty useful I wonder why we ever stopped using them People are like ticks if enough are bad then it s ok to act as though they re all that way makes perfect sense

Feminism,1615780465, gt This is true though Whenever I am walking in the dark I  am always in a constant state of fear Even it s not dark and I need to walk past a group of men who are loitering there is a baseline fear always  My smart watch will show a sudden increase in heart rate  Ya I see what you mean there It s an odd dichotomy that men can both make women feel safe and also fear just by being present I was picturing walking with my wife This would make her feel more safe However I m sure she would still have some fear walking past a group of men even if I were with her Depending on the situation of course Plenty of food for thought there Idk I guess it was hard for me to identify with the core of what the post meant And then I see comments like some in this thread basically saying that if someone doesn t get it now they never will Well I didn t get it and you helped me understand I know there are people who fight against this and  not all men is a tactic I feel like at a glance it s a damn good tactic for someone who doesn t want to understand Someone who doesn t want to examine themselves gets a free pass because they aren t violent Now if they re not guilty why get introspective Anyway what I m trying to say is thanks for not being dismissive and taking the time to articulate the subject 
Feminism,1615780403,This argument would also work really well to support a lot of really heinous forms of bigotry like anti semitism as acceptable because  in the eyes of the anti Semite the Jews are the party in power and have the control Or poor white people and affirmative action or men going through family court Just because a group thinks they have less power than another group in a particular instance does not make stereotypes and sexism morally acceptable 
Feminism,1615780175,I just don t think so I owe no duty to you unless we enter into privity Also the post was sex specific It assumes either that women need men s protection or that men have a duty to women or both As a woman I don t need a man to take care of me As a feminist I believe in individualism and empowerment via personal responsibility 
Feminism,1615779407,If I did the same thing with the male reproductive organs this whole subreddit would go ape shit
Feminism,1615779365, when  in   women are only out for the money and the other  do nothing they all are out for the money  Wrong quote  Changed men women Changed shit money How is that quote even a aurgment I used the same aurgment with different nouns and verbs It could apply to so many different things and more clear as to why it as a aurgment basis Doesn t make sense So all drinkers are responsible for all drunk driving deaths  No it s only drinkers are responsible for drunk driving  The whole party isn t responsible for the lesser  of fucked up individuals 
Feminism,1615778730,Good idea for a comic and I agree in principle but this is cringe tbh As feminists we really need more affective talking points than complaining abt teenage boys who say  not all men  It s a fine talking point in spaces primarily for women but it s bringing no men over to our side unfortunately Talking about the  in  women and  in  men and other rape statistics I think is a much better way to converse about rape culture We  need better consent education regardless of assigned gender 
Feminism,1615777906,Oh absolutely I used men in my example because I see them get defensive more but you re right in that it occurs from both sexes quite frequently
Feminism,1615777830,Yeah i guess I was also talking about girls too I don t like it when anyone stereotypes generalizes either gender
Feminism,1615777690,Couldn t agree more Most of these arguments can be avoided by just saying   some men do  x  instead of  men do  x   Imagine actually being able to discuss a problematic behavior with someone because they don t feel personally attacked or accused    That being said the  some is often implied and simply not picked up on 
Feminism,1615777524,Yep this Exactly this See also  a few bad apples instead of understanding the huge underlying systemic issue and way too much injustice 
Feminism,1615777200,It s also similar to racist talking points  Replace the  men with any other group and it s really obvious 
Feminism,1615776949,All analogies are just proxies of the actual issues and they often remove the context My point was that comparing  different analogies doesn t always make sense because the context can be very different  ie power dynamics  I agree that for the same issue you may need different analogies to get the point across to different people In this graphic I am interpreting tick bites as an analogy for  all types of harm  physical  amp mental as verbal abuse is still abuse   gt This is saying that all women are always in fear because of the potential of physical harm from men This is true though Whenever I am walking in the dark I  am always in a constant state of fear Even it s not dark and I need to walk past a group of men who are loitering there is a baseline fear always  My smart watch will show a sudden increase in heart rate  
Feminism,1615797935,I think this thread sums it up Stereotypes and prejudice apology is the right wing approach The left wing one is that it s not men as individuals who are the target of criticism but social structures 
Feminism,1615797646,Some issues are very much gendered though and sexual violence is definitely one of them So yes everyone needs better education but this could be interpreted in a genderblind kind of way which would be a mistake  not that I think that s what you meant by this 
Feminism,1615797641,Someone called this sexist and the comment as well  Takes all sorts  
Feminism,1615796812,as I explained in a similar  thread    gt Now  progressive people will say that it s not the same when it s applied to  a minority or oppressed group and rightfully so But the thing is we  don t all agree who s the victim and who s the oppressor Both TERF and  the superstraight nuts think they are oppressed by trans people Fascist  believe jews are the oppressors and immigrants are invaders and so on  If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not  just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor Surely no fash  believe all jews control the media or whatever 
Feminism,1615795220,Aside from a few factual corrections  as far as I m aware men are punished more severely for all types of crime and are more at risk for violent crime although I could be wrong  I m curious as to why the distinction of privilege is significant in this case I acknowledge readily that racial minorities have been and are oppressed by white people as a class I acknowledge that women are oppressed by men as a class in some respects although unlike with race this relationship is much more fuzzy Nonetheless if I am determining whether or not to cross the street when I see someone of a certain racial or gendered characteristic coming why does it matter if the class the trait belongs to is the oppressive or oppressed group 
Feminism,1615794977,So would it be justified for me to distrust all poor looking people or racial minorities because similar statistics exist for their perpetration of crime or not Is it acceptable to judge individual people based on data about their social class if the price of trust is your own safety  I m asking this in good faith this isn t a  gotcha moment or anything 
Feminism,1615794745,I completely agree with this pic but man it s gonna be weird being a cop and still holding these opinions 
Feminism,1615794226,Ticks don t have feelings though Being innocent with to ill intention but being treated as such is unfair It s like saying all humans are murderers because some are 
Feminism,1615794063,Not the same thing  Cops are supposed to stop such things  If I see someone catcalling or discriminating a woman most of the time the best I can do I is voice my opinion Cops have the authority to stop other cops from doing illegal things 
Feminism,1615793897,No With  all men it s  too many men  With  all cops it s quite literally every single last cop because that s what the job is 
Feminism,1615792517,Except it is all cops The ones who do their job properly and follow the rules are still doing something immoral They re using violence to uphold an unjust social order on the behalf of the rich and powerful Even the nicest neighborhood beat cop is doing that
Feminism,1615792188,As a man I ve been bullied by other men for defending women in certain situations I honestly don t even wanna bring up some of the situation because they re extremely triggering  both for me and also women here but all I can say is be mindful of the way men treat women be mindful of how women feel in the moment and be mindful of the dangerous realities that women face every day 
Feminism,1615792106,I m so glad those pieces of shit conservatives got kicked out in WA Biggest loss in history apparently Now we need to get them out of the government and make them obsolete Can t believe people have been supporting rape enablers for this long When will people learn conservatives do not care 
Feminism,1615792105,People have different life experiences Remember that before you judge somebody
Feminism,1615792072,Listen to her point of view Understand where she s coming from I m a conservative and my best friend is really liberal and we are like brothers 
Feminism,1615791806,Comparing men to ticks is not a good way to win over people  The best way to refute  not all men is to point out that feminists aren t saying  all men are bad in the first place it s the men who are trying to discredit them by unfairly generalizing and trying to turn this into a purity test  bad men vs innocent good men  Feminists say that some men are actively bad many more are disengaged and unhelpful often going along with the bad guys and that more broadly there are broader forces like masculinity and gender roles which can t be discussed in terms of individual guilt and innocence 
Feminism,1615791507,   Damn you both have some great perspective here I couldn t agree more with everything you guys have said and I support women who think this but just because I saw this brought up somewhere else I thought I d help clear it up here    I should preface that I hate the argument that I m about to talk about its based on racist ignorance and doesnt take into effect the context of America s negative history    People  not just women have been trying to find a parallel to this point by arguing that they should similarly be more afraid of black men because they are more likely to commit crime in their area The difference between the arguments is the context that Black people have disproportionately been forced in poorer neighborhoods and been oppressed in the workforce Essentially the crime comes from living in poverty not being black  e g  a third variable  The context as you said seems to play a particularly large role in understanding these types of social points and the variables that cause the social distress Do you have any thoughts on this I would love to hear anyone s perspective on how this point is isn t relatable to the point about men because I ve been arguing with racist family on Facebook about this these last few days I sure could use more help because their sexism and racism is extremely stubborn and frustrating     A follow up point the argument used against men  may be most applicable for anyone scared to walk down the street in an impoverished area at night As a Brazilian American I always avoid going to certain areas of my city in Brazil because they have more crime These areas just happen to be the poorest areas I by no means hate poor people though similarly to how the argument against men doesn t mean that women hate all men There s just strong information that informs our actions to be careful in these social situations    Even though the point above and the point about women fearing men seems fundamentally the same there is a huge difference again it s context The situation with poverty can be changed much faster than the situation with men this is because of how the situation with poverty has been constructed differently If the government just heavily funds these poorer communities we can simply eradicate these criminal differences without the need for more policing which leads to more unnecessary death I don t give a shit if people think my idea is socialist BS  most Brazilian family hate me for thinking this way  they can suck my socialist butt The situation with men cannot be fixed that easily I hope that all made sense I m tired af writing two   page neuroscience research papers studying for exams and barely getting by financially Life honestly makes me so depressed and exhausted but you all make me feel more confident that we re moving in the right direction 
Feminism,1615790956,Excuse mine and his spelling errors  in the post of mean Off not of And On the first photo I meant And not as 
Feminism,1615790789,listen and always be ready to attack when needed fellow white knight
Feminism,1615790637,Okay so the way I look at it is that rather than criticizing men focus criticism on male socialization behaviour So directing anger towards the systemic patriarchal structures that foster toxic male behaviour rather than the general male population That being said I want to clarify that when women make the decision to avoid be guarded around men it is not the same as prejudice Prejudice is hatred or discrimination based on affiliation with a  harmless group while being wary of men is based on the very real threat that they pose to women 
Feminism,1615790528,when people say  all cops and  all men they mean  too many cops and  too many men and some people will really never understand

Feminism,1615790287,I don t think it s a privelege to enter the Millitary on lower standards It s not an office job and it s not bloodless There is a perfectly fine debate to be had about how to integrate women into the Millitary and prepare them to become killing machines  geopolitical agents of dominance However much of the online buzz about this issue seems to be ego driven and is more about affirming men s traditional role as guard dogs than the actual efficacy of female soldiers in question There s been a recent move to make the US ACFT more gender neutral in its standards  here   is an article about that The only rational POV here  within a hawk context is to recruit the soldiers who are best able overall to cope with service duties and then funnel them into specific roles based on their abilities Beyond this there d be a serious values dissonance as it is not fair to endanger soldiers by letting them be ill prepared 
Feminism,1615790080,True Also lots of predators do this on purpose to get women to trust them or they do it b c they feel guilty about their own misogyny on some level

Feminism,1615787139,The most powerful common act I ve seen men do to other men to keep them in check from abusing  amp threatening women is  the Look   I ve seen my son s and other men divert the mal intention of some men with the look that says  you ll have to move through me before I let you hurt her  If you aspire to be a  not all men man you ll have to challenge those  some men often with your eyes and be ready to back it up with the physical  I ve been around long enough to know that that is how the human race rolls  Do you have the buy in to fight for it

Feminism,1615784296, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action

Feminism,1615808496,I remember being shown Ways of Seeing at the beginning of art college It really rocked my world view that day and as a guy it was my first serious exposure to feminism 
Feminism,1615807968,Similar with those  But I m a good guy and  I would never have never do done something like that guys You re a good guy until you re not You haven t raped someone until you have You wouldn t attack someone until you could It s like they don t understand that most of the  bad guys look like good ones and probably think they are good until they get an opportunity Until they get angry Until they think they re entitled to something Until they can say  it s her fault and get away with it It s easy to say  I d never rape someone if you don t consider most types of rape to be rape 
Feminism,1615807558,I have never heard the term penophobia and I couldn t find a dictionary definition either could you explain it to me 
Feminism,1615807031, gt I talked to a few different men about sexual harassment two laughed  about it one changed the subject one defended the haresser the other one  said You can t say anything to women these days  At least you tried talking to them I am probably going to make a notion resources for feminism and sexual harassment so I can give it to people in my uni
Feminism,1615807007, gt Having ones victimhood challenged What do you mean by this 
Feminism,1615804720,This   This doesn t reference any particular group of people as being the source of the problem This was not an attack on men 
Feminism,1615803224,Gotta say if the feminist group wants more men then why not change the language from  men are rapists to  too many women are being raped  It s understood in both that it s mostly men who are raping women but the second one has a better chance of getting normal men to join the cause
Feminism,1615802737,Not sure if you read OP s question before it was but he specifically asked  how is this  it s not all men but we don t know which men different from saying not all black people but we don t know which black people  I provided examples on how it s not the same and how that felt like an obfuscation and a dogwhistle Comparing yourself to a maginalized and oppressed class when it s convenient to spin a narrative while ignoring the systematic injustices against said class versus the systematic advantages to another to smokescreen and counter an argument that men commit violent crimes against women and try to whattabout the argument into race baiting nonsense is really scummy to do on a board about women s issues and the amount of mental gymnastics required to say  you aren t allowed to talk about your safety or the danger men pose because it s akin to racism is absurd As to your point nobody is going to ask whether or not crossing the street to avoid a man is racist if that man is black versus white except for people fixated on that person s race so your scenario is a bit confusing Are you implying a woman who won t cross the street to avoid white men but will cross the street to avoid black men and women Yes that s racist  If a woman crosses the street to avoid a man regardless of race she s doing what society expects of her to  keep herself safe as it always comes back to when a woman is harmed  She should have been more aware of her surroundings she should have dressed differently she should have crossed the street when she saw someone approaching her she should have blah blah blah and other ways it s not the man s fault for harming her but her own fault for existing But then people want to say  not all men  despite it being a woman s fault for not suspecting it could be all men It s an absurd circular argument that could go round and round forever and everyone is tired of hearing it So to me and a lot of other people it s all men and that s not an issue of privelage or class it s a societal mandate issued by the government who refuses to prosecute men for their behaviors and teach women how to be afraid rather than teach men not to be abusers Women must keep themselves safe because the answer from policing and government agencies when they don t is  she should have suspected all men and acted in accordance with that  
Feminism,1615802690,Precisely What is it about the barrel that allowed the existence continued survival then the thriving spread of the rot 
Feminism,1615801609,Having ones victimhood challenged because men feel embarrassed guilty seems more unfair No women or feminist are saying all men are murderers Like all metaphors it doesnt explore the whole picture  but it adequately explains the concept that male violence and the risk men pose to women can be real without it affecting all women and all men 
Feminism,1615800899,I think the analogy is really powerful At first I thought it was dehumanizing but on second thought I realized it really wasn t it wasn t blaming men or comparing men for ticks it was just explaining the mindset of women who suffered through interactions with toxic and predatory men BUT it s so hard to realize it sometimes I understand that it s not a real comparison but It s kind of triggering to think you re being compared to bugs given that dehumanizing campaigns around the world have compared other groups to insects 
Feminism,1615800413,How is fighting generalisations missing the point ACAB literally stands for all cops are bastards and is not a term that should be said People are capable of understanding unjust acts whiles also disagreeing with people that throw about generalisations that apply to a whole group That s called prejudice 
Feminism,1615798542,Men don t care about you  you re the same as us you ve just got a hole instead of a shaft  nothing special It s  not  our  responsibility  to  be  your  caretakers   Do women care when men are publicly morally and financially raped in the family court system   when men are forced to give up half or more of their current future earnings their assets their house their estate their vehicle and custody of their children Do women care when men are raped sexually abused by women   or is it just played off as a joke  ahem  Cardi B  This isn t about equality or justice  it s about unjustly accusing a specific group of people of being sexual predators when in fact they most certainly are not Men don t owe you a thing We don t owe you protection we don t owe you support and we certainly don t owe you our decency 
Feminism,1615798032,That s why man need to talk to other man and make clear that this kind of behavior is not acceptable
Feminism,1615840961,Sorry I m not buying it  The dude is proud of himself for pissing off  snowflakes  calls himself an asshole like it s a badge of honour and his excuse is that he has trust issues The fuck exactly do trust issues have to do with him thinking he s entitled to comment on what women wear   This guy does not come across as someone who respects women He maybe nice to you but I bet that would change pretty quickly if you started to behave in ways that don t align with his vision of what women should be like 
Feminism,1615840075,What in your mind is the threshold for statistical significance aka what percent of a crime being committed by x group would qualify as something to be afraid of 
Feminism,1615840047,Women have been catering our narratives to men s fragility for fuckin generations and we are OVER IT  If a man isn t willing to be an ally unless we are nice to him he s not an ally at all 
Feminism,1615839094,As I said in another comment he has reasons behind this and I don t think he does either but he also is definitely on the quieter side with most of his opinions And this is the only one I disagree with because he is mostly a feminist he admits that men were assholes in the past And that there are still some who are This is his only flaw If it wasn t I would of already called him out on it 
Feminism,1615838879,He really is this is literally his one flaw He has reasons with it though He s protective because past girlfriends have seriously hurt him and have done awful things to him He had a girlfriend who would rub it in his face that she would stay up late face timing other guys He has trust issues and believes more risqu clothes should be reserved for only intimate partners I agree partly but I also think people should wear whatever they want as long as it isn t straight up nudity

Feminism,1615838434,And then of course since you re the only one speaking up obviously you re the problem 
Feminism,1615838105,One thing you can do is share articles and studies about sexual violence and aggression on social media  be willing to put your face and name behind these issues and amplify women s voices  Be conscious of the language you use and that is used around you when talking about issues that disproportionately affect women Always be willing to learn Know when to shut it and listen Use your voice to amplify women s voices and call out harmful ones  When you consistently behave like an ally women will become more comfortable telling you about their experiences and you may end up learning some surprising things about men you always thought were decent Be prepared to learn those things and considerate of how you respond to what women tell you  Be willing to lose friends over their treatment of women

Feminism,1615835889,Why does it have to be  men in the first place When talking about female harassment and other issues why is it always  men did this etc Do you say humans are killers because some are murderers Or do you call them murderers Why do feminist posts need to begin with  men instead of saying harassers rapists etc Why drag a whole gender into it Is it ok to call all muslim terrorists 
Feminism,1615835197,we already know we really really do But criminals exist most men would help any person in danger but most criminals dont do criminal things with witnesses around   
Feminism,1615834769,Holy crap me too kind of I wrote my dissertation on the depiction of the female nude with the main focus on  Olympia by  douard Manet During my research I came across John Berger He helped me a hell of a lot I still quote him to this day 
Feminism,1615833496, gt you tell him they buddy I don t accept that kind of behaviour He will literally never do it again the shame to lose face in front of another man I take your point that men who abuse women are generally more concerned about their reputation among men than what any woman thinks of them e g a lot of rape culture is about focusing more on notches on bed posts and establishing an identity as a guy who can  score  than focusing on whether she really wanted to  I am afraid this isn t such a silver bullet though Maybe I ve gone about it wrong but it feels like I m just as likely to be accused of something along the lines of  white knighting  It sucks I still feel like it s my responsibility to speak up and I ve long since given up on wanting to  fit in with such crowds but that just makes me more of an outsider to them It s a hard problem 
Feminism,1615828811,Well yes I don t think everyone is going to     agree on whether a particular group is a minority   gt If we validate that kind of reasoning we validate it in general not just in this case so we also do those bigots a favor I think this is a slippery slope fallacy and not quite true We should always qualify whether a group is a minority based on statistics shared experiences and common sense I don t think every claim at being a minority should be validated but some will be If when we a consensus on the qualification the logic still applies 
Feminism,1615827900,It s not just about one thing happening three times though It s patterns of behaviour that are all quite obviously rooted in male socialization Rape is just one example I stand by my argument that distrusting men is not the same as prejudice 
Feminism,1615827533,I mean almost all serial killers are white almost all prostitutes are women Not sure the stats on airplane terrorism but if someone showed me stats indicating that almost all airplane terrorists are Muslim or some other category I wouldn t say  Ok I m now comfortable with TSA strip searching all Muslims  You can t say just because most X are Y that therefore most Y are X probability doesn t work that way  Also if you ve ever heard someone try to justify racist beliefs it sounds exactly like your last paragraph  My house got broken into  times and every time the thief was  insert skin color or demographic here  so now I don t trust those people

Feminism,1615822971,Would you like it if somebody wrote  Women are disease ridden bugs   
Feminism,1615822413,I see what you re saying but the statistics do demonstrate that      of rapists are men while there are no statistics to demonstrate that nearly all thieves are black people or that nearly all child molesters are gay If we knew that      of child molesters were from a certain group  orientation race  of course we would keep kids away from that group And even if that rape statistic didn t exist if a woman has had numerous experiences with violence harassment from men and so have all her friends I think that s enough evidence of danger to justify that  prejudice  
Feminism,1615821402,It s a tricky subject because you re absolutely right that women are just protecting themselves from a very real potential threat but when it is advocated so broadly as it is here it feels like trying to carve out an exception just for one circumstance When THEY do it it s prejudice When WE do it it s just protecting ourselves What about people who cross the street or clutch their purse around black people or refuse to trust their money to financial advisors based on their ethnicity or protect their children by not allowing them to be around gay people They all think they re just guarding themselves from a very real threat The only argument you could make to those people is to say  No no but my stereotype is true I m right about this group over here you re just mistaken about THAT group being bad  Your point about focusing on behavior and social structures is dead on well put

Feminism,1615864420,I m not buying it either   Not even nudity should be inherently sexualized 
Feminism,1615863034,You mentioned that you don t blame guys for this because they grew up with that Implying that boys grow up thinking a certain way  amp I feel like you giving it a negative connotation In you negative experience with someone flirting with you I don t know how pushy the guy was so I can t judge you on your personal experience but if you handled it with an aggressive matter that it didn t match the guys approach then I would consider it fiesty as well But considering you were underage he s a dumbass When it comes to jokes it just depends how much you take it personally I ve had people roast me  amp talk shit but I dont care at the end of the day because their words don t affect me  I don t let it get to me No matter what it is But that s me it just depends how vulnerable you are to things like that I mean if someone has an opinion of you being  feisty it WAY DIFFERENT FROM  ALL MEN SHOULD DIE   Those are two completely different scenarios one of them could possibly potentially dangerous Saying all men should die is threatening it could signal that the person could have a mental illness I mean most hate crimes occur off such word like that  Calling someone  fiesty is not even close to ALL MEN SHOULD DIE  Quite an extreme example Hoodies sweatpants  amp sandals are quite extreme tbh but it doesn t mean that there still ain t some sort of parameter that both females  amp males should follow I mean at the end of the day he s a man Men are attractive to women SURPRISE Obviously if he sees a model on ig he s going to naturally be attracted to it Of course if he s a heterosexual or bi You can t blame him for admiring female beauty But see the difference is models are paid to do their job  amp there job is to look  attractive  I bet that he wouldn t marry someone like that tho because men are very selective with whom they want to be with for the rest of their life So that s where the whole women should act like ladies comes into play Because if your not a model you shouldn t be so explicit That s goes for both men  amp women I mean many men are upset of this feminist movement where they feel like they are being generalized as something they aren t I mean having women generalize that men are rapists violators  amp sex offenders does hurt men to hear because not all of us participate in that horrendous behavior Many of us do put a stop to it  amp call it out even if its with the  boys  Guys know when guys are being assholes some of us do control  amp tell the homies to back off So when you got people coming at you or your type of people it hurts It does affect our gender to have to deal with such harsh claims 
Feminism,1615860218,Dude that s not it at all did you see my other messages  I said I absolutely do not blame guys for this Heck I ve had this conversation with him before and we ve agreed and disagreed He talks the exact way We both blame society for both genders being f caked up Today he talked to me about it the same exact way he didn t change his opinion at all And with school dress codes people took that Too far Why do they still consider knees and shoulders offensive Why is that still a thing And I was defensive back because he started with the defense in some messages previously before the ones in the photos If guys can be defensive we can too Also just because they re  jokes doesn t mean there isn t more behind that Calling it a joke doesn t completely cover everything up That s why jokes are offensive because there is Always something behind it There was a guy who was hitting on me he was over age and I m underage and I made that Very prevalent to him and when I told him off for continuing he called me  feisty because I told him he was wrong  He s allowed to have an opinion but what if certain opinions are blatantly wrong like morally and logically wrong In every way It may seem right to that person because that s how opinions work but what if someone says  all men should die would you like that opinion Would you think that s morally and logically correct Also I said I partially agree with his opinion that intimate clothes should be kept with romantic partners But that doesn t mean all women should only wear hoodies sweatpants and sandals Because that s what he thinks But then he s always sending photos of these girls wearing straight up lingerie for likes and says it s hot   He can t make up his mind I have dealt with this opinion for a while now but I got fed up of him saying it Over and Over and Over again saying girls are all thots and such And him purposely being sexist and purposely upsetting his friends over it for fun when it s clearly a subject that has an affect on our gender 
Feminism,1615859711,Right I agree with most of what you said except for   gt Capitalism may be part of it but non veganism is the real issue You basically answered it below that sentence the only way you get to decommodifying animals and liberating the exploited whether animal or human is by first collapsing capitalism If everyone became Vegan there d still be very poor treatment of animals regardless because of industries that use animals for products however if capitalism falls we are able to start a transition to decommodifying products and necessities if you want to go further we can move to growing meat in labs we have already done it but capitalism prevents us from actually making it something to sell on the market This way you have a transition to a free er and more ethical society

Feminism,1615852984,Yes but in the context of the discussion I think more men would be willing to acknowledge systemic violence against women if those issues were also acknowledged  I think many men see statistics on abuse etc and think of it as something they would never do which in their mind diminishes the severity Educating people about why violence against women is still so widespread can help change their perspective

Feminism,1615848361,I define sexual exploitation roughly as using another sentient being for their sexuality reproductive system or sexual capacity in some way whether by overt or subtle force  One need not actually derive pleasure sexually from the exploitation that they are forcing on someone else  e g farmers in the dairy industry do not necessarily get pleasure from it but they still do it  That definition can be refined but I am referring to essentially the ideal of viewing the sentient being as an object and specifically a sexual one What I mean by women betraying other women women who would themselves be at risk of the suffering I am referring to but still choose patriarchy over doing the right thing Women who do FGM Women  and everyone  who aren t vegan Women who traffick other women  or men or children or whoever is being trafficked  Women who join in on misogyny when they are around male friends   amp  x   B I am not referring to someone sexualizing themselves but that may be a part of it Mainly I was referring to the systemic exploitation of women and especially female animals Capitalism may be a part of it but non veganism is the real issue The solution is a paradigm shift in which women are viewed as legal persons and not as objects and a world in which animals have legal personhood and are not used as commodities in any way 
Feminism,1615848231,He literally doesn t do shit He doesn t care Conservatives need to be make obsolete in Australia or else we will be going around in circles 
Feminism,1615847930,I agree with everything here however I have some questions What do you mean by sexual exploitation What do you mean by women betraying other women In my mind I know what sexual exploitation is being forced convinced that doing something you re uncomfortable with sexually because it s  empowering  however I think there s a difference between someone choosing to sexualise themselves and someone who s actively being forced or persuaded into objectification  With that said I think the only way to solve everything you mentioned is to abolish capitalism once that falls you ll see other oppressive entities falling as well with the rise of socialism 
Feminism,1615847024,We need a name for them that sticks like gorilla glue You need to stigmatize that behavior 
Feminism,1615844417,The main reason that  is used is when generalizing statements are applied to men eg   men are killing women  Although the intent of the writer is probably to say  some too many men are killing women  without that modifier in front the true meaning of the statement is that  men in general are killing women I think that men have a right to defend themselves from statements like the one above that generalize the entire gender Generalizing statements are not really fair when applied to anyone and usually result in unnecessary prejudice and judgement   Not all     are       but enough of them are  is not really a good rebuttal in my opinion You cannot justify generalizations about groups of people just because they may be accurate in some cases Try filling in those blanks with any other identity group besides men and it becomes clear why men respond defensively If a muslim hears    Not all muslims are wife beaters but enough of them are  used as justification in order to group them in with wife beaters they will defend themselves from that prejudicial generalization 
Feminism,1615843216,No it isn t too many More than    of men have never done anything like that You keep defining them by their gender instead of their actions Call them bullies catcallers and rapists but stop generalizing a population of over  billion based on the actions of less than    of it If you want to define criminals by their gender no woman should ever be fit to be a parent because the majority of child homicides and child abuse is done by women But when it comes to them you rightfully call them abusers and murderers instead of generalizing them by their gender Give us the same courtesy

Feminism,1615841754,If he is generally a kind supportive partner then I d be inclined to assume this is just a bit of a blind spot for him and a very clumsy attempt to make you feel less scared  My fiance is a good listener and tends not to give unsolicited opinions on stuff but he has his blind spots and he can be pretty useless emotionally sometimes lol  The important thing I ve found is to just tell him when what he is doing  or not doing isn t hitting the mark For example he tends to just want space when he is stressed out or emotional so his tendency is to give me space  ie basically ignore me when I m emotional  At first I found that incredibly hurtful but over time we both learned that we just have different knee jerk approaches to things so we need to ask for what we want Now when I m emotional or upset and I want to be comforted I just tell him that   I m really upset right now and I want you to listen to me and comfort me  It sounds so ridiculous but it works and he does a great job And when he needs space and I m all up in his business trying to get him to tell me all his feelings he asks me to please just let him do his thing In your case I d suggest you tell him that the way he responded made you feel dismissed and that you want him to be more open to listening to your perspective on issues that affect you as a woman like being afraid to walk alone at night See how he responds to that If he gets defensive call him out on it and bring the focus back to you just trying to be heard and have your emotional needs met 
Feminism,1615841712,This is what I always think whenever NotAllMen stuff comes up These men act like rape is the only issue we care about and that it exists in a vacuum Rape is propped up and encouraged by the things listed in this tweet  it exists within the context of rape culture which exists within the context of patriarchy This is a system that we are all apart of and we have all perpetuated at some point in our lives Solutions come from admitting our faults and working to change the system  not drowning out conversation by shouting about how good and innocent we are

Feminism,1615880706,Because gender and the power imbalance between the genders are intrinsic to violence against women and the reason it is allowed to continue  Terrorism is not intrinsic to islam  its intrinsic to extremist ideals and various other factors   If you dont see that but would rather get upset that we have to share the responsibility of the benefits we receive from a patriarchal society that calls women hysterical when they report abuse refuse to prosecute men because her word isnt enough and then imprison them when they act in self defence I m afraid there is little point in this discussion

Feminism,1615868858,So if I m understanding the question Should people be more afraid in a financially poor high crime area I think we can disregard race but obviously people will use that as an excuse to single people out Violent crime is clearly one of symptoms of poverty but it isn t a limiting factor You don t need to be poor to have power and abuse it I think maybe violence is the most accessable form of power So in a poor community violence or at least the threat of it is a quick and easy way to have power where you otherwise have very little Of course you have the flip side where the powerful can use violence simply because they have power I think the relationship is all other things being equal  which they are not  most men have the availability to exerte power over most women in the form of and threat of violence Maybe poor communities are the same in that regard The greater potential for violence is baked into the society if you will  And well not all fear is rational We are certainly all afraid of things that will do us no harm We are also unafraid of things that can or will do us harm But the the perceived potential causes very real fear Sometimes that fear is rooted in bad things like racism Anyway don t listen to me too much I ve written and this about four times now My points feel week and I m not even sure I know what I m saying But you put some time and effort into your post and I wanted to reciprocate Hopefully this is far enough down in an old enough post no one else will ever read it

Feminism,1615917383,Honestly is not that much different from any other form of fiction Japan has never been specially on the vanguard of feminism equality and many animes are at its core the product of just one person s mind which can be flawed and I believe the majority are men There s also the clich and vicious circle of being written for male audiences which alienates female audiences which in turn feeds the male audience excuses I believe it ll get better as every other media has 
Feminism,1615916098,Actually you re right Thanks for understanding my point as well I was just thinking that since not everyone would actively help someone who gets assaulted by which I mean that if it happens on the street the big majority of people would just turn their backs it s a pretty relevant thing if they actually call the police or help in any other way  But yeah there are also cases in which it s only the bare minimum such as like you said speaking up against racism or correcting a friend for rude jokes

Feminism,1615915316,Or make a nonsense naturalist argument and make silly comparisons to animals  like chimps where males are supreme you know how like people   th century justified colonialism and slavery 
Feminism,1615910985,I agree in some ways and not in others First of all everyone going vegan would result in animal exploitation industries to collapse and move to other alternatives since no one is paying for their services And if a tipping point is reached and not everyone is vegan they may be toppled sooner Whether or not capitalism is also toppled may be irrelevant and even if capitalism is toppled that does not mean that the world will be vegan Most anti capitalists are not vegan and and most discussions about capitalism are done by people currently using animals as resources They are willing to give up capitalism but if asked no way would they give up their animal products The underlying beliefs that animals should be used as resources for food clothing food and experimentation is not necessarily a capitalist idea but rather an imperialist and colonial idea that others should be slaves  might is right  capitalism comes later  Therefore we need to get rid of the underlying speciesist belief first and anti capitalism cannot be divorced from that AOC is against capitalism and she s not advocating veganism as a moral baseline Bernie Sanders is against capitalism but no way would he give up  his animal products

Feminism,1615986081,Totally and utterly disagree  We can always refine and improve how we communicate these things and in order to do that you often need to try to express an alternate view 
Feminism,1615983673,I think a lot of it also has to do with inherent habits that have become normalized for instance the locker room talk Men do it amongst themselves and talk about such horrible things but aren t called out in fact the popular verdict  men will be men is thrown around Well men are being allowed to become misoginists 
Feminism,1615981271,First of all most developing countries in the world sustain themselves off of vegan staples such as beans rice legumes grains Meat and dairy is a luxury Of course there are some people who simply cannot access any good food at all but that s not a why veganism is flawed argument that s just another way in which our global food system is injust  to animals and to humans clearly  As well we currently have enough food to feed   billion people but we choose to use those crops to fatten up animals whom we then murder  turning them into products that go primarily to well off individuals in the west If we care about the fair distribution of foods globally veganism is the only coherent option Can you go vegan Are you vegan Often people point out someone else s disadvantage as a way to say  well that person over there is disabled poor etc and they can t go vegan therefore I am not going to go vegan  This is illogical and it s also selfish to use someone else s disadvantage to justify your own inaction I agree toppling capitalism would be beneficial but again it s an ideology of non veganism that is the primary issue I agree humans need to be liberated as well but that also translates to  We are humans who oppress and slaughter billions of animals and I refuse to liberate those animals until I have my own freedom  We can all choose to not oppress animals by being vegan and most people can go vegan  And if they can t go vegan there are things that are not related to their diet that they can do not go to circuses not buy pets unless they re adopting not buy fur and leather etc  And yes getting rid of speciesism is a huge step in the right direction because that would mean everyone or most of the world has gone vegan and therefore there simply isn t any demand for animal exploitation because everyone has declared  I am vegan I will not willfully participate in animal use and so all corporations and countries would be forced to change  of course it s more complicated  Again there aren t many anti capitalists who are vegan and those leading the political fight  Bernie AOC in the American case would not further veganism since it s not something they perosnally practise

Feminism,1615968872,I  think that by adding cloths it s not possible to find any solution and that  the solution actually goes in the reverse way to remove them without clothing it s not possible to define what s provocative to wear so the  provocation moves to the behavior that is the best definition And actually when people is full naked  in a naturist nudist environment gender differences blur out and on top it removes sexuality that is the other  driver of inequality 
Feminism,1615967662,Disclaimer I am not a feminist I am all for equality but I do not associate myself with the feminist movement in any regard I just enjoy having discussions with people who disagree with me on contraversial topics Disclaimer  electric boogaloo I also haven t watched JoJo s Bizarre adventure I ve seen the character designs though I completely understand your point of view on JoJo s Bizarre adventure the female characters are complete sexualisation and it s disgusting But the male characters also incredibly sexualised  from what I ve seen there might be some characters who aren t  they re all tall muscular jaw lines and confidant looking in posture and body language Sexualisation goes both ways but from what I ve seen one people will tend to only see it towards their gender When I m watching marvel films for example I honestly don t notice the sexualisation of the female characters but I see the sexualisation in the male characters eg Captain America and Thor Now I completely agree that JoJo s Bizarre adventure is too sexualised but it goes both ways and I just ask that when anyone calls out sexualisation they take a look to see if the both genders are sexualised because most often both are 
Feminism,1615967649,It s called  hetero patriarchy  The vast majority of healthy population want a system based on social justice and that of course includes no abuse nor discrimination However a minority wants to keep privileges and for that it s critical to them to abuse the rest and avoid the logical rebellion  This is very hard to sell as such so the narrative works a lot better when it s sold as an abuse chain  So the   privileged class abuse the     but to a percentage      of that    there is giving the other half to abuse The first half are the men and the second are women To the men is told that to protect their privilege above women they must also protect the   privilege And most men bought it Of course that   also spike it with more stuff like nativism racial privilege etc   but the thing is it s really easy to give to each man a woman to abuse because the proportion is     It s not so easy to give to each male a racial slave So women abuse works very well Then the rest of the narrative it s just for filling in victim gaslighting extremism labeling to whoever points the reality intimidation to shut up and keep playing that impossible to win game etc

Feminism,1615957322,Conservatives always think that law protect them from being held accounted from their abuses and crimes One thing is law another is justice He is a rapist and very probably he destroyed his victim career to get away with it Who knows if he is also a murder on that  mysterious suicide of his victim after she decided to present charges And who knows of many other women he was rapped  And on top of that if he is innocent why is using his political position to sue everyone to obstruct the investigations and attacking frontally everyone that wants to known the truth

Feminism,1615952525,It is not possible for everyone to go vegan there are people who can barely afford basic greens thus are restricted to cheap food Not to mention when you live a life that s stressful like that they won t break away from something that gives them a bit of pleasure Capitalism being toppled means there s more incentive for ethical ways of consuming things like I said the chances are there d be more of a push to have lab grown meat and it would be beneficial to have that since no animals will be harmed  I disagree you can t just get rid of speciesism and go from there it s not pragmatic I d need to see evidence that it is in order to see that as another option of toppling the oppressive society  I think our goal should be to liberate fellow human beings first as long as there s a large power above us they ll make it harder and harder to allow people to go vegan why Because it puts a dent in profit people are addicted already and with busy schedules of the working class most people cannot afford to go into the vegan lifestyle right now

Feminism,1616874278, gt One of the interesting points not illustrated in this graph is that the amount of money an occupation pays is significantly related to the  of men in it Well of course it is it s an average of all jobs whether male or female dominated Of course summing this up will show that men make more because there are more fields dominantly men than there is women and the men in those positions are making more than the women in other fields of work How is that unfair   gt It s that work that is thought to be masculine is more inherently valued than work that s thought to be feminine These issues are certainly related but it s interesting to see how deeply the pay gap is integrated into the workforce Have you done any research into why the gender pay gap exists There s many more variables than just simply men make more Ive  worked in the trades with women who make the same as I do can t produce the same as I do but still are paid the same the same as men who can t necessarily produce the same There are many female dominated disciplines where women are paid very well the same as men sometimes more The pay gap is more complicated than just simply it s not equal men make more than women  Take nursing for example predominantly female paid very well not more or less than men in the field but based on their time in the field to a cap then raises with the rise of inflation the same as their peers Equally governed trades which are    dominated by men women are not paid less they are paid the same but you have to introduce more variables than just masculine vs feminine valued work to get a more conclusive depiction of why there is a   wage gap Search any countries occupational breakdown by gender and you ll see the clear divide of which gender fill jobs more than others and if you understand the major differences between men and women as a whole you ll know why the gap exists we are different in two such ways that s makes us choose certain careers But you also have to take into account simply this     do women want jobs in these fields that are dominantly men most cases no If it was the latter you would be forcing equality of outcome and I don t think anyone wants that in a world where many factors decide who gets a job and the opportunity Women who are firefighters when compared to men make the same amount of money or have the same opportunity to make the same money Not all women want to be firefighters you need to be a certain type of person to work in the field women aren t built for it the same as men biologically speaking they don t have the same muscle mass testosterone aggressiveness   but does that mean for the women who do work in those fields do they get paid less of course not  I just fail to see where your argument and frankly anyone else who doesn t see the clear divide of male dominated work that is more masculine being paid more Well of course because there are more men working in the field so naturally they will be paid more as a collective driving the average up    Is it so hard to believe that Childcare workers for example are predominantly women     and those women are in that position cause they want to be there or dental assistants which make up       How come more men aren t in that line of work I m sure Burly Lumberjack Bill wants to be a childcare worker    no he doesn t because he s aggressive by nature and women dominate those fields because they have more compassion and you don t want aggressive Bill playing around in your mouth There are      Carpenters in Ontario compared to      dental assistants Should the carpenters get paid more than the dental assistants in terms of job not by the determination of masculinity or femininity but danger of the job working in the elements Of course they should and it just so happens that it is a very labor intensive job would a large percentage of the female population do that job    no it takes masculine traits now whether you agree or not the fact is biologically it is a masculine job does that mean that females are inherently undervalued to perform such work No they choose not to do to such work There is an inherent difference when it comes to equality of outcome and equality of opportunity Misreading something that isn t fact and projecting it as something else is not understanding or educating yourself properly on the issue

Feminism,1615990989,I m all ears to hear your  well thought out position about how sexual assault and racism aren t bad 
Feminism,1615990887, gt For me I appreciate devil s advocate in a scenario where I don t know exactly where I stand but I want to press the person to explain more why their position is appealing But this often results in bad faith arguments because the person is arguing a position they don t hold often by claiming a position of authority that they don t actually possess It s much more honest imo to just say  I m not entirely sure on my position yet My concerns with your perspective is x y z  That sort of articulation is helpful in building the trust and respect you describe 
Feminism,1615990855,What do you think sexual assault is Also I m still waiting to hear the  racism is ok sometimes nuanced argument  And the  sexual assault is acceptable when argument  
Feminism,1615990712,How about devil s advocate as a tool to find a more nuanced position for yourself This must be expressed in a respectful way in a context of trust but surely in such a scenario it can be useful to express tropes  which possibly you are inconclusive on to a person in order to allow them to better explain a well thought position to someone less well thought 
Feminism,1615990565,The original tweet doesn t reference  rape is bad it says there can be no devil advocate position surrounding sexual assault or racism So that is to say that in no way is their nuance to be found in how every single person thinks about every aspect of both those concepts Obviously nonsense 
Feminism,1615990365,lol can t argue that i m not a white dude having theoretical discussions however the idea that a white male is not impacted by gender sexism and the discussion surrounding those concepts is total nonsense It s a shame that there are some who would wish to respond to those who take an interest in experience outwith their own as attempting to frustrate them purely because they defend the concept of an honest devil s advocate 
Feminism,1615990187,Right here     Completely and utterly disagree to      Without genuine trust and respect though it is true devil s advocate is useless in any scenario even more so in ones where the knowledge produced is used to oppress and subjugate as knowledge associated with race and gender often is     You asserted something to be devils advocate to the OP Then you backed off of it immediately proving that your first assertion was the  bad kind of devils advocate 
Feminism,1615989974,How have I abandoned the position My position is that devil s advocate CAN be useful Where have I abandoned that argument 
Feminism,1615989741,So    what s the alternate to  rape is bad   racism is bad  Do tell 
Feminism,1615989730,Your first comment completely disagree when discussing racism and sexual assault we  absolutely need someone to play devils advocate    Your second comment playing devils advocate can be beneficial in some scenarios but there s a nuance to it    Pick a lane friend 
Feminism,1615989366,So when you  play devil s advocate  you re quite literally repeating the status quo telling us stuff that we already know  because not only do we too live in this space and time and therefore comprehend the norms of this cultural and historical place but we also are actively thinking outside of that box which first requires us to know that box really really well And you re not so radically reinforcing that we should remain in that box  
Feminism,1615989327,Devil s advocate does not have to be a case of someone asserting themselves then abandoning a position but I agree there are many who do that For me I appreciate devil s advocate in a scenario where I don t know exactly where I stand but I want to press the person to explain more why their position is appealing For example as a kid at a Catholic school the anti abortion message was drummed in quite hard Abortion was something I struggled to take a coherent position on in which I was always comfortable but it was noticeable that the science led of my peers were pro choice To pick their brains without knowledge of biology it was necessary for me to say  It is impossible for you to define logically when is fine to abort and when is not if you ignore the point of conception as that line in order to access their knowledge of the reality of the development of the fetus in the early stages as basically a tiny clump of cells and not a living human being in a womb Without genuine trust and respect though it is true devil s advocate is useless in any scenario even more so in ones where the knowledge produced is used to oppress and subjugate as knowledge associated with race and gender often is 
Feminism,1615988852,No I don t believe these deaths include homicide I ve seen it anywhere from homicide  usually by husband bf lover being the cause of    of all pregnancy related deaths Heart disease being     But numbers may be different now 
Feminism,1615988441,Introducing alternative views sure   but to what end If it s about anticipating counterarguments or adding genuinely needed nuance that s fine but that s not really playing devil s advocate If it s  I m going to assert my intellectual superiority by arguing a position that I don t even hold or that I deny holding when challenged  that s insincere and counterproductive and can do real damage in an organizing context

Feminism,1616930748, Why support feminism instead of simply supporting egalitarianism  There is a  genus species relation between egalitarianism and feminism Feminism is a type of egalitarianism  specifically one of the types of egalitarianism that deal with gender  Equalism or other similar terms never really referred to an actual theoretical discipline an actual coherent protest movement we can t actually speak of a certain egalitarian intellectual history academic texts produced scholarly works ideological currency etc What you have instead is an umbrella term an attribute of several schools of thought  a  trend of thought   without actually being a school of thought in and of itself Egalitarianism is a very very general ideal  basically the most general formulation of social equity which is then further formulated and pursued in more precise terms by various schools of thought actual social movements Therefore movements for the rights of various social groups  women men children LGBT ethnic groups people with disabilities etc  are all components specific manifestations of egalitarianism in actual activist concrete terms A similar answer can be given for feminism s relation with  gender equality  Regarding feminism s relation with  humanism  humanism in particular is an ideology that precludes a theistic perspective while feminism has no such precondition  there exist both atheist feminism and feminist theology   Feminism s relation with the men s movement The definition of feminism is the struggle for gender equality As such we consider it necessary to acknowledge the existence and the legitimacy of men s issues and the need for a movement and a dedicated discussion space to address such issues  Regarding the claim  if feminism was an egalitarian movement there wouldn t be a need for a men s rights movement  Feminism is a collection of egalitarian movements ideologies and theories If we are speaking theoretically then yes feminism would be sufficient as a theoretical approach to deal with men s issues as well If we are speaking practically then everyone is free to get involved  or not in a certain issue regardless of how strongly they feel about it Lack of involvement does not mean opposition by and large all social issues are dealt with by people on a voluntary basis and it is completely up to them to decide how much time energy and money they want to invest and in which issue  without this bringing any sort of blame or fault on such volunteers for being involved in issue A but not on issue B Most people don t get involved in anything at all those who work at least on one aspect deserve recognition for working towards social improvement regardless of their area of action

Feminism,1612446732,Rhea Chakraborty Tragedy    Indian society hates women It hates unmarried good looking women even more There is a reason why women like Draupadi Sita and Shakuntala exist in our literature They are warnings meant to educate you If you re in the wrong place you will be punished and everyone will love to watch you burn Misogyny is a part and parcel of Indian culture It has always been this way and it will always be this way Your biggest asset is your financial independence This is the ONLY leverage you have and will ever have Do NOT sacrifice your education or career for your family or children Invest in yourself invest in your future Keep your finances separate from your partner Do not trust anyone with your money If your husband boyfriend spends money on you try to match it as much as you can Do NOT accept free lunches If your partner is paying for the house you live in it is not your house What belongs to you is only what belongs to you legally Unless you pay the rent  and keep the receipts or have the lease in your name it is not your house It doesn t matter if you have lived in it for  months or   years It is not your house The Indian state is an extension of the Indian family Deeply patriarchal and broken Don t rely on the police media or any kind of state apparatus You need to know that you re vulnerable Only money and power can protect you Acquire those Indian society doesn t believe in love It believes in transactions Indians pay billions of rupees to watch romance on screen but for them it exists only on screen It is entertainment Be careful with who you love Do not devote yourself to men who don t deserve it Shower your love on yourself before you give it to any man What is considered fun for men is considered debauchery for women Indian society doesn t see women as humans who need to relax and enjoy themselves If he smokes weed he is stressed and needs to let loose If you drink alcohol you are a characterless bad influence Remember this hypocrisy and have fun with only those who you trust If you can afford it travel outside India to have fun Learn to think of relationships in terms of sunk costs This is a concept in finance but it applies to life too You don t need to stay in a bad investment just because you invested in it Just because you gave a man  years in your past you don t need to give him  years of your future You can walk away anytime Limit your losses The past is irrelevant to the future If you have to live with dignity on your own terms you have to fight You have to fight everyone and everything You will be crushed often But it is a price worth paying If I can make an appeal PLEASE educate yourself about patriarchy It is a system so deep rooted and insidious that it is often hard to recognize Familiarize yourself with the works of Indian feminists such as Kamla Bhasin You can start with her TED talk here Before I met her I thought people were bigoted and they have to be ignored challenged etc Thank you again PS It s not my original post Credit  u saumyasharmapoo
Feminism,1612426038,As a woman I feel whenever a man gets frustrated or feels threatened they always insult the appearance body I ve noticed this with my friends at college as well It makes me notice more how when men want to hurt women they attack what they have deemed our greatest asset value  our bodies  As if telling women they look unattractive will lower their value as a human In general insulting other people isn t good but it feels especially demeaning and dehumanizing when a woman is arguing with a man and the man dismisses her argument by saying  well she s unattractive     It feels common for men to devalue women s opinions by attaching our worth to our bodies because they believe if we aren t desirable to them our words have no worth  Let me know if anyone has experienced this relates to this it s just something I was thinking about 
Feminism,1612398878,The article   Abstract  In successfully recruiting a portion of its membership from various online communities of white men who feel threatened and rejected by women the Alt Right movement promotes a sense of male entitlement that is easily radicalized and connected to white nationalism and white supremacy While the Alt Right proclaims to be able to offer something of value to the men who join them the movement has never been about helping men cope with low self esteem relationship problems or their personal pain and insecurity How then do we explain its ability to appeal to a certain group of white men  Trolling feminism and progressive or liberal thought the Alt Right has created a culture of vitriolic defensiveness among young white males which aims to establish a common belief in white male victimhood In order to understand its rise we therefore have to examine how the movement in part came into existence as a rejection of the accomplishments of feminism By constructing a complex cultural narrative of male vulnerability the Alt Right has created a uniting collective of men who view the subordination of women as both part of a functional society and a stepping stone to a larger movement one steeped in fascist ideology and willing to openly champion a politics of hate and violence

Feminism,1612341056,Some Important thoughts I d like to share after reading this article on CNN today   LINK        The battle between Liz Cheney and Majorie Greene is two sides of the same coin    This is the complexity of two Patriarchal women who are debating how to  be better at maintaining the patriarchal system the old way of subtlety or the new way of conspiracy   both equally dangerous And let s face it Cheney s  conservatism helped birth Greene s fringe While many might want to praise Cheney for standing up to Greene  we need to realize the  cancer was in the GOP  now GQP long before Greene ever showed up on the scene This isn t a phenomenon this is   the  evolution of what has occurred for a long time    Women   we need to step into our empowerment and push back on both of these women They are powerful yes but they are not empowered w themselves and it s up to us to show up and be willing to change the narrative I have written before White Women are the most potent weapon for the Patriarchal system Because if the system can keep White women deceived into thinking they should not have full autonomy over their own body mind place or that they need permission on any subtle level then Patriarchy wins White Women have a history of enabling the abuse of Patriarchy  Let s recognize this and do an about face Our militancy should be in alignment with the    Abolition Feminist Movement     begun by our Black Brown and Indigenous Sisters Right now the Woman in Congress standing up for and with women is AOC Some of you may be very confused by that if you re been a conservative most of your life but she has been bold enough to share her truth and the truth of     in  Women in the United States      and that s just what s reported and that we know of  The point I m making is we within ourselves need to take on this fight  for the sake of Healing and Justice in our country Remember   Amanda     Gorman     said what  just is isn t always  jus tice  let s change that shall we           More of my Expanded thoughts on White Women s role Hyperlinked Here    
Feminism,1612337409, I was never really told how hard pregnancy was It s often glamorized on social media  movies etc It s a beautiful thing to grow and birth a baby but it s not glamorous I was set up with unrealistic expectations At the beginning I was so sick I could hardly function I remember trying to be strong  force myself to get up every morning  go work   hours a week fearing people wouldn t take my sickness seriously or would see me as weak I remember even the father of my unborn baby would grow tired of me being sick or see me as a burden I lost weight every where and wasn t able to keep down food for about  months On top of that  the anxiety of everything you do effects your baby the hormone shifts loneliness and the worry I began to suffer from panic attacks and uncontrollable sobbing I was worried that I couldn t keep enough food down to allow my baby to get enough nutrients I was worried he could have the same potentially fatal birth defect I did I was worried about getting Covid finances during a pandemic  and so on As my pregnancy continued I eventually got over being so sick however random vomiting  amp nausea never ended The physical pain of growing bigger   sore breasts round ligament pain cramps and contractions The fatigue also never ended You never stop feeling drained I also struggled with finding clothes to wear I always loved fashion and took pride in what I would wear During pregnancy that goes out the window I struggled to find pants because I m tall and skinny Trying to find bras is a nightmare  no one makes a size   E that is reasonably priced My wardrobe consisted on leggings  sweats and baggy shirts  Dressing up could no longer be a reality  Eventually that takes a toll on your confidence It s hard to feel beautiful while in pain  getting bigger and not being able to wear anything you want  There s so much pressure on women to have a  beautiful pregnancy and to never complain But in reality it takes a toll on you physically mentally and emotionally Men call you crazy for being emotional friends think you are dramatic when you say you don t feel up to leaving the house etc it needs to be normalized that pregnancy is not glamorous It s hard work and draining You sacrifice everything about yourself to grow your baby Yes it is worth it and the unconditional love between you  amp baby is worth every second But it s important that pregnancy being miserable  painful  and hard is NORMALIZED

Feminism,1614102605,So for the past few months I have noticed a lot of men talking about the fact that they re puzzled at best and scared at worst when approaching women nowadays At first I thought that s not what the MeToo movement and women speaking up was about surely they must feel guilty about something to say this And then it hit me  it is precisely because a majority of men didn t know how ubiquitous and commonplace harassment is and that they started realising that themselves or their close ones have had misogynistic thoughts and or actions in the past and how deep all of these behaviours go that that discovery was so shocking and upsetting to them Now the problem is some of them are directly blaming women for speaking up because they weren t aware of this before in a classic case of shooting the messenger But if we think of fear and anger as signals that something is wrong and that we have to take these feelings into consideration and do something about the situation then perhaps it s a good thing that they feel that way because it shows that they too find it appalling And disheartening when they find that they have participated in this in one way or another I was brought to these thoughts while reading the book  Sorci res  or  Witches  by Swiss journalist and essayist Mona Chollet  pretty sure most European francophones on this sub know about her  It s a very interesting read and at the end of her book she talks about how mind and body were separated by  male thinkers of the   th century mostly opposing  male rationality and  female emotion  She said that since our way of thinking has not changed much since then we still see emotion as  irrational and to be avoided at all costs and what we think of as an  objective detached fact as the logical and preferred tool to approach our world But the thing is when we witness something horrifying and upsetting it is actually much more logical to be scared and angry than always trying to  take a step back  because some things are too serious and dangerous to only be taken as a  subject of interest to be studied at arm s length What do you think  
Feminism,1614078994,Good Morning Just needed to get a few things off my chest and I think this would probably be the best place to do it Anyway I was a big fan of metal rock music until about a week ago Then I found out what many bands did on tour It turns out that it is  standard operating proceedure for many bands to use the roadies to ask young people  often   year girls and the like backstage for sex generally under the guise of an aftershow party or just meeting the band I consider myself sex positive but my problem with this is that even if it s technically consensual it puts a fan in a position where they could easily be pressured into things they could not have wanted to do It shows someone s character and that they do not respect or have empathy for the fan s position be they male or female I think it s very likely a number of people agreed to sex in these conditions because they felt pressured to by the situation engineered by the band entourage which is not exactly consensual and the professionals in question were either willfully ignorant or straight up taking advantage of that power I still consider it morally reprehensible even if it was consensual using your position as a musician and your ontourage to sleep with generally young impressionable people who look up to you   There are parallels to be drawn behind such bands who use that power and the powerful men who were brought to justice via the metoo movement I ve been in two minds about this I wanted to defend my favs of course and did for few days in my mind  But I myself work in social care and if I saw this happening in front of my eyes I would be disturbed and I can no longer defend it I was also shocked when I saw people posting about it online defending it Like if say a fashion editor was picking out girls in the audience at a modeling show and getting an assistant to ask them backstage for sex I doubt those same people would agree with it Makes me wonder about parasocial relationships and the double standards we are all to quick to give people Look at David Bowie back in the   s he raped a   year old girl  Lori Mattox  She said she consented But morally and legally speaking no   year old can consent Even back in the   s this was considered reprehensible Yet he is not remembered as a child rapist in the way that the reputation of other famous dead artists  you know who I am talking about are or Ian Watkins is I ve been shaken to the core by this Sounds silly but even though I knew about Weinstein types it never really sunk in until I discovered artists I knew were doing this  I suffer from OCD which makes it worse as my mind tries to justify obessesive disturbing thoughts to make myself feel better Anyway thank you for listening to my rant I just wanted to put this out there so others could know I want to do a bit of good in the world To provide a warning to young girls at concerts EDIT Here s a link to an article talking about the experience of female roadies and how they are trying to tackle misconduct in the industry against  fans and staff  
Feminism,1614059272,When a man mentions going to the strip club I find it very off putting  I think it s because they are reinforcing the fact that straight men don t ever see women as actual humans but as beings to serve them in some regard I see them as the men who objectify women the most  However I am happy women have monetised from this and view SW in a positive light   So is it a backwards view I have on the men who go there yet respect the workers  Looking for your perspectives opinions and more  Looking to broaden my thought pattern  Thanks 
Feminism,1614057733,Over the last few years I ve noticed that my YouTube recommended videos have began to become more anti feminist and sexist in nature Like I tend to watch a lot of movie reviews and commentary videos and I began to see videos talking about how Brie Larson is evil and wants to destroy all men or other movies with strong female leads getting completely railed for wanting to have diversity And it s just been so exhausting Even when I try to find feminist videos that are positive and informative especially ones that aren t in the mainstream like Contrapoints Hbomberguy John Oliver or Philosophy Tube it s just a bunch of response videos that perform bad faith arguments against feminism What s worst is that they re popular and can get easily clicks without saying much in particular I m not saying people can t critique certain aspects of feminism like how being a terf can hurt transgender women and men but every video I see that try to argue against feminism it ends up being someone taking a few rare examples and generalizing the entire movement Or if a creator wants to talk about how men face sexism too they ll end up blaming it on feminism rather than the gender roles that are placed on men women and non binary by traditional values Then there are some videos where they ll agree that gender roles are a problem but will discredit feminism by saying that instead of saying women s right we need to just say rights or humanism rather than feminism It s honestly just sad that now saying you re a feminist is a contested issue Rather than being seen as a positive it s now being seen as a negative thing built on the back of straw man s bad faith arguments and misinformation

Feminism,1614303079,Hi all I m not sure how to begin this post  Please keep this discussion respectful and civil I m not exactly sure what to say because I ve never actually contemplated this question before until very recently so please me if I don t articulate my thoughts clearly This thread was created with the intention to welcome anyone to discuss this topic  respectfully and civilly  for me to explore my own stance on this matter  as I ve never challenged it before  and to hopefully get a bit more education from all opinions regarding this topic  If you decide to state facts to support your opinions please provide links to sources that can back you up thanks  Below are some of my thoughts already going into this I m not sure if they ll be beneficial or worthwhile for this discussion but decided to add them in case they were I ve always morally supported sex workers I ve been watching porn since I was young I do believe there is a lot of exploitation and abuse in the porn and sex work industry I also believe there are safe ways for sex workers to make a living or hold a job in that field  even if it may still be considerably riskier than a  normal job  I have loved getting to know myself through watching porn I have found some empowerment through exploring myself via porn I also believe I ve harmed myself in conscious and unconscious ways by consistently viewing porn I believe porn can be both helpful and harmful for society and individuals I am very liberal leaning I am a feminist Lately I ve been seeing a lot of posts on various social media that encourage the support of sex workers education of their industry and protecting people in that field I ve also been seeing posts that condemn the consumption of porn Seeing the mix of these types of posts in my feeds confused me The majority if not all people I follow online have the same views as I do politically and socially and all my friends morally support people in adult entertainment and also watch porn So I guess I was confused to see the condemnation of porn from what I thought were like minded individuals  and I ve never met someone who supported sex workers but disagreed with porn  It got me thinking about what is right and wrong and what I believe So feel free to leave your own thoughts below on the matter Below are a couple questions I ve been wondering to myself and would love to see other people answer  TL DR Is watching porn morally bad even if you re watching someone s who is producing content in a safe and healthy way  Can you support sex workers the adult entertainment industry if you condemn porn If so how  Reminder to keep discussion as respectful and civil as possible If you mention facts in your discussion please try to add a link to your sources 
Feminism,1614280902,I m just wondering how other feminists view male violence and possible causes to that I ve noticed recently that when talking about this topic many women believe it s because of an inherent drive to dominate and have power over others in a way that women don t A woman close to me said that men  biologically want to make others feel bad to feel better about themselves Where I live these sorts of beliefs are somewhat normal and although I agree to a certain degree I feel like it s a bit harsh and derogatory to say stuff like that So I wonder what do you view as possible causes to the overwhelming amount of male violence over female Do you think it s purely biological induced by society or both

Feminism,1614276684,So I know engaging with TERFs isn t exactly helpful but a point I see them bring up is that trans women are a  hideous parody of womanhood  Usually by engaging in an  overperformance of femininity and while I know I won t be able to convince any died in the wool bigots maybe an average person will see this and it ll help them understand See when you re trans you don t exist in a world where it is considered  positive for you to behave in a hyper feminine manner Because by and large being raised in a boys world allows significantly less room for gender variance than growing up as a woman In a lot of way it s one of the great failings of second wave feminism As the ability for men to express themselves in non traditionally masculine ways is not incredibly different from that of the     s People assigned male at birth are still beaten to death for wearing dresses and make up That generally speaking does not happen for women wearing pants As a result your acceptance into broader society as a trans woman is directly tied to your ability to be authentically seen as a woman by your peers And if you don t  pass well enough to be seen as such you better put in the extra effort The punishment for failing to meet these expectations can be extreme Being socially ostracized and feeling unsafe are just the beginning Losing your job losing access to medal care  not just transition related  and violence both physical and sexual are all distinct possibilities So you perform femininity like your life depends on it because it does So the next time you see a  hideous parody of womanhood  Just know that the scorn you may feel is why she is the way she is

Feminism,1614815661,This isn t all feminism but I didn t know where else to post this but it does involve feminism Recently I ve noticed that my boyfriend of just over a month holds opinions that I disagree with I respect people s opinions however they were opinions on women lgbtq  racism etc real people s lives basically This is kind of where I draw the line since I speak from experience when talking about feminism and lgbtq especially and I also have a diverse group of friends So when someone expresses a negative opinion on women for example it gets very personal to me When we discuss these issues he says he normally disagrees with me and when I suggest he educates himself first then he says  that s boring or  it s not important  I try my best to educate him but I can only do so much he has to be willing to learn It s putting a strain on our relationship I don t want to just give up on him because this stuff is so important If i give up on him then he will just continue holding these negative views and opinions

Feminism,1614926019,Does anyone else feel the same way as me Let me explain where I am coming from  TW I do bring up Rape Abuse Virginity and Purity Culture This is a topic that relates pretty strictly to heterosexual cisgender couples so please bear with me Something that has bothered me for some time is the stereotype of fathers threatening their daughter s boyfriends before dates It is often portrayed in movies and television and it is something that I think is still very pervasive in U S society  as well as other societies of course  particularly in conservative and or religious homes I recently had a discussion with my  mostly feminist mom and she just could not see where I was coming from Here is my argument this  protecting of daughters by fathers is super problematic on many levels but the main one is that I think it takes away from the identity of the daughter as her own person She is only someone because of her father and what his protection awards her It is in the same vein as when a woman is attacked for speaking out about rape or sexual harassment and people will say  what if she was your mother daughter sister  It effectively takes away that woman s identity and awards it to the men around her  father brother etc  Each woman is her own person and she should not only be given an identity when it relates to a man in her life Edit I wanted to add one more point  that I believe that the fathers protecting daughters is problematic in that it creates this toxic cycle of men only respecting men boyfriends respect their girlfriends only when they have a father  or brother behind them What happens to the girls who don t have fathers brothers Should they be treated differently because a man isn t threatening to beat up their boyfriends The second reason I find it problematic is because no father  or mother ever says to a girl to be kind to their son that they better not  hurt their son Lots of men have experienced heartbreak from a girl they have dated but this is a non issue To me this is mostly due to purity culture because essentially what father s are really saying when they say  you better not hurt my daughter or else    is you better not have sex with her because virginity is still seen as a virtue and without it a woman is effectively devalued When I spoke with my mom about this she said that fathers doing this is a way of loving and protecting women that because we are the  fairer sex we will always be weaker than men and that is what fathers are worried about But I would argue it is not the safety of their daughters it is once again the virginity that they are worried about No father says don t you even think about killing my daughter hitting my daughter raping my daughter etc I would argue that those horrific things are not even implied  it is solely about virginity and that is why no one cares about their sons being  hurt because virginity and purity are solely in the hands and responsibility of women I would love the input of others and I thought this sub would be a good place to start Does anyone else agree with me or see where I am coming from Or am I way off base 
Feminism,1614923635,So as you probably read I m a lesbian and I just really needed to vent about something here  Obviously there are a lot of misogynistic traditions when it comes to marriage  the bride being  given away  and taking the husband s last name and especially in the past it would just trap women and they would be there husbands and that should be addressed because it s important but sometimes I ll get a bad vibe when that s all feminists  especially straight ones talk about when it comes to marriage Because I ve seen plenty of times where they will just go on and on and on about how marriage is solely benefiting a man without acknowledging the fact that not all women marry men It just feels like they re excluding a major struggle some women have had to face and to me it feels like they re just reinforcing the idea that every marriage is between a man and a woman And not to say marriage is for everyone or you should believe in it But I want to get married and sometimes when I say that to a straight woman and hear that it s just reinforcing patriarchal society it makes me feel icky because I don t plan on marrying a man And I don t think this is necessarily their intentions but it just makes me feel weird  when that s all they say not talking about it in general  Sappics already get excluded so much especially lesbians because we don t pursue men Basically I just wish that if you are straight and addressing the topic to just acknowledge that not all marriages will have a man woman dynamic Sorry I m not really the best with words and I m typing this on my phone but I hope this makes sense and I can t speak for all gay woman but this is just my feelings

Feminism,1614895749,Arguments for and against this mentality I personally fall into certain communities that say things like this a lot but it also sort of implies woman are unable to make any choices without male input  This is a hot topic for why women do SW etc  In particular being in anti porn communities these sorts of statements seem to come off a little weird to me  and they come up often    P S This view is not necessarily my own I m just scared I m reading into swerfy misogynist reddit potentially and would obviously like to not be a part of that 
Feminism,1614882601,Hey feminists of the internet this is just a rant about my dermatology appointment today I was really excited about it but it was one of the worst hospital visits I think I ve ever had When I went into the room a male doctor  still in med school looked at me before my actual doctor He was extremely nice and asked before he touched my face back stomach legs etc and talked to me about what products I was using and all of that stuff When my actual doctor came in she looked at me for maybe  minutes and then decided that we needed to get the accutane process started and that I needed to start birth control and these other  medications along with this topical medicine Additionally when she looked at me she pretty much touched me where ever and pulled down shirt so that she could see if I had boob acne without asking which caught me completely off guard and the male doctor was in the room and I m a minor When she started talking about how I need to be on birth control so that if I get pregnant on accutane my babies won t be deformed I freaked out  as one would  I had just fought my way out of all of these stupid medications that made me feel like crap and she wanted to put me on more   So she asked me if I had any questions and I started crying because I was so overwhelmed She then asked why I was crying and I told her that I didn t want to be on birth control She asked me why and I responded with  because I don t want it to make me more emotional I would have said more but I was having trouble breathing because I was crying so much She then told me that it wouldn t make me more emotional and then asked my mom if she had any questions and then left The male doctor was still in the room and talked to me about how I could just start with the topical medication and that birth control doesn t work for everyone The woman doctor came back with this contract for accutane that I had to sign about how I couldn t have sex for  months I signed it but made sure that It didn t lock me into taking any medication I m just so fed up with doctors

Feminism,1611856535,I m trying to get rid of dress codes across canada and I ve been met with so many responses telling me that dress codes are there to teach being professional and how to chose appropriate dress wear and that the rules are fairly enforced girls just break them more often Oh and my favorite  you want kids running around with thier beasts and asses hanging out  that s perverted  DRESS CODES ARENT EVERYWHERE FOR A REASON  On teaching professionalism we were allowed to wear pajamas and literally anything else because of  freedom of expression but no boobs or thighs Completely contradicts the point  On teaching appropriate dress attire Aparently we dont need to teach this in elementary schools when we learn about the weather or universities where we actually have an idea of what kind of professional we want to be and were practicing getting there because they have no dress code So only in high schools  The problem is that I didnt find myself sexy or even think about boys liking one of my body parts more than another Then I went to school one day and I was sent home because I was violating the dresscode I showed that it wasnt true My principal was wrong I had no one to go to to protect me from him saying that its distracting and they want to protect me I missed math that day because I was sent home I cried all day and I seriously think that shit was traumatizing not to mention the comments girls got when they were violating the dress code and got called to the office I remember a girl in class said that s what they get for being sluts every time they got called  I think the lasting effects that it has on womens self esteem and ideas about the way the world should work isnt worth it I think alot of other countries have accepted that they dont like those results and dont have dresscodes I m so frustrated that it s so hard to convince anyone or get attention on this issue I need your guyses stories  I need this to blow up I want to change the world help me do it

Feminism,1611766369,Hi everyone I m a young male and wondering what I can do to help women and be a feminist 
Feminism,1611766018,The reason I ask this is because it has personally effected me When I was younger  middle school to be exact I went to family court with my parents to see who got custody of my siblings and I I wanted to live with my mom because we had a much better connection than my dad and I had  also my dad did some shitty things so obviously I didn t want to live with him However my dad won custody over my siblings and I so I had to live with him for  years This took a toll on me as he had moved  hour away from where I grew up So I lost a lot of good friends and my dad had put my brother and I in the worst middle school ever   So that was unpleasant I would ve turned out a lot better if I lived with my mom  So now I hate the family court they made me go through hell for  years and I will never forgive that judge But maybe I m just too biased for this argument since my dad isn t the greatest So what are the facts with this argument What makes men oppressed in the family court system because if anything I felt my mom was being very mistreated that day in court

Feminism,1611761424,So I ve stopped removing my body hair in large quantities  like clean shaving anywhere because I ve found the more I do it the more uncomfortable I get  days after shaving waxing I d grow ingrown hairs and get rashes everywhere regardless of the style of body hair removal so I stopped shaving my legs and now I only trim my pubic hair for comfort  and easy deodorant application I stopped for a few reasons it was uncomfortable it was something I felt I had to do    times a week to maintain the  smooth look but I asked myself why I did it and did some researching and found out that majority of the ideas of body hair being  uncleanly or  ugly only applies when it s on women and is deep rooted in social standards and practices such as fashion modelling and  surprise surprise misogyny  After finding out why I was doing it I slowly felt more comfortable going out unshaven but mostly because I never wore short skirts or strapless shirt outside With lockdown it s made me more comfortable but I want to be able to go outside and not fear what others will think or God forbid comment on my underarm hair or leg hair Part of me is scared and the other part of me is confident but I can t help but feel uneasy when I want to wear a skirt outside or wear short sleeves   For context I live in a fairly toxic part of a major city  strong misogynistic views and too much violence and I m a female person of colour  part of me is scared that people would comment on my body hair and relate it to my Black heritage and the not so lovely racism perception of me being a  monkey      TLDR     How did you grow comfortable showing body hair  legs underarms in public

Feminism,1612143187,I like watching rom coms and teen movies because I generally watch movies to relax at the end of the week whereas I read when I want to be challenged However most of these kinds of films are painfully sexist among many other   ist s I really just want to watch films that have a light hearted tone and are about the way people connect with each other romantically or otherwise and those two genres seem the closest thing I can find to doing that I m sick of movies that are depressing or violent As a queer woman who practices relationship anarchy I don t expect to find movies that reflect my values exactly but I was just hoping for something better than the bullshit I find on  top   rom coms listicles I also would like to watch more indie and international films  I m Australian as I don t vibe with most mainstream American humour but I don t know how it is that people hear about those kinds of movies If someone has a recommendation for an American movie that fits the bill though please share anyway even if it s well known My own recommendations for things that others in my position might like include Ladybird Edge of Seventeen Maggie s Plan Juno Little Miss Sunshine An Education and any of the films by the director Hirokazu Koreeda  my favourite movie is his Shoplifters though it s not as lighthearted as the other films on this list Like Father Like Son is a good one to start with   The     version of Madchen in Uniform is good too and queer though it gets dark towards the end I also love You ve Got Mail and I enjoy older British rom coms like Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill The quasi polyamorous set up in part of Bridget Jones Baby was something I enjoyed as well My Australian recommendation is Top End Wedding which is lots of fun and is one of few rom coms I know that isn t from a completely white perspective I m sure there are others who feel similarly to me so all recommendations would be super appreciated 
Feminism,1612139504,I was reading a discussion recently posted about what cis men thought about taking their wife s last name and all were appalled by the mere suggestion of it When reading through the comments there were many who said that neither partner changed their last name when getting married Both kept their last names as a mutual decision But my question applies to those that did get married and never changed their last names and had children but gave their children their husband s last name and not the wife s And I m just curious as to why that decision was made I m not coming from a place of malice I m just very curious about this subject As it happens a lot in hetero couples that aren t married and have children together that the child will nearly always have the father s last name When I tried to find out why I couldn t really get a clear answer and wanted to ask feminists what they thought on the subject  I d love to be enlightened as to why this happens other than the patriarchy because let s be honest the women are doing all the hard work to create a children and they don t even get her last name I just think that s bonkers

Feminism,1612426038,As a woman I feel whenever a man gets frustrated or feels threatened they always insult the appearance body I ve noticed this with my friends at college as well It makes me notice more how when men want to hurt women they attack what they have deemed our greatest asset value  our bodies  As if telling women they look unattractive will lower their value as a human In general insulting other people isn t good but it feels especially demeaning and dehumanizing when a woman is arguing with a man and the man dismisses her argument by saying  well she s unattractive     It feels common for men to devalue women s opinions by attaching our worth to our bodies because they believe if we aren t desirable to them our words have no worth  Let me know if anyone has experienced this relates to this it s just something I was thinking about 
Feminism,1612398878,The article   Abstract  In successfully recruiting a portion of its membership from various online communities of white men who feel threatened and rejected by women the Alt Right movement promotes a sense of male entitlement that is easily radicalized and connected to white nationalism and white supremacy While the Alt Right proclaims to be able to offer something of value to the men who join them the movement has never been about helping men cope with low self esteem relationship problems or their personal pain and insecurity How then do we explain its ability to appeal to a certain group of white men  Trolling feminism and progressive or liberal thought the Alt Right has created a culture of vitriolic defensiveness among young white males which aims to establish a common belief in white male victimhood In order to understand its rise we therefore have to examine how the movement in part came into existence as a rejection of the accomplishments of feminism By constructing a complex cultural narrative of male vulnerability the Alt Right has created a uniting collective of men who view the subordination of women as both part of a functional society and a stepping stone to a larger movement one steeped in fascist ideology and willing to openly champion a politics of hate and violence

Feminism,1612341056,Some Important thoughts I d like to share after reading this article on CNN today   LINK        The battle between Liz Cheney and Majorie Greene is two sides of the same coin    This is the complexity of two Patriarchal women who are debating how to  be better at maintaining the patriarchal system the old way of subtlety or the new way of conspiracy   both equally dangerous And let s face it Cheney s  conservatism helped birth Greene s fringe While many might want to praise Cheney for standing up to Greene  we need to realize the  cancer was in the GOP  now GQP long before Greene ever showed up on the scene This isn t a phenomenon this is   the  evolution of what has occurred for a long time    Women   we need to step into our empowerment and push back on both of these women They are powerful yes but they are not empowered w themselves and it s up to us to show up and be willing to change the narrative I have written before White Women are the most potent weapon for the Patriarchal system Because if the system can keep White women deceived into thinking they should not have full autonomy over their own body mind place or that they need permission on any subtle level then Patriarchy wins White Women have a history of enabling the abuse of Patriarchy  Let s recognize this and do an about face Our militancy should be in alignment with the    Abolition Feminist Movement     begun by our Black Brown and Indigenous Sisters Right now the Woman in Congress standing up for and with women is AOC Some of you may be very confused by that if you re been a conservative most of your life but she has been bold enough to share her truth and the truth of     in  Women in the United States      and that s just what s reported and that we know of  The point I m making is we within ourselves need to take on this fight  for the sake of Healing and Justice in our country Remember   Amanda     Gorman     said what  just is isn t always  jus tice  let s change that shall we           More of my Expanded thoughts on White Women s role Hyperlinked Here    
Feminism,1612337409, I was never really told how hard pregnancy was It s often glamorized on social media  movies etc It s a beautiful thing to grow and birth a baby but it s not glamorous I was set up with unrealistic expectations At the beginning I was so sick I could hardly function I remember trying to be strong  force myself to get up every morning  go work   hours a week fearing people wouldn t take my sickness seriously or would see me as weak I remember even the father of my unborn baby would grow tired of me being sick or see me as a burden I lost weight every where and wasn t able to keep down food for about  months On top of that  the anxiety of everything you do effects your baby the hormone shifts loneliness and the worry I began to suffer from panic attacks and uncontrollable sobbing I was worried that I couldn t keep enough food down to allow my baby to get enough nutrients I was worried he could have the same potentially fatal birth defect I did I was worried about getting Covid finances during a pandemic  and so on As my pregnancy continued I eventually got over being so sick however random vomiting  amp nausea never ended The physical pain of growing bigger   sore breasts round ligament pain cramps and contractions The fatigue also never ended You never stop feeling drained I also struggled with finding clothes to wear I always loved fashion and took pride in what I would wear During pregnancy that goes out the window I struggled to find pants because I m tall and skinny Trying to find bras is a nightmare  no one makes a size   E that is reasonably priced My wardrobe consisted on leggings  sweats and baggy shirts  Dressing up could no longer be a reality  Eventually that takes a toll on your confidence It s hard to feel beautiful while in pain  getting bigger and not being able to wear anything you want  There s so much pressure on women to have a  beautiful pregnancy and to never complain But in reality it takes a toll on you physically mentally and emotionally Men call you crazy for being emotional friends think you are dramatic when you say you don t feel up to leaving the house etc it needs to be normalized that pregnancy is not glamorous It s hard work and draining You sacrifice everything about yourself to grow your baby Yes it is worth it and the unconditional love between you  amp baby is worth every second But it s important that pregnancy being miserable  painful  and hard is NORMALIZED

Feminism,1614102605,So for the past few months I have noticed a lot of men talking about the fact that they re puzzled at best and scared at worst when approaching women nowadays At first I thought that s not what the MeToo movement and women speaking up was about surely they must feel guilty about something to say this And then it hit me  it is precisely because a majority of men didn t know how ubiquitous and commonplace harassment is and that they started realising that themselves or their close ones have had misogynistic thoughts and or actions in the past and how deep all of these behaviours go that that discovery was so shocking and upsetting to them Now the problem is some of them are directly blaming women for speaking up because they weren t aware of this before in a classic case of shooting the messenger But if we think of fear and anger as signals that something is wrong and that we have to take these feelings into consideration and do something about the situation then perhaps it s a good thing that they feel that way because it shows that they too find it appalling And disheartening when they find that they have participated in this in one way or another I was brought to these thoughts while reading the book  Sorci res  or  Witches  by Swiss journalist and essayist Mona Chollet  pretty sure most European francophones on this sub know about her  It s a very interesting read and at the end of her book she talks about how mind and body were separated by  male thinkers of the   th century mostly opposing  male rationality and  female emotion  She said that since our way of thinking has not changed much since then we still see emotion as  irrational and to be avoided at all costs and what we think of as an  objective detached fact as the logical and preferred tool to approach our world But the thing is when we witness something horrifying and upsetting it is actually much more logical to be scared and angry than always trying to  take a step back  because some things are too serious and dangerous to only be taken as a  subject of interest to be studied at arm s length What do you think  
Feminism,1614078994,Good Morning Just needed to get a few things off my chest and I think this would probably be the best place to do it Anyway I was a big fan of metal rock music until about a week ago Then I found out what many bands did on tour It turns out that it is  standard operating proceedure for many bands to use the roadies to ask young people  often   year girls and the like backstage for sex generally under the guise of an aftershow party or just meeting the band I consider myself sex positive but my problem with this is that even if it s technically consensual it puts a fan in a position where they could easily be pressured into things they could not have wanted to do It shows someone s character and that they do not respect or have empathy for the fan s position be they male or female I think it s very likely a number of people agreed to sex in these conditions because they felt pressured to by the situation engineered by the band entourage which is not exactly consensual and the professionals in question were either willfully ignorant or straight up taking advantage of that power I still consider it morally reprehensible even if it was consensual using your position as a musician and your ontourage to sleep with generally young impressionable people who look up to you   There are parallels to be drawn behind such bands who use that power and the powerful men who were brought to justice via the metoo movement I ve been in two minds about this I wanted to defend my favs of course and did for few days in my mind  But I myself work in social care and if I saw this happening in front of my eyes I would be disturbed and I can no longer defend it I was also shocked when I saw people posting about it online defending it Like if say a fashion editor was picking out girls in the audience at a modeling show and getting an assistant to ask them backstage for sex I doubt those same people would agree with it Makes me wonder about parasocial relationships and the double standards we are all to quick to give people Look at David Bowie back in the   s he raped a   year old girl  Lori Mattox  She said she consented But morally and legally speaking no   year old can consent Even back in the   s this was considered reprehensible Yet he is not remembered as a child rapist in the way that the reputation of other famous dead artists  you know who I am talking about are or Ian Watkins is I ve been shaken to the core by this Sounds silly but even though I knew about Weinstein types it never really sunk in until I discovered artists I knew were doing this  I suffer from OCD which makes it worse as my mind tries to justify obessesive disturbing thoughts to make myself feel better Anyway thank you for listening to my rant I just wanted to put this out there so others could know I want to do a bit of good in the world To provide a warning to young girls at concerts EDIT Here s a link to an article talking about the experience of female roadies and how they are trying to tackle misconduct in the industry against  fans and staff  
Feminism,1614059272,When a man mentions going to the strip club I find it very off putting  I think it s because they are reinforcing the fact that straight men don t ever see women as actual humans but as beings to serve them in some regard I see them as the men who objectify women the most  However I am happy women have monetised from this and view SW in a positive light   So is it a backwards view I have on the men who go there yet respect the workers  Looking for your perspectives opinions and more  Looking to broaden my thought pattern  Thanks 
Feminism,1614057733,Over the last few years I ve noticed that my YouTube recommended videos have began to become more anti feminist and sexist in nature Like I tend to watch a lot of movie reviews and commentary videos and I began to see videos talking about how Brie Larson is evil and wants to destroy all men or other movies with strong female leads getting completely railed for wanting to have diversity And it s just been so exhausting Even when I try to find feminist videos that are positive and informative especially ones that aren t in the mainstream like Contrapoints Hbomberguy John Oliver or Philosophy Tube it s just a bunch of response videos that perform bad faith arguments against feminism What s worst is that they re popular and can get easily clicks without saying much in particular I m not saying people can t critique certain aspects of feminism like how being a terf can hurt transgender women and men but every video I see that try to argue against feminism it ends up being someone taking a few rare examples and generalizing the entire movement Or if a creator wants to talk about how men face sexism too they ll end up blaming it on feminism rather than the gender roles that are placed on men women and non binary by traditional values Then there are some videos where they ll agree that gender roles are a problem but will discredit feminism by saying that instead of saying women s right we need to just say rights or humanism rather than feminism It s honestly just sad that now saying you re a feminist is a contested issue Rather than being seen as a positive it s now being seen as a negative thing built on the back of straw man s bad faith arguments and misinformation

Feminism,1614303079,Hi all I m not sure how to begin this post  Please keep this discussion respectful and civil I m not exactly sure what to say because I ve never actually contemplated this question before until very recently so please me if I don t articulate my thoughts clearly This thread was created with the intention to welcome anyone to discuss this topic  respectfully and civilly  for me to explore my own stance on this matter  as I ve never challenged it before  and to hopefully get a bit more education from all opinions regarding this topic  If you decide to state facts to support your opinions please provide links to sources that can back you up thanks  Below are some of my thoughts already going into this I m not sure if they ll be beneficial or worthwhile for this discussion but decided to add them in case they were I ve always morally supported sex workers I ve been watching porn since I was young I do believe there is a lot of exploitation and abuse in the porn and sex work industry I also believe there are safe ways for sex workers to make a living or hold a job in that field  even if it may still be considerably riskier than a  normal job  I have loved getting to know myself through watching porn I have found some empowerment through exploring myself via porn I also believe I ve harmed myself in conscious and unconscious ways by consistently viewing porn I believe porn can be both helpful and harmful for society and individuals I am very liberal leaning I am a feminist Lately I ve been seeing a lot of posts on various social media that encourage the support of sex workers education of their industry and protecting people in that field I ve also been seeing posts that condemn the consumption of porn Seeing the mix of these types of posts in my feeds confused me The majority if not all people I follow online have the same views as I do politically and socially and all my friends morally support people in adult entertainment and also watch porn So I guess I was confused to see the condemnation of porn from what I thought were like minded individuals  and I ve never met someone who supported sex workers but disagreed with porn  It got me thinking about what is right and wrong and what I believe So feel free to leave your own thoughts below on the matter Below are a couple questions I ve been wondering to myself and would love to see other people answer  TL DR Is watching porn morally bad even if you re watching someone s who is producing content in a safe and healthy way  Can you support sex workers the adult entertainment industry if you condemn porn If so how  Reminder to keep discussion as respectful and civil as possible If you mention facts in your discussion please try to add a link to your sources 
Feminism,1614280902,I m just wondering how other feminists view male violence and possible causes to that I ve noticed recently that when talking about this topic many women believe it s because of an inherent drive to dominate and have power over others in a way that women don t A woman close to me said that men  biologically want to make others feel bad to feel better about themselves Where I live these sorts of beliefs are somewhat normal and although I agree to a certain degree I feel like it s a bit harsh and derogatory to say stuff like that So I wonder what do you view as possible causes to the overwhelming amount of male violence over female Do you think it s purely biological induced by society or both

Feminism,1614276684,So I know engaging with TERFs isn t exactly helpful but a point I see them bring up is that trans women are a  hideous parody of womanhood  Usually by engaging in an  overperformance of femininity and while I know I won t be able to convince any died in the wool bigots maybe an average person will see this and it ll help them understand See when you re trans you don t exist in a world where it is considered  positive for you to behave in a hyper feminine manner Because by and large being raised in a boys world allows significantly less room for gender variance than growing up as a woman In a lot of way it s one of the great failings of second wave feminism As the ability for men to express themselves in non traditionally masculine ways is not incredibly different from that of the     s People assigned male at birth are still beaten to death for wearing dresses and make up That generally speaking does not happen for women wearing pants As a result your acceptance into broader society as a trans woman is directly tied to your ability to be authentically seen as a woman by your peers And if you don t  pass well enough to be seen as such you better put in the extra effort The punishment for failing to meet these expectations can be extreme Being socially ostracized and feeling unsafe are just the beginning Losing your job losing access to medal care  not just transition related  and violence both physical and sexual are all distinct possibilities So you perform femininity like your life depends on it because it does So the next time you see a  hideous parody of womanhood  Just know that the scorn you may feel is why she is the way she is

Feminism,1614926019,Does anyone else feel the same way as me Let me explain where I am coming from  TW I do bring up Rape Abuse Virginity and Purity Culture This is a topic that relates pretty strictly to heterosexual cisgender couples so please bear with me Something that has bothered me for some time is the stereotype of fathers threatening their daughter s boyfriends before dates It is often portrayed in movies and television and it is something that I think is still very pervasive in U S society  as well as other societies of course  particularly in conservative and or religious homes I recently had a discussion with my  mostly feminist mom and she just could not see where I was coming from Here is my argument this  protecting of daughters by fathers is super problematic on many levels but the main one is that I think it takes away from the identity of the daughter as her own person She is only someone because of her father and what his protection awards her It is in the same vein as when a woman is attacked for speaking out about rape or sexual harassment and people will say  what if she was your mother daughter sister  It effectively takes away that woman s identity and awards it to the men around her  father brother etc  Each woman is her own person and she should not only be given an identity when it relates to a man in her life Edit I wanted to add one more point  that I believe that the fathers protecting daughters is problematic in that it creates this toxic cycle of men only respecting men boyfriends respect their girlfriends only when they have a father  or brother behind them What happens to the girls who don t have fathers brothers Should they be treated differently because a man isn t threatening to beat up their boyfriends The second reason I find it problematic is because no father  or mother ever says to a girl to be kind to their son that they better not  hurt their son Lots of men have experienced heartbreak from a girl they have dated but this is a non issue To me this is mostly due to purity culture because essentially what father s are really saying when they say  you better not hurt my daughter or else    is you better not have sex with her because virginity is still seen as a virtue and without it a woman is effectively devalued When I spoke with my mom about this she said that fathers doing this is a way of loving and protecting women that because we are the  fairer sex we will always be weaker than men and that is what fathers are worried about But I would argue it is not the safety of their daughters it is once again the virginity that they are worried about No father says don t you even think about killing my daughter hitting my daughter raping my daughter etc I would argue that those horrific things are not even implied  it is solely about virginity and that is why no one cares about their sons being  hurt because virginity and purity are solely in the hands and responsibility of women I would love the input of others and I thought this sub would be a good place to start Does anyone else agree with me or see where I am coming from Or am I way off base 
Feminism,1614923635,So as you probably read I m a lesbian and I just really needed to vent about something here  Obviously there are a lot of misogynistic traditions when it comes to marriage  the bride being  given away  and taking the husband s last name and especially in the past it would just trap women and they would be there husbands and that should be addressed because it s important but sometimes I ll get a bad vibe when that s all feminists  especially straight ones talk about when it comes to marriage Because I ve seen plenty of times where they will just go on and on and on about how marriage is solely benefiting a man without acknowledging the fact that not all women marry men It just feels like they re excluding a major struggle some women have had to face and to me it feels like they re just reinforcing the idea that every marriage is between a man and a woman And not to say marriage is for everyone or you should believe in it But I want to get married and sometimes when I say that to a straight woman and hear that it s just reinforcing patriarchal society it makes me feel icky because I don t plan on marrying a man And I don t think this is necessarily their intentions but it just makes me feel weird  when that s all they say not talking about it in general  Sappics already get excluded so much especially lesbians because we don t pursue men Basically I just wish that if you are straight and addressing the topic to just acknowledge that not all marriages will have a man woman dynamic Sorry I m not really the best with words and I m typing this on my phone but I hope this makes sense and I can t speak for all gay woman but this is just my feelings 
Feminism,1614896116,I am a feminist because of the time I wanted to wear a dress and my mom told me not to because I ll get raped I am a feminist because I can t walk alone at night without being afraid something bad could happen I am a feminist because of my dad who constantly tells me and not my brother to go cook and clean because that s what I m supposed to do I am a feminist because my hole life I ve been taught that guys teasing on girls and being straight up rude and mean was romantic cute and something I should like and feel good about I am a feminist because of all the people who think that having  no as an answer is only for playing hard to get I am a feminist for the equality between men women and all the people who are just in between I am a feminist and I support all women regardless of their attraction skin color assigned gender at birth body type or career job because we re all amazing and beautiful And as a feminist I also support men for being who they are and having emotions without having to be  tough or  strong  and for crying just like any other human being So yes I m a feminist 
Feminism,1614895749,Arguments for and against this mentality I personally fall into certain communities that say things like this a lot but it also sort of implies woman are unable to make any choices without male input  This is a hot topic for why women do SW etc  In particular being in anti porn communities these sorts of statements seem to come off a little weird to me  and they come up often    P S This view is not necessarily my own I m just scared I m reading into swerfy misogynist reddit potentially and would obviously like to not be a part of that 
Feminism,1614882601,Hey feminists of the internet this is just a rant about my dermatology appointment today I was really excited about it but it was one of the worst hospital visits I think I ve ever had When I went into the room a male doctor  still in med school looked at me before my actual doctor He was extremely nice and asked before he touched my face back stomach legs etc and talked to me about what products I was using and all of that stuff When my actual doctor came in she looked at me for maybe  minutes and then decided that we needed to get the accutane process started and that I needed to start birth control and these other  medications along with this topical medicine Additionally when she looked at me she pretty much touched me where ever and pulled down shirt so that she could see if I had boob acne without asking which caught me completely off guard and the male doctor was in the room and I m a minor When she started talking about how I need to be on birth control so that if I get pregnant on accutane my babies won t be deformed I freaked out  as one would  I had just fought my way out of all of these stupid medications that made me feel like crap and she wanted to put me on more   So she asked me if I had any questions and I started crying because I was so overwhelmed She then asked why I was crying and I told her that I didn t want to be on birth control She asked me why and I responded with  because I don t want it to make me more emotional I would have said more but I was having trouble breathing because I was crying so much She then told me that it wouldn t make me more emotional and then asked my mom if she had any questions and then left The male doctor was still in the room and talked to me about how I could just start with the topical medication and that birth control doesn t work for everyone The woman doctor came back with this contract for accutane that I had to sign about how I couldn t have sex for  months I signed it but made sure that It didn t lock me into taking any medication I m just so fed up with doctors 
Feminism,1615432680,I feel like most women these days are over sexualizing themselfes and then complain about being objectified 
Feminism,1615432665,I don t know if it s feminism exactly but you re right  I think the cultural divide between men and women in the US is different to the UK American men as the traditional target TV market in control of the remote are offered material they can relate to and aspire to like the  ordinary guy who is actually a cool guy in disguise and the  funny cool guy as well as the more aspirational  obviously hot cool guy  US women have traditionally been a market for TV advertising who are just expected to buy what they see and so they were offered aspirational tokenism fit for the male gaze primarily Men didn t want to see regular women on TV and women wouldn t buy their Nordstrom dresses  I think it s worth noting that the BBC revenue doesn t come completely from advertising I m pretty sure all most of TV station revenue in the US comes from advertising  and free to air television over there is fairly competitive 
Feminism,1615432330,cool and props for you to calling that  but what does having a need to dominate sexually has to be equal to rape the key word missing in a sexual act and rape is consent and that s the bedrock if two people consent what type of activity and with what dynamic they engage in it doesn t matter  i mean we might agree on this that beating a random person out of the blue just to test your street fighting skills is the definition of arsehole behavior but when you wrestle with your siblings for fun it s not arsehole behavior both are acts of physical agression but labelling both as  toxic masculinity and  boys will be boys is like comparing a tea leaf with a cup of English tea 
Feminism,1615431757,Entirely     in agreement This is an issue that really bothers me about American  and thus Canadian TV Men can be anything from stunning to meh but women are ALWAYS stunning In Canada we do a tiny bit better job with our  serious business programs   but yea It all sucks and I don t know what to tell you other than it s DEFINITELY not your imagination 
Feminism,1615431559,Same I m American and I have noticed this phenomenon for   years Good call y all 
Feminism,1615431447,wait you won t protect your loved ones and would instead argue and debate with someone who just slapped your mother sister out of the blue what s toxic in protecting your loved ones and teaching others not to screw over your loved ones  if you don t teach them a lesson they ll go on and be more and more open to attack others because they were never stopped 
Feminism,1615430383,it s not public opinion in the democratic sense where the majority of people have the opinion and so action is taken What happens is small minorities of people on twitter are being very loud which is then making employers cancel their employees 
Feminism,1615429563, Politics isn t like marriage you aren t waiting for the one Politics is a bus service if none are going to your desired destination you catch the one going closest to going where you need to be 
Feminism,1615429184,I m only defensive of him in that he s not as bad as Trump He s not a saint I believe victims 
Feminism,1615429079,Canadian here  I prefer European television and films for a number of reasons but the main one is that I find the actors reflect actual people and not some unrealistic unattainable ideal 
Feminism,1615428009,I agree This is something I ve noticed for a long time 
Feminism,1615427729,I first believed her more but I read that she had lied in a court because of that her lawyer dropped her So not as much anymore Joe Biden was creepy though but he seems to be behaving a lot better lately Cuomo is the bigger fish nowadays 
Feminism,1615427427,I am not from the USA and I do not now the details of all the allegations I think the democratic party went with the option of a not ideal white establishment guy because that is seen as and quite possibly sadly is the  safer option for getting more votes than anyone of colour any woman or anyone not from the mainstream political clique 
Feminism,1615427190, gt a guy slapped my sister and safe to say i got a bloodied face and he had to get his nose reconstructed a fine example of how toxic masculinity and patriarchy manifest irl yet according to you it doesn t exist  
Feminism,1615425522,Awesome  Won t be surprised if she ends up setting a new record of crossings  She s getting close 
Feminism,1615424365,Because  subjectively speaking I think human life particularly my human life is very valuable But that is just my subjective opinion it s not an objective truth like laws of physics And thank you for using my favorite word that no one else ever knows Have you read Metamorphosis 
Feminism,1615423868,I m absolutely terrified In my opinion we should assume Roe will be overturned and start planning now for how to guarantee federal abortion rights post Roe 
Feminism,1615421966,I ain t even think about it like that Just  people can change it for good Like what the hell
Feminism,1615420786, Masculinity doesn t only have negative traits It has lots of positive ones Toxic masculinity is meant to only refer to the negative ones Negative male gender roles might be a better word choice 
Feminism,1615420084,That is what then is the meaning of feminism Do you behave correctly and everything will be fine Nobody argues with this Don t tell others how to behave and admit that a girl can be masculine and a boy can be feminine Nobody argues with this Do people like to generalize Yes But this is a property of thinking We cannot get rid of it completely When you are a neural network forced to make decisions in situations where there is not enough information to make decisions this is simply inevitable At the level of thinking 
Feminism,1615418057, gt It is not true to say that  masculinity only has negative traits Toxic masculinity does not mean or imply that masculinity   only  has toxic traits The fact that you have to differentiate it from masculinity in general is the clue 
Feminism,1615417846,We can t vote the Supreme Court out And with Amy Coney Barrett we may now be fucked 
Feminism,1615417642,Aren t these same characteristics leading to male dominance in power and gender wage gaps It is not true to say that  masculinity only has negative traits 
Feminism,1615416647,Because white people and men already have the majority of the power It s really quite simple  Girl power Black power etc imply  yes let s have a share which we are currently not able to access   White power and  Male power imply  let s keep the majority of power which we already have  
Feminism,1615415663,Buy  why are men more likely to employ the methods they do compared to women  Why are their resulting rates of suicide higher Perhaps due to the lack of support and counseling they receive men are more likely to attempt suicide while in a deeper depressive state and thus are  sure of their decision In contrast perhaps women are more likely to still feel conflicted about their decision to commit suicide and therefore employ less instantaneous methods Men are also more likely to self medicate via substance abuse which may have an effect on how and when they commit suicide That choice to self medicate could again be attributed to a feeling that they must deal with the problem themselves rather than seek help You cannot simply say that there cannot be any relationship between suicide and social stigma surrounding mental health support simply because they don t attempt suicide more often than women In fact there is  plenty of data to show that they seek help less often and that this is correlated with holding more traditional views of masculinity  
Feminism,1615415586,Being male or being white already implies having more power because we are in a racist and patriarchal system  Claiming that a white person has more power for being white is to increase that difference in power and it is racist the same with men  On the other hand to claim that women or Afro descendants have more power is to reduce this inequality of power because it is to grant more power to those who are currently oppressed and expelled from the spaces of power 
Feminism,1615415502,Is this the    s  Are people still saying  girl power anymore   But anyway to answer your question   how many girls or even women have been popes bishops presidents prime ministers imperial powers warlords  hmm even that term seems to give the answer  or in any significant way had the power and force of the state to impose their will on others  Seems kind of obvious to me how that is different from  white power  
Feminism,1615414950,I think you re focusing too much on what you re calling basically  arsehole behaviour  An important thing to understand about toxic masculinity is that it s less about behaviour and more about the societal expectations that compel that behaviour the kind of thing you re looking at  is one example in which say a man is expected to respond to an insult with violence  or at least the threat of violence  or else he is weak and unmanly  But toxic masculinity manifests in other ways Just a couple of days ago a friend of mine ended up alone in the drink next to his upside down boat in an inlet in the damned Pacific with no lifejacket no radio and bad chances It was sheer dumb luck that another boat just happened to go past him and hear him yelling for help and plucked him  and his dog out of the water He d been in the water quite a while by that point and likely wouldn t have lasted much longer But just try suggesting to this guy  I love him but he makes bad choices sometimes that perhaps he should have a life vest when he s on the water and carry a handheld radio on his person or maybe attach his damn killswitch cord when he s running   good luck Because he s apparently more afraid of looking scared or not brave or not tough and specifically  not manly  than he is of death itself This is the kind of toxic masculinity that gets a lot of men killed  and nearly killed him on Monday Another example is men not reporting sexual assaults against them because they re worried that by asserting that they didn t enjoy it they re somehow not  real men  Or men not reporting domestic violence because allowing oneself to be abused by a woman makes one a weakling So we re not just talking about  arsehole behaviour here We re talking about a whole societal notion of what a  real man ought to be  a notion that can be held by men and women both  and examining just how destructive and at times lethal it can be 
Feminism,1615413605,I really dislike the term  toxic masculinity  mostly because I hate the term  toxic   but I think you re overlooking what the term is trying to get at a little bit Feelings of aggression are not intrinsically wrong In fact very few feelings or even impulses are wrong in and of themselves What s  wrong is the actions you take because of them It s not wrong to be angry but when angry is the only emotion deemed legitimate to express and only in specific ways that is very much a problem Your experiences with expressing your emotions or your friends experiences may be different and that s great I ve noticed a lot of younger men who feel comfortable expressing a wide range of emotions Personally as a queer person I ve mostly lived in progressive communities and while I ve had a couple run ins with homophobia I really haven t experienced all that much and don t usually even think about it when I m out with friends or partners But that does not mean that my experience is the same as other queer people Similarly where gender socialization is concerned there s research out there that paints a different picture of male socialization one which may not affect your generation but certainly affects many men in their late   s and   s If you have access to a library database you can search for this research yourself A quick search of my own brought up the following research  Confirming Gender Stereotypes A Social Role Perspective        which found that when men were put in high stakes and emotionally vulnerable situations they were significantly more likely to conform to gender stereotypes   Silence and  in visibility in men s accounts of coping with stressful life events        which looks at strategies men use to mask stress and anxiety and  Individual Differences in Masculine Gender Socialization as Predictive of Men s Psychophysiological Responses to Negative Affect        There s a lot of literature out there which is worth exploring  gt a woman can do a lot when she s all powerful Patriarchy is a  structure  not an individual Women can also reinforce patriarchy   and in the case of powerful women they often must do so to get where they are 
Feminism,1615413517,Aw Good for her though but I ll miss the sass fly on oh prescient feminist waterfowl 
Feminism,1615413416,Technically don t all actors always have makeup on in movies  All jokes aside you re right For the most part  There are exceptions The Walking Dead for example    thank goodness the producers were sensible enough to save most of the makeup for the zombies  Ok Clearly it s time for a nap Then perhaps we could all be inspired to write a more realistic screenplay 
Feminism,1615412168,What happened to u oracular duck If you don t mind me asking 
Feminism,1615410522,You were given an example of toxic masculinity being that men and boys are told to  man up and not given the emotional tools or support to deal with distress Statistically men are far more likely to have successful suicide attempts Men deserve to have the same level of support in times of crisis as women 
Feminism,1615410288,I ve watched the show some time ago so I have a fading impression The rape scene in the first episode The show touched the topic to show off it s gritty atmosphere which it lost right after While I think art can touch every topic this was done disrespectfully and only for shock value The female characters in the scene were drawn in a way where it seemed to fetishize the act The male characters simply got killed Regarding the fan service I remember it having the red haired farm lady with her breasts taking up half of the screen and defying laws of gravity 
Feminism,1615410252,I think that lots of man view the term  toxic  masculinity as an attack but they don t fully understand it It may not be the absolute best terminology but it is true  It is true that men have much worst outcomes when in it comes to suicide medical outcomes and can often suffer from mental health because they don t seek support Toxic masculinity refers to social standard where men must be stoic not show emotion and not seek out help Think of it more as gendered standards that are enforced on men and ultimately have negative outcomes When people say  remove gender from society they are generally referring to the erosion of gender roles For example men can do jobs traditionally held by women I would agree with you that there have been female world leaders that have done terrible things I think the fact that the vast majority the worlds leaders are men is the issue 
Feminism,1615409998,Exhausting yes but by r askfeminists standards I wouldn t call him a troll  Granted that s a low bar 
Feminism,1615409864,Even America had restrictions on male voting rights  So again feminists have spun a dishonest reading of history
Feminism,1615409799,Just because you personally haven t experienced it doesn t mean it doesn t happen but your experiences aren t the norm   gt men who rape are egotistical arseholes who feel that they can loose masculinity if they don t control the surroundings   But they re still men who are convinced that dominating women sexually is necessary to be masculinity That s what toxic masculinity is We know that but a lot of men don t that s why we talk about it 
Feminism,1615409512,agreed and it was especially bad around   s with all the govinda stuff raging I still don t think that it s upon the movies to teach kids the meaning of consent it s upon the parents and schools and that has been happening now also a bigger hindernce in putting it all together is the uneven nature of laws in India the laws around rape especially after nirbhaya episode tilted in favor of women  and a man still is mocked if he presses a rape charge against a woman  see honestly what you re describing is bad parenting it s upon parents and schools to impart that knowledge to teach the difference between good and bad touch and to teach the concept of consent but to address your point further if a woman rapes a man   i won t automatically say that she did so because of femininity or that it s toxic  that s where my gripe lies because suggestions like toxic masculinity gives off a vibe that it s somehow ok or masculine to rape which it absolutely isn t  also i hope you broke every fuckin bone in the body of that  year old bastard A similar incident happened with me where a guy slapped my sister and safe to say i got a bloodied face and he had to get his nose reconstructed 
Feminism,1615408776,Regarding your last sentence they know and they don t care If a woman dies from lack of access in any way they will blame her in some way shape or form The politicians who propose and vote for these measures have money and connections to get abortions for their family and mistresses if needed plus the pull to silence those who perform them They re about as  pro life as a land mine but no matter they ll be cheered on by idiots   Arkansas has a lot of abstinence only  sex ed and the highest teen pregnancy rate so as we can see their methods don t work Again no matter the results don t mean shit as long as you can pretend to be  pro life  even as the bodies pile up 
Feminism,1615408675,I m from India and the culture does not teach people the concept of consent As you ve probably seen Indian movies and culture in general normalizes stalking street harassment and sexual assault A  year old touched my little sister inappropriately when she was  years old This and other experiences people have shared with me tells me that sexual assault is not some isolated behavior of some arseholes It is a systemic cultural problem that women s rights are not valued No one is actively teaching boys to rape but many of them grow up without understanding what consent is because sexual assault is so commonplace 
Feminism,1615408302,and i respectfully diagree with that position I don t know where exactly is this thing of  emotions makes you less of a man going on I ve never seen this displayed once in person and the only time i ve heard  men don t cry was when i was crying in a friend s arms and he told me that in the most calm and caring way there was no force to stop me from crying only a suggestion that sounded more like  it s ok things will be fine  other than that i ve never once witnessed this idea that emotions make a man less manly in real life the idea is only visible in movies and even then it sounds like a projection to show the  Hero image  I agree and that s why i feel it s a stupid thing to suggest men who rape are egotistical arseholes who feel that they can loose masculinity if they don t control the surroundings i mean when has fear of lack of control a sign of masculinity I d go as far as to say always being uncomfortable in your surroundings and trying to make things the way you are otherwise it s a threat is probably anti masculine it s a type of behavior psychotic arseholes engage in 
Feminism,1615407391,or it can simply be that men are more effective at suicide like i stated more women attempt suicide but the methods women employee are weak if i am to accept your position then it should be inferenced that more men  attempt suicide when in reality they don t  men use methods like guns to kill themselves which is instantaneous death women use methods like pills that give them a window where they can be saved it s simply the effectiveness of method that s employed  to accept your position data must show that more men are attempting suicide    which simply isn t the case   
Feminism,1615407124,No this guy is a troll We don t want him in r menslib 
Feminism,1615406945,Regarding suicide stats show that men seek mental health support at significantly lower rates than women This is typically considered to be a result of the perceived stigma associated with men admitting acknowledging that they are struggling with problems like depression 
Feminism,1615406597,Oh definitely I guess my point was more  that if I m in a shop I don t mind people talking to me  if it s spontaneous about something random and not about hooking up dating To be honest I quite like those small interactions and have met a few good friends in very random situations 
Feminism,1615406517,  what about it it only shows that more men commit suicide than women  I mean i ve seen this thrown around so many times by both sides Look at the suicide rate   what does tell exactly women try to attempt more but men die more because of suicide as they employ effective measures the group with highest rates of suicide in     is still men aged       since you mentioned suicide here s another interesting stat the     figures suggest that life expectancy of men in UK is     years while it s     years for females on an average a female lives longer than a man       text Figure       Life   expectancy   at   birth amp text By          life   expectancy   in      see   Figure      How does that prove there s patriarchy in UK if anything it proves that women have it better than men and live longer in UK 
Feminism,1615406110,I just want to state that what I m about to say isn t an accusatory statement whatsoever I have a great piece of advice about her content if you identify as a feminist You know all the parts of Roma Army s content that you look at and deem as anti women misogynistic This is the same way many men feel about many feminists due to the ones that approach feminism in the way she approaches men s rights  and there are many women that do some going far enough to proudly declare themselves misandrists  Not saying all women who are feminists do but there are many out there that do The way a group is viewed is as an average of all the views of the people who declare themselves a part of said group Each time a man comes into contact with a misandrist who declares themselves a feminist it hurts the collect view and good faith of all the other feminists out there That s why it s so important to speak up about the negatives you see within the groups you associate with This isn t meant to be an attack on feminists this goes for men s rights activists as well or really any group We tend to immediately defend a cause from our point of view not realizing there are people out there identifying in the same groups as us but not acting right This is something we all know instinctively but I think we get so attached to our group identities we get in the us vs them mentality where we can t accept even earnest genuine criticism 
Feminism,1615406052,Yeah watch it again through a feminist lense It s pretty bad Even the way they manage and justify their career moves are through this gendered angle that isn t ever addressed or called out The whole series had a LOT of problems in hindsight It s an interesting time capsule 
Feminism,1615405946,I understand that But no couple can realistically be the  happily ever after Disney couple right It always seemed to me that the appeal of the portrayal on Marshall and Lily s relationship came from the fact that they were a realistic couple that yes loved each other deeply but would also act selfishly and hurt each other from time to time but always would end up talking through it They would held grudges for past actions but still try to overcome them But that might be an idealized version of them I have in my mind 
Feminism,1615405943,Perhaps you should look up the disparity between suicide rates of men and women in the UK There s your objective evidence
Feminism,1615404815, gt Victoria notably had to agree to never marry or else forfeit her crown  she wasn t the  virgin queen by choice or for fun  Victoria was married Elizabeth I was the  virgin queen   Is that who you re talking about 
Feminism,1615404812,I mean I think there are certain ways that social interactions absolutely do work to preserve inequality  I think that learning to  look out for these things can end up turning on you and becoming a new form of hyper vigilance for women and other marginalized people  So rather than pointing to specific things that are  red flags that someone isn t a feminist  I think it s safe to just talk about feelings If you are feminist and in conversation feel safe about honestly expressing that  then likely you are in a safe relationship with someone who isn t going to go out of their way to harm you on the basis of your identity or gender  If someone says things or behaves in a way that makes you feel unsafe or uncomfortable  you can try to approach that person and have a conversation about it and hopefully clear up a misunderstanding or some thoughtlessness on their part or if what they said or did is a boundary violation for you disengage and do your best to avoid that person in the future as you would anyone else who seemed to be making you feeling uncomfortable or unsafe on purpose The thing that s hardest is that you cannot always avoid or disengage and unsafe person or situation or sometimes because the situation is so unsafe  you can t even reflect fully on whats going on and might only feel that way in retrospect  that s okay You won t have the energy or capacity to respond to every moment what matters is your ability to eventually get to safety and to heal from difficult experiences  gt Which isn t entirely possible in loud settings or when someone is bombarding another persons mental state all the time If someone is   bombarding  another person in any way for any reason  all the time    that is the red flag That is that person demonstrating that they don t notice or care about the boundaries of others A person like that is typically not a safe person to discuss sensitive issues with 
Feminism,1615404746,Just  so many times they both treat each other like garbage    That with the backdrop and overtones of  all the other problematic   pieces and it was just    toxic Not a perfect couple   at all 
Feminism,1615404474,So   in the past   years they have finally gotten female prime ministers  I don t know how that shows that England is by no means patriarchal 
Feminism,1615404236,Hi I m not going to post this because we try not to have too many meta posts but I m really glad this community is helpful to you  feel free to continue hanging out here It s nice to get some positive feedback 
Feminism,1615403645,i agree that s why i said ceremonial monarch and added the point of Thatcher and May 
Feminism,1615403570,But    let s  not catastrophise Keep  the vibes    positive    my dude  
Feminism,1615403393,Eh Victoria was not particularly politically educated and her first Prime Minister Melbourne was a considerable mentor to her and exerted a lot of influence  And yes there were something like twenty prime ministers during her reign  Prime ministers absolutely were a thing   Elizabeth II has never had any political power merely ceremonial  In regards to England   the Anglican Church didn t ordain women until      and women could not be consecrated as bishops until       Married women weren t allowed to hold property until       Women couldn t vote until      limited suffrage for women over   who owned property began in        Peerage laws still are male primogeniture not absolute primogeniture   with the exception of the monarch peerage titles and lands still go to the eldest son  Land and title passing from father to son and excluding daughters is kind of the most old school definition of patriarchy 
Feminism,1615403264,No i actually looked up for terms like  when did UK became a democracy and it gave a bbc article about the peoples act of       that s how i assumed it was a monarchy before that cause the Viceroys here in India were subjects to the Queen after UK took over in      i do admit that i made a judgement of error there though  i ll check out the menslib sub thanks i just hope they aren t radical because it triggers bad memories thanks again 
Feminism,1615402845,I mean you could read about Queen Victoria and the history of parliament and the prime minister on Wikipedia  It seems like you didn t even take  minutes to do research before posting baseless claims here and asking people to take the time to refute you  My advice to you in general if you re actually interested in learning about gender issues is to take responsibility for your own education  Find some articles books podcasts youtube channels whatever  If you make a polite request in a new post here or in r menslib I m sure you d get some good recommendations I m serious about checking out menslib those guys are pretty cool 
Feminism,1615402774,well thank i ll look into it a little deeply now  but honestly i still don t find it quite convincing that it was all due to patriarchy and that in case of Victoria there was absolutely no sway or control over her subjects her prime ministers were powerful sure but she still had a lot of sway over them  also i d like to add that i wrote for Elizabeth  the current queen and not the first one and that s why i said a ceremonial monarch because of the whole constitutional monarchy thing in her reign it has happened twice that the two most powerful positions in UK were both with women   first in the case of Thatcher and recently under Theresa may  bur yes i ll look more intothings you suggested thanks
Feminism,1615402442,Nope Victoria was not an absolute monarch at all  And Prime Ministers were very very much a thing during her reign  Walpole was the first PM and I think that was the      s 
Feminism,1615402130,Even if we had legislators with a spine there s nothing they could do bar pass a bill that d be blocked by a federal judge within an hour  Republicans covered their bases with this a long time ago In the   s they pushed for an expansion of the lower courts to ensure the SCOTUS never got overburdened which as it was a     moderate conservative majority at the time they intended to destroy the prior precedent for packing so that it could reign unchallenged and unchanged for decades Reagan then started the idea of swapping out the moderate conservative majority on that court with radicals that could serve a solid far right wing agenda but was blocked with people like Bork because the Dems had the senate Things then deradicalized for a few decades but now the GOP is back to those same principles and ideas and thanks to the lower court expansion   years ago have wiped out the previous precedent for court packing So the only way to stop them now is not to give them anymore seats  Breyer and then win the next few elections so that we can replace Thomas and Alito 
Feminism,1615402114,i did say i find some of it India but honestly i found none in London 
Feminism,1615402032,afaik Victoria was an absolute monarch and the concept of Constitution and prime ministers came much later  as for constraints i think those hold true irrespective of the gender of monarch   isn t it i mean it s a bit difficult to digest that a man as a king would hold more freedom and control over his subjects than say a woman as queen  i mean truth be told i originally intended this post for men only and that s why i posted it on askmen i have had a few bad experiences with some radicals feminists in past and i am basically someone who s in once bitten twice shy situation when it comes to someone who say they re a feminist A user told me to post it here otherwise he thought i am just circlejerking for karma which i never really understood If i wanted karma i d post a cat gif on r aww   anyways thanks a lot

Feminism,1615401870,If you can t see toxic masculinity at all in India or the UK you are deliberately avoiding looking 
Feminism,1615401828, gt Victoria was a monarch and controlled UK for a good  decades as a dictator even under Elizabeth the UK is a constitutional monarchy with the ceremonial head as a woman how exactly is UK a patriarchy when for the majority of last two centuries it was under Women first literally and then figuratively  Well if you know much about English history I don t know how you can point to Elizabeth as anything other than an example of how the country was very much a patriarchy then  Her father divorced his wife of over two decades broke with the Catholic church and beheaded a woman all to get a son  beheaded another woman for infidelity too and divorced another under the guise that she wasn t attractive enough though his own impotence was probably more of an issue there   That Elizabeth was the  Virgin Queen and never married was precisely because of patriarchy  Any man she married would have been King of England and the English absolutely did not want a foreign king and there was too much court in fighting for anyone to accept a fellow lord as King  Plus there was all the drama with the Protestant leaders especially those in Scotland having a big issue with Queens ruling especially if that made them head of the church as well  Was quite the issue for Elizabeth and her cousin Mary Queen of Scots  Just because due to her brother s sickliness and dying young her father s illegitimate sons all dying young and her older sister s death Elizabeth managed to get on the throne doesn t mean the entire system wasn t quite patriarchal   By Victoria s reign the monarchy s power was by no means absolute and the Prime Ministers during her reign  all of whom were men had quite a bit of power themselves  Worth noting too that at the time Victoria came to the throne married women were not allowed to hold property in their own name among a great number of restrictions of rights  That every so often due to deaths and lack of male heirs a woman gets on the throne really doesn t prove England was not a patriarchy especially if you look at the history of primogeniture and entail  I mean it s been in the   st century when they finally changed the rule so that the first born child of the monarch regardless of gender would inherit  Before that it was always the firstborn son 
Feminism,1615401727,It s not always the case of being able to afford a stay at home parent  It many cases it s not being able to actually afford to work due to the cost of child care   This was the case for me and my wife  My wife working was a luxury we couldn t afford and it stunted my wife s career and will forever effect her due to having an insufficient    k This isn t meant to be confrontational it s just I thought it needed corrected that SAHM D is not always due to being able to afford a SAHP 
Feminism,1615401519,no i am taking your words   i am only trying to extend a conversation to understand the viewpoint better Mine aren t arguments they re more of a dialogue 
Feminism,1615401434,agreed but then i just don t see any evidence for such toxic masculinity happening around for most part neither in India and especially not it UK without giving out much details i went through normal schools and universities  had a healthy mix of men and women in my circle and i never really saw men not opening up  i mean sure  women were more expressive at times but men too in different situations the only time i can think of this expression of  toxic masculinity was during the infamous Delhi rape case when the interview of the rapist came out we weren t like   he is a male and hence he s toxic and scum    it was simply agreed that he was an arsehole and had it been a woman in his place the same thing would be said  that s what i meant when i said that the term toxic masculinity seems like a projection and i feel really put off when someone suggest  teach your boys not to rape  i mean come on are parents really teaching their boys that it s ok to rape or is it just arsehole behavior that s projected on men I am yet to meet men who believe that despicable behavior like rape can be justified in any form

Feminism,1615401190,My first suggestion is to repost this in r menslib  You re likely to get more mens perspectives which I think you might find helpful Re question   your interpretation of queens in the UK being dictators is more than a little absurd  I think you can answer this question yourself if you think about who are the people around the monarch  Who are the prime ministers political advisors the owners of land and capitol  How are nobility and monarchs  especially women constrained by the expectations of society and of the people who uphold and benefit from the monarchy 
Feminism,1615400977,I don t really feel like arguing with you about it Take me at my word or don t 
Feminism,1615400867,That doesn t have anything to do with what I ve said 
Feminism,1615400835,but extremes are and correct me if i am wrong   manifest only in certain situations and that s when it becomes arshole behavior innit sure at extremes aggression can be really harmful if it s used as method only to abuse someone   but that doesn t invalidate the whole feeling of agression as bad or toxic  no i respectfully disagree I mean i ve been around men s  groups throughout my life but i never once heard these expressions like  men don t cry taught as solid lines on stone for most part they were said with compassion and  a way to suggest  it s fine  honestly i ve seen all my close friends cry in front of me  ask for help when they needed and i did the same a few times the only difference i noticed was that the need was communicated non verbally and we kinda understood when interventions were needed  aren t we already doing that i mean some of the top most chefs in the world are men some of the sharpest CEO s and politicians in the world are women I admit it might be a little evident in India but in UK   i saw none of those constraints at least not in my workplace and industry  but a woman can do a lot when she s all powerful she can induce structures where more representation of woman is visible she can create laws and ordeals that might affect conditions of women if we assume that patriarchy was putting women at a disadvantage previously 
Feminism,1615400214,The term  toxic masculinity does   not  mean that masculinity masculine traits etc are inherently  toxic  The term is used to describe how specific ideas of masculinity are thrust upon men in ways that are toxic to them and to others For example being naturally stoic is not an inherently toxic trait Making a man believe that he must be stoic and not express his emotions lest he seem like  less of a man is toxic That man may have emotions that need a healthy outlet and if he does not think he should seek one he may suffer negative effects to his own mental health and or take out his emotions in unhealthy ways on others 
Feminism,1615400024, toxic masculinity was coined in the   s by the mythopoetic men s movement not by Gillette in       toxic masculinity does not mean that all men or masculinity is bad it is a specific term used to discuss aspects of traditional masculinity that when borne out to their extremes hurt men and others around them the idea that  men should just cry more is an extreme oversimplification the only socially approved method of emotional expression for men is anger we tell men from day  that  boys don t cry   man up   tough it out  etc like why do you think men are so reluctant to ask for help if they are suffering from anxiety depression etc  we don t raise boys with the emotional toolboxes they need to work through a lot of feelings and emotions that they  just like any other person  has  feminists want to remove gender is also not really the case most feminists advocate for the end of gender  roles  we don t want to make it so that gender does not exist or is not known we just want people to feel free to do whatever they want outside of the constraints of what we think men or women  should be do look like act like patriarchy    men bad patriarchy is also not disproven by having a female political leader if    of your government is male having a female political leader doesn t mean much 
Feminism,1615399321,I live in Idaho where they are trying to pass a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy and they are trying to pass ANOTHER bill that would penalize any organization that provides abortions  Yes this scares me but more than anything I m just fucking pissed Particularly in Idaho we have had zero state legislation to help people in the pandemic since the start of the year Due to this the eviction moratorium is not effective there are still entire counties of people protesting masks and our vaccine distribution has been a frking mess We have so many issues that affect the entire population right now and what are they spending their legislative time on Trying to pass oppressive and harmful legislation My fucking tax dollars should not be paying people to sit around and try to decide something that was decided long ago Women have the right to choose  When they passed Roe in the first place it was because thousands of women were dying trying to self abort or engaging in black market abortions This was an epidemic with only one cure safe and legal abortions  So yeah it s pretty scary but really just more rage inducing than anything else   amp  x   B Phew sorry for the rant  lt

Feminism,1615468377,The real question you should ask is  is it OK for younger women to date older man 
Feminism,1615468346,The issue that makes the difference is entitlement Some people believe that sexual frustration entitles men to sex with women 
Feminism,1615467965,So true I have no problem with all the women on US shows being ridiculously attractive tv is stupid and shallow and we all know  some of us at least that it s not real but then I want the men to be equally hot  In a true egalitarian society everyone should feel insecure and inferior watching television with their SO  
Feminism,1615467818,I mean from personal experience women are not exactly happy if you refuse their sexual advances  I wouldn t call that  entitlement but I don t think there s a huge difference between the sexes 
Feminism,1615467499, gt To me objectification is treating something as an object but not claiming it to be  just that object especially not outside of the scope of the objectification What do you mean by  treating something as an object and  the scope of objectification  Could you give an example  amp  x   B  gt the objectification doesn t grant me the right to treat them as  just objects like you go on Nothing grants the right to treat someone as an object Yet it happens  Perceiving someone as an object results in treating someone as an object For example if you think that I am superior to you let s say I m your boss you ll behave differently to me more respectful and careful than how you would behave if I was your employee This navigation in our behavior happens at a subconscious level but is shaped by our own perceptions 
Feminism,1615467325,I can t remember the name of the book though That s why I m asking I figure I may come across it if I keep looking  There were specific workhouses for unwed mothers as well in Victorian England  can t recall what happened to them later  And the pushback against these shelters in USA was precisely because they were for fallen women who society didn t think were worthy of aid Except I don t have a source for any of this since I can t remember the name of the book 
Feminism,1615467062, gt Sorry I mean why is objectification dehumanizing Because we are not objects We are sentient we feel we experience the world we re aware We re alive Saying someone is an object is saying they re not alive or that their life has no value or worth   gt Why is this a bad thing Wouldn t you say that a person s body is a thing Would you be happy if people treated your body like a meatsack A vessel Would you like to be groped or handled as a thing Because that s what we do with objects  The body itself can be a  thing  however humans and animals aren t simply their bodies We have consciousness awareness sentience But for you knowledge even when a human is non aware in a coma it s a human not a thing    gt   Object a thing that you can     see       or     touch       but that is not usually a     living        animal        plant     or     person          gt A specific individual material entity especially one that is not living or not sentient     amp  x   B  gt It seems to me like the bad part is the presumably unwanted invasive sexualization and not the objectification  Objectification doesn t need to be sexual as I stated and exemplified with the Holocaust analogy Hitler objectified non aryans and didn t needed to sexualize them

Feminism,1615466303,Wow Fantastic take As a dude this tracks very well with my own experiences 
Feminism,1615465705, gt Objectification means that you reduce a WHOLE PERSON  with personality values ideals dreams opinions feelings and all that stuff you know  to their bodies and looks So far I would agree  gt This is dehumanizing  To me objectification is treating something as an object but not claiming it to be  just that object especially not outside of the scope of the objectification Hence if I were to objectify someone I d still recognize the rest of their personhood but just not concern myself with it in the particular matter  gt Their opinions and feelings do not matter because they are not humans but objects To me the notion of something being human and and an object are not mutually exclusive A peron s body is an object to me that doesn t detach the rest of that person from the human  personality values ideals dreams opinions feelings though and thus the objectification doesn t grant me the right to treat them as  just objects like you go on 
Feminism,1615465495, gt Why Could you elaborate For example the Holocaust Hitler only considered important valuable esteemed those who were Aryans They were true Germans So therefore anyone who didn t fit his standards didn t had worth so could be killed and enslaved  Hitler didn t saw fellow humans as equals he took their humanities when stated that they could be killed enslaved and that their lives didn t mattered   gt Could you define your interpretation of  objectification for me please  Objectification is treating people and animals sometimes as objects as things  Through the course of history women couldn t vote couldn t decide their futures couldn t choose their spouses They were objects of bargain marriage was created to form alliances This still happens as a group treatment thankfully in the west things are more progressive however many countries and regions still remain this behaviors bounded by law or not   gt Objectifying to me means focusing on the body of someone  This objectification is sexualization but objectification does necessarily means something sexual   gt but I don t see how that s enabling someone to now  own them  In milder cases saying someone s ass is nice doesn t always translate as disrespect and objectifying However if this someone goes up to a stranger and say this randomly in a  non appropriate place such as club  where maybe the stranger is there to flirt or not  this can be seem as objectifying because you merely say something invasive about someone s body regardless of how they ll feel  In worse cases men will see women s bodies as vessels for them So they ll abuse grope assault and rape them Because women s no is not relevant for them 
Feminism,1615465172,Most rapists aren t motivated by a strong desire for sex Generally it s about power because they can not because they are so sexually frustrated they just have to have sex 
Feminism,1615464796, gt When this is done in a structural level you literally considers less human  Why Could you elaborate  gt When women as a group are objectified Under my current understanding of  objectifying  the notion of objectifying a group of people is incoherent so I guess it s really a different semantic interpretation of  objectification  Could you define your interpretation of  objectification for me please Objectifying to me means focusing on the body of someone without denying them the rest of their personhood but merely not concerning yourself with it at that moment I would expect something like someone saying  they have a nice ass to be seen as objectification but I don t see how that s enabling someone to now  claim them as their ownership 
Feminism,1615464624,What is NOT wrong with objectification Objectification means that you reduce a WHOLE PERSON  with personality values ideals dreams opinions feelings and all that stuff you know  to their bodies and looks This is   dehumanizing    Objectification of women is one of the major causes why many women and young girls starting from the age of   have physical and psychological health problems related to their looks such as eating disorders anorexia anxiety depression  More importantly it is one of the building blocks of the notion that women are bodies and commodities that are owned by others and exist for others This notion is exactly the reason why women are not seen as equals and are mistreated abused violated  Their opinions and feelings do not matter because they are not humans but objects so I can treat them however I like  Sounds plausible right Consider how black people are still being mistreated abused and violated today because they were enslaved owned and not seen as equals by white people for centuries Consider the mass murder of the  uncivilized Native Indians by the  civilized white men and the mass murder of the  untermensch Jews by the   bermench Nazis Objectification leads to dehumanization which in turn leads to violence and social injustice This is not a far fetch but a psychological fact 
Feminism,1615464303,The root of it in the US seems to be the grip that Christianity still has on some people Always amazes me looking across the Atlantic and seeing attitudes that seem hundreds of years out of place Not trying to demean all Christians though just an observation 
Feminism,1615464274,You know despite commenting earlier re size strength differences in men and the likelihood of female sexual assault i think your  benevolent sexism angle makes sense   Walking non woman friends home is good too  We should all look out for each other for sure 
Feminism,1615463129,Everything  But ok let me break it down  When you objectify a person you dehumanizes them which means you compare and atributes value as if they were the same as a chair When this is done in a structural level you literally considers less human even if they re the same species as you and sentient When women as a group are objectified men as the power holding group and majority think that they own these  objects   Which leads us to fathers thinking they own their wives and daughters and can say what they dress with what they can watch where they can go etc When romantic partners do this is the same and sometimes these objectification causes the death of these women who seemingly can t make their own decisions if these men don t approve it

Feminism,1615461265,There is no fucking egalitarian movement or coherent philosophical tradition It s a word misogynist men use to invalidate feminism I don t have patience for your type 
Feminism,1615460843,This is not a grand theory but when I m sexually frustrated I can just well masturbate  If I want to have a sex with a person to me it s more more about loneliness intimacy excitement validation connection It makes me wonder if men conflate a physical need with emotional status and identity needs 
Feminism,1615460174,Women experience sexual frustration we just don t tend to have a sense that we are entitled to have someone do something about it 
Feminism,1615460137,I m a woman that occasionally dates younger men My stance  in theory is that anyone over    the legal age of consent here is an adult deserves respect and is free to do what they want with who they want  That said there is a HUGE power difference that comes with age it s incredibly difficult to navigate and very easy to take advantage of Older people generally have more financial resources more self confidence know more about how the world works It s very easy to influence groom or manipulate a younger person who is still figuring themselves out I ve been very careful and I m still shocked at times to see what kind of influence I had on younger partners and friends I shudder to think what someone with bad or even callous intentions could do I m guessing society thinks it s not possible to take advantage of younger men as easy as younger women   You can use them for sex but that s what young men want in the first place right   The most vulnerable group of young men I ve seen are in their early   s They ve just finished college they don t have a job yet and don t have a girlfriend All of their college friends are getting jobs getting married and moving away while their own life seems to be in limbo The seem to literally exist in a vacuum waiting for their life to start but unable to get it started They are extremely susceptible to an older person just taking them under their wing  So um   in short there might be infantilization of younger women but a relationship with a significant age gap is a power imbalance that should be taken seriously in any relationship 
Feminism,1615460028,I agree I mean lots of women go through the same and they don t believe themselves entitled to men s bodies 
Feminism,1615459733,I just don t understand what the conflict of feminism is if you admit that masculinity has positive traits 
Feminism,1615459612,but women dont generally rape or molest other men because of their needs whereas men do because of entitlement
Feminism,1615459541,thats an interesting article but i dont think it explains male privilege to      just one side of it  
Feminism,1615459534,If you mean it like that it s about as helpful as saying  people are atoms Obviously people are biological neural networks  well people are the rest of their bodies too but that s besides the point that s what brains are How is it relevant in any way You re trying to sound more scientific while your point isn t deep at all and doesn t really connect with the topic at hand very well at all 
Feminism,1615458860,A commenter on this sub linked this article recently and it s blown my mind  How Extreme Need Leads to Male Entitlement  
Feminism,1615458573,In addition to the other comments it s also a good idea to offer to walk men home  Don t know the crime statistics where you are but when I was young and lived in a city the area where I and most of my friends lived had a big issue with mugging and not so much with strangers assaulting or raping women walking alone and I had some guy friends who were mugged  none of the women in my circle were partly out of luck and partly because we were used to practicing situational awareness when alone and learned to be more safety conscious  I would say there is a bit of benevolent sexism to only asking women if they need a walk home but I put that more on a cultural issue rather than a you issue  we certainly hear a lot how things aren t safe for women and often they aren t so it s not bad to want to help keep people safe So long story short nothing wrong with offering respect the answer you get and it s also probably a good idea to offer anyone regardless of gender a walk home if you are someone with really good situational awareness personal safety habits 
Feminism,1615458509,People are neural networks Humans are not artificial neural networks yes The point is precisely in the need for conclusions with a lack of information  And learning of course 
Feminism,1615458265,To answer this you ll have to look back at the history of how women and their sexuality was and often still is treated to this very day For women talking about their sexuality over history it s been seen as taboo Or they ve been called terrible names for being sexually independent and making the choice to have sex It s still an issue with people today A lot of partners are obsessed with how much sexual experience their partner has Or if they won t have sex with one particular person there s a chance that she ll be called a prude Even women who don t feel sexual attraction like people who fall on the asexual spectrum are often told that having sex could  fix them Women have been taught to handle their own sexual frustrations Whereas men are often still encouraged to talk about having sex in a manner that they are getting something that they should all experience This is damaging to everyone since many of them aren t taught to handle their own sexual frustration in a healthy manner And women are left to minimize their own sexuality 
Feminism,1615458154,Of course women experience sexual frustration But women are conditioned to not talk so much about their sexual desire for fear of being labelled a slut or worse 
Feminism,1615457770,This is definitely something that s true if you watch British television then you can see it for sure In American women have some ridiculously high beauty standards thrown at them all the time From advertisements television magazines anything and you can probably find that it only has the prettiest women plastered on the front telling women that THIS is how they can look If only they put in a little effort and bought the products As for men in television if they re wanted to watch it then there is usually someone relatable to them Or someone that they want to be This is why you ll see the range from average looking guys up through model looking guys With average men they can relate to them and with good looking men that s someone that they might want to be  Women aren t expected to relate to characters on their looks

Feminism,1615457407,You don t see older women dating younger men nearly as much though when it does happen there s a big issue of a power imbalance I think a big term in all of this isn t infantilization but a type of grooming If someone takes a young vulnerable and socially dependant person and puts them in a situation they can t leave from easily it s sort of isolating them from what a typical situation for them at that age might be If there s any type of power imbalance in a relationship that makes it so someone else can t leave easily then there s a big issue overall

Feminism,1615457371,My country South Africa should serve as an example to many Since the fall of apartheid in South Africa the representation of black people in the media has both increased and become more realistic and nuanced as opposed to only hearing the propaganda of a racist regime   However a shift in the political class and shifts in representation alone do not translate into big changes within the economic structure of society As a white South African I live in what is essentially a bubble of first world amenities Whereas the majority of the population  black still live in deep poverty This is the lagacy of apartheid town planning  which was a more extreme version of redlining     This racist legacy is actually very persistent and has little to do with the  racist or otherwise attitudes of people now I live in a monster of a house that is worth literally millions which I could never have afforded on my current salary But my grandparents got it under the apartheid regime dirt cheap because it zoned and developed land for white people  Now my black colleagues who work with me earning similar or even more cannot afford to move into my area just as I could not I just happen to live there in a house in the richest area of my city already so don t need to earn enough money to pay millions for a house Also my ownership of this property means I can leverage it and aquire debt  if needed very easily at favourable rates because the banks see that asset in my portfolio Whereas for my black colleagues with the same salary are unable to leverage to get the same debt at favourable rates Which means in South Africa white people still  mostly live in rich areas and black people still  mostly live in poorer areas Now in that the laws of the country are no longer racist black people have trickled into my neighborhood   They however are not middle class because middle class couldn t actually afford to move into the area they are often rich  Disney is NEVER going to critique society at the level of economic structure It sells feel good attitudes to people and is very happy with the economic status quo because it sits up at the tops of that heirachy 
Feminism,1615457201,There are a lot of things that come into play when you re talking about why it takes so long for something like this to happen A good deal of societies used to see women as second class citizens we ve moved up in the world but there s still a lot of stigmas It takes a lot to change the hearts and minds of everyone on the planet And sometimes that s something you can t do in just one generation Some people just don t want to see others as equal you can see different occurrences of this all over the place If they look and see what they re doing is wrong then they have to admit that for their entire life they ve been doing it 
Feminism,1615457003,The question that s relevant here is did she ask you to walk her home It s true that you should hold the door out to anyone who is coming behind you And you should talk about how a meal is paid for Split it pay for your own half or take turns paying for the meal The thing about walking someone home is they have to trust you enough to let you know where they live  Especially if someone lives alone 
Feminism,1615456414,Okay Thanks I figured it wasn t really a good option but I m pretty socially inept and didn t know how else to approach lol 
Feminism,1615456250,Dangerous people would also say all those things so that doesn t really help  But when you offer to walk her home it s nice to make clear somehow that her refusing is an option and not a big deal to you like um   Hey it s late do you want me to walk you home If you prefer to go by yourself that s fine too   
Feminism,1615455912,I m from Scotland and as a kid used to truly wonder if the British were genetically inferior Like we ve been breeding within this tiny island for so long we ve messed up our gene pool thus creating vast differences in female attractiveness between here and the USA Then I spent some time there and realised I d been hoodwinked by the media   although our pasty skin could still do with some help

Feminism,1615455262,This wasn t something I even considered Would I just simply say straight out that I m not trying to find out where she lives for malicious intentions Or is there a better way to be reassuring Do friends worry about this as well If they agree to my question should I reassure them on the way to their home as well 
Feminism,1615454266,If you are in a date situation there s some additional concerns the women in question might question your motives about wanting to walk her home After you walked her home you know where she lives You may attempt to invite yourself in or use it as leverage    Well I walked all this way the least you can do is invite me in     These are certainly things that run through my mind when a date offers to walk or drive me home Which isn t to say   Don t do it   But it s good to keep in mind 
Feminism,1615453201,Basically every human is indoctrinated into gender roles from before they can walk talk and throughout most of their lives Its really difficult to shift at large scales views that are so ingrained that they appear almost axiomatic to most people I think that to me the only hope is gradual incremental change over generations 
Feminism,1615452867,Hey dude Amazing points you made Don t fret too much  for a lot of people speaking in general not meaning anyone specific   anyone that has a different view to them becomes a  mra or an  incel  Learn not to get too affected by it There are thousands and thousands of people who would probably agree with you just not on here   
Feminism,1615452479,Atleast you agree feminism is not for men    I mean its literally in the name FEMinism
Feminism,1615452056,I don t think it s sexist It makes sense for  on average physically larger and stronger people to protect physically smaller and weaker people women tend to be safer when accompanied by men and there is safety in numbers  The basic logic could apply to other situations  an abled person accompanying a disabled person or a person of the dominant local racial group accompanying someone of a less common group in a less accepting area There s only really a problem if the man views the women as inherently less competent and or tries to make her accept an escort  Not implying you ve done will do these  
Feminism,1615449452,A lot of media has a tendency to portray bigotry as actions by individuals towards individuals and the solution to bigotry as individuals changing their individual behaviors  This is a lazy copout Racism isn t just the kkk burning wooden crosses or neonazi chanting about Jews replacing them Racism is when Black men receive harsher punishments than white men for the same crimes degrading Black neighborhoods ability to recovery economically Racism is when doctors don t know what it looks like when a Black woman is in pain Racism is when Donald Trump gets away with serial rape but Anthony Weiner goes to prison for sexting Most importantly racism is a system most of us contribute to by participating in the institutions that impose it   Sexism is likewise systemic but I m not the best person here to go into detail about that  From that perspective Ellis is right bigotry can t be overcome with platitudes and tokenism because it requires us to recognize our role in it and work towards dismantling norms and institutions It doesn t matter how many people see a Black protagonist in Princess and the Frog if we don t address redlining and generational poverty  Of course representation has value which I assume that Lindsay mentions But representation alone does not undo oppression no matter how good and unracist unsexist we feel while watching it

Feminism,1615439991,In addition to ugly men appearing on tv and movies they also don t need to be good at acting  Talented women struggle to get roles if they aren t exceptionally beautiful or if they are past   years old Even if they do end up getting a role it is usually acting to be someone s mother or some other minor role behind a man  If a woman if described as ugly she usually is a gorgeous famous actress wearing glasses braces and messy hair and still by the end of the film turns out to be beautiful after all while the  lesson of the film being that looks don t matter  Anne Hathaway in Devil wears Prada America Ferrera in Ugly Betty

Feminism,1615438651,Hey dude just wanted to throw out a thank you for asking the question in such a thoughtful way     I find  chivalry to be sexist and i don t generally like being treated different on the basis of my sex  But there are undeniable biological differences where the average male body is stronger than the average female body and then of course women are more likely to be targeted by sexual predators   So as a woman i have appreciated guy friends or partners who care about my safety and offer to walk me home 
Feminism,1615438221,I think the more precise question to ask is are we okay with this double standard White power and  male power  no one really uses that one have been historical phenomena with violent genocidal histories Whereas things like  black power or  girl power  a rather dated phrase represent an affirmation of the value of historically marginalized groups in society White male power seeks to dominate others whereas black girl power seeks to fight back against that domination Because recent history is worse with one it elicits a stronger visceral disgust towards it The problem I see is that shunning one while permitting the other does leave open the potential for people to abuse it like with redefining racism as being  prejudice plus power  which is clearly a self serving modality to excuse black racism While one wrong is worse than the other we should acknowledge that two wrongs still don t make a right 
Feminism,1615438068,Nope  I ve sometimes been walked home by others and I have walked others home  and I used to live as a man before I transitioned If things are likely not safe or if someone is tipsy or may not be able to defend themselves it is a pretty decent thing to do    If you have men in your life who are in a vulnerable state you better make the offer to them too  only making the offer to women can be sexist

Feminism,1615435492, I ve noticed it also   Others have commented on British TV  I ve been watching an interesting French TV dramady on Netflix  Call My Agent  about a talent agency in Paris  The difference between the women in it and those on many American shows is immediately noticeable  One of the lead characters would never appear on an American show because of her nose  Early on the show made a point of emphasizing how how American female actors are constantly pressured into plastic surgery when one of the French women is pressured and declines  I think the wide range of normal women on this French show is an essential part of this show s high quality by allowing for better character differentiation and depth 
Feminism,1615434389, gt rape is never considered  manly   Of course no one is going to admit to it When men are told that their masculinity is directly correlated with their partner count then you re going to see men getting sex by force This is what leads some men to commit rape and also leads to male rape victims of women rapists to be congratulated   Rape culture  I know you heard this term before is about acknowledging that certain commonly held beliefs result in rape and victim blaming    gt none of those behaviors are looked up as something to be positive    Yet so much rape persists
Feminism,1615433785,This is part of why I think I often prefer British tv shows as an American woman  that and I appreciate dry humor  
Feminism,1615433723,rape is never considered  manly  whacking a stranger on road for no apparent reason is never termed  manly  that s physical assault fighting your siblings for fun isn t physical attack and creating a submissive dominant equation between two consenting adult isn t rape  i don t know who s pushing this idea but no society or group of sane individual rewards  rape as manly behavior none of those behaviors are looked up as something to be positive about and this holds true even for the neckbeards who just want to fill their bellies with beer and ride their Harley 
Feminism,1615433590,I have noticed this as well In almost any British show I have caught people of all genders are only slightly above average in their attractiveness or average and it is their acting and character center stage That is not to say acting is not on point in American shows  it is but it definitely does seem there is more emphasis and necessity on having good looking people in the acting industry Some of my friends have noticed this too and in fact one of my best friends  who has watched a lot more shows than me pointed this out to me And of course that physical attractiveness emphasis and standard is disproportionately on women I do not know enough but I do wonder if this is a mirror to American society

Feminism,1615479917,This is a great example of how gender roles hurt people Men are expected to be willing and eager for sex all the time which is a lot of pressure for them Then when women get their feelings hurt by being turned down in an instance they feel insecure because  men are supposed to always want sex and what s wrong with me that he doesn t want it with me   Not the point you were trying to make but I m making it for you 
Feminism,1615479875,When people sexually harrass a woman outside she may not be experiencing violence but what we hear from that stranger is  I have no boundaries or respect towards strangers and I ve noticed YOU and I ve targeted YOU  Anything can happen after that and it s terrifying 
Feminism,1615479806, gt many feminists refuse to work with groups like the MRA uh yeah we SHOULD be on the same side but they kind of fucking hate us their whole schtick is being reactionaries  against feminism and many  if not most of them are raging misogynists  gt egalitarians They re not a  group  They don t do anything They re just people who are at best fine with the status quo and at worst are just anti feminists who ve put on the mantle of  I just want equality to avoid looking sexist  gt even parts of the lgbt community What are you referring to here TERFs 
Feminism,1615479027, gt your data will be skewed by the fact that women fearing for their safety while outside at night may be less likely to be out late and therefore less likely to be victims of violent crime simply because they remain at home This is a super important point Women are also less likely to be outside  alone for similar reasons and thus are less attractive targets for robbery 
Feminism,1615479017,Isn t anti capitalist movies the very definition of commodifying the revolution 
Feminism,1615478824,From the abstract  Adjustment was made for prior mental health status   There was no significant association between number of sex partners and later anxiety and depression   Increasing numbers of sex partners were associated with   increasing risk of substance dependence disorde  r at all three ages  So it seems that the main correlation they found was about substance abuse not other mental illnesses This makes sense to me given that many drugs  especially stimulant like meth and cocaine can cause sharp increase in sex drive and decrease in inhibition leading to compulsive sexual behavior Addicts also report difficulty maintaining long term romantic relationship so it makes sense that they would switch partners more often than people with stable relationships 
Feminism,1615478652,In America  males experienced higher victimization rates than females for all types of violent crime except rape sexual assault   
Feminism,1615478313,Correct It s awful for all the reasons and often the acting suffers too I watch a lot of TV from abroad and I ve noticed this for decades 
Feminism,1615478262,Well if you re not interested in charitable discussion that is fine I never said all stories had to be economic or class stories did I  I never made any claims about revolutions you are putting things into my mouth and all I was trying to do was be honest and explain how I saw things You seem to be after a fight Perhaps someone else will be down for that   But not me well not today anyway 
Feminism,1615477955,Then you should be happy and thankful that Disney isn t trying to be anti capitalist Why do you want your revolution commodified Also why are people unable to accept that in a fictional world a monarchy isn t neccecarily an oppressive system like it is in real life since you know it s not real  So your saying that representation is a liberal thing and progressives generally don t see it as progressive unless it s in the       percent of movies that portray systems of oppression being dismanteled

Feminism,1615477556,I don t really think this study shows that having multiple sexual partners is harmful or that  promiscuous sex causes or leads to depression anxiety and substance abuse issues I think what it shows is that certain risky behaviors and certain mental illnesses tend to coexist and having  promiscuous sex is classified as a risky behavior especially for women People with anxiety depression or other issues may self medicate which can include promiscuous sex and substance abuse Correlation is not causation here I also would like to know what the definition of  promiscuity is here People often talk about it as though it s some definite thing but when asked what that actually means don t seem to have a concrete answer Is it ten partners Twenty Thirty What about serial monogamy Occasional hookups or casual sex Some people think  five partners is  promiscuous  Is it I personally have zero issues with anyone having as much sex with as many people as they want provided the sex is consensual and they are engaging in mutually respectful safe encounters 
Feminism,1615477516,And being mugged is still influenced by gender I was mugged at knifepoint while in the woods with a partner a while back and he said a big reason he cooperated was his fear that I would be sexually assaulted Neither of us were concerned that  he might be sexually assaulted 
Feminism,1615477480,The question then becomes what you mean by progressive v standard liberal politics  Standard liberal politics is one which is only concerned with setting things up such that we have more women and black and black women billionaires They will set up some welfare programs unlike libertarians but finally when all is said and done the deep structural economic inequalities will remain Liberals are not racist but they are Capitalists Progressives as a political movement generally are like a Bernie Sanders or an AOC both are not racist and are interested in structural economic reforms   Reducing burdens created by massive inequality and setting up a system which minimizes the possibility of such inequalities to arise within the economy at all  Also don t under estimate Capitalism it will happily make a profit on anti Capitalist sentiment without blinking an eye Mass printing Che Guevara  a big anti capitalist icon on red t shirts and selling them to lefty teens from rich backgrounds is something Capitalists not only would do they do it  Disney s decisions with respect to all this is all about branding marketing and sales 
Feminism,1615477466,That s an interesting fact Women remaining at home for fear definitely needs to be taken into account Otherwise the analysis will be very much misleading

Feminism,1615477185, gt Men are way more likely to be victims of violent crimes when outside Are men more likely to be victims of violent crimes than women  when both are outside  or simply more likely to be victims of violent crimes than women are I ask because if you aren t comparing  men who are outside at night to  women who are outside at night  your data will be skewed by the fact that women fearing for their safety while outside at night may be less likely to be out late and therefore less likely to be victims of violent crime simply because they remain at home 
Feminism,1615477170,And that hinges on the definition of  object  does it not 
Feminism,1615477123,I would     rather be mugged than sexually assaulted or raped These two crimes are not comparable Someone taking your purse or wallet or watch or whatever sucks and is scary but you can replace those things

Feminism,1615476925,You have to look up your local statistics I don t know where you live 
Feminism,1615476882,Haha this isn t about philosophy here You are looking into the wrong dictionary This is about objectification of people  
Feminism,1615476824,According to left wing people now respectful representation of women isn t progressive unless there s messages about dismantiling systems of oppression to back it up
Feminism,1615476754, gt unabh ngig vom Bewusstsein existierende Erscheinung der materiellen Welt auf die sich das Erkennen die Wahrnehmung richtet What part of being matter is dehumanizing As far as I m concerned everyone is always an object and objectification is the act of interpreting someone trough their object body alone without considering metaphysicals 
Feminism,1615476682,Yes it matters The point of this sub is so that people who come here can get a specifically feminist perspective from people who are educated on the topic Given that just yesterday you were asking to learn more about feminism and your demonstrated lack of familiarity with feminist discourse you are not qualified to give that perspective Your participation is relegated to nested comments only Further argument on this point will result in a ban 
Feminism,1615476583,That s correct There is also a handy picture example in the initial removal comment 
Feminism,1615476483,Objectification means  making someone into an object  Dehumanization is part of the definition 
Feminism,1615476361,Literally no one said that it s gonna fix everything But how does that mean that there s nothing progressive about it at all in other ways Also wouldn t you claim that Focus Features also has no interest in changing the economic structure that sets people at a disadvantage And yet they made a movie that tells the viewers that unionizing is good and storming a CEO s house is good So is it just Disney 
Feminism,1615476230,Honestly if you re adamant that objectification isn t dehumanizing there s only much I can argue  Humans don t see themselves as objects nor see animals or plants as objects A chair is an object a table a book But a cat is not an object it s a living being a dog is not an object At least for most humans it s this way as far as I perceive  If you don t think it is that s ok It s your opinion However women feel that is does dehumanize it Just because it does hurt you it doesn t mean it doesn t hurt others It requires empathy to understand this too 
Feminism,1615476134,No representation can be a good thing even without being attached to an economic critique People even those traditionally excluded from doing so have stories to tell of their lives that do not involve political or economic analysis   Allowing those stories to be told is good It allows us to see the humanity in each other But representation alone isn t going to be the magic bullet fix of the structural legacies we have inherited from our history Consider the one percent if grandfather s left the billions to grand daughters there would be more representation But the basic structure of wealth distribution would not have changed at all  Disney as I see it is kind of like that They have no problem with women or black people becoming super rich and moving into the    representation  But they have NO interest in changing the economic structure that set people at a disadvantage because they are beneficiaries of that system  I don t see disney as being  afraid necessarily more that a multinational organisation like Disney has no incentive to change how things are done having black and female executives is  good on the surface But the machine hidden beneath that service would remain largely untouched 
Feminism,1615475958, gt Objects are indeed required to be non living  anything that is visible or tangible and is relatively stable in form    something material that may be perceived by the senses    a material thing that can be seen and touched    in german but similar to before  
Feminism,1615475954,I feel like you re confusing liking someone s physical feature and objectification There s a clear distinction between the two Let s take your example You look at a woman You think she has a nice ass You approach and meet her In this example a couple of things matter First the look Is it a glance or a gaze Second the context Is this woman a business partner you meet in a professional setting Are you in a more comfortable setting like a party at a friend s house Third the encounter How do you approach her Are you polite Are you in a position maybe too close where you could possibly make her uncomfortable Let s say you see her at a party and think she is sexy In one scenario you approach her introduce yourself and start a conversation in a polite manner This is not objectification In another scenario you approach her check her out from head to toe and then say  hey sexy  This is objectification There s nothing wrong with liking someone s physical feature and being drawn to it This is completely natural There s nothing wrong with complimenting someone in a polite way either  obviously not like  you have a nice ass   What s wrong is to REDUCE people to their physical features consciously or subconsciously If you respect women and see them as humans you ll act like in scenario   If you subliminally think of women as objects you ll act like in scenario   Regardless of which both of these approaches are stemmed from your own perception of women That s why how you think of and perceive women matter quite a lot The thing is though while some men who have an objectifying sexist perception of women openly exhibit abusive and violent behavior physically and sexually many men who have the same perception of women do not act that way and they are not even aware of their own perception Objectification of women in media commercials movies porn perpetuates the notion that women are physical and sexual objects for male pleasure and they are not real human beings with their own desires opinions feelings etc As a result many men develop an unrealistic hypersexualized perception of women which manifests itself as emotional abuse and power play in close relationships and it harms women s emotional well being One example from my own life is my ex who loved me from the bottom of his heart acknowledged me as a person cared about my opinions Yet he used to criticize me for not being sexy      not wearing make up not being  feminine enough  According to him I was supposed to wear sexy outfits at home compromising my need of being comfortable in my safe space He wasn t even aware that he was asking me to act as a sexual object for his pleasure Objectification goes much further than it seems
Feminism,1615475721,I can justify calling the sexual harassment being bad because it can cause harm to the person I don t see the justification for calling the objectification bad without the definition of such making it inherently dehumanizing which is fair but not part of my initial interpretation question

Feminism,1615475587, gt I think you re confusing objectification in the sense of  to acknowledge the physicality of a person with the one that is meant when people discuss  objectification which is  to focus on the physical attributes of a person to the exclusion of all else   No I do think of the second interpretation but very limited in application The example I ve used to far being that I see a person in a bar or something and objectify them to essentially perform  visual attraction analysis if that makes sense I acknoledge the entirety of the person but only consider their physicality for that moment that is everything else is not part of my conscious thought So indeed reducing them to nothing but physical attributes but keeping in mind that those are only a part of what makes the person whole as well as not letting that objectification being a salient factor of your interpretation of them as a person in the long term  gt You claim to think about people s bodies without losing sight of their personhood thoughts feelings etc In which case you are not objectifying them You are thinking about their physical bodies sure but not to the exclusion of other factors That is not what is meant by the term used in feminism  and broader when people discuss objectification You seem to be on board with the idea that reducing people only to their physical traits and ignoring all else about them stripping them of thoughts feelings agency is bad So you a likely going to agree that objectification in that sense which is the one meant when people discuss how objectification is harmful is not a good thing and has the potential to be harmful That seems to be the conclusive answer 
Feminism,1615475289, gt I believe victims But isn t that statement circular reasoning  It presupposes that the alleged victim is in fact a victim  The revelation that she lied under oath repeatedly is devastating to her credibility 
Feminism,1615475111,Well that s it for me I ve said all I had to say  Objects are indeed required to be non living If they e living they re a being be it a plant of animal 
Feminism,1615475016,She says that there s nothing progressive at all about representation unless it s backed by a deep analysis of structures and hierarchies  She doesn t once state how they could have made remakes of Aladdin and The Lion King with these messages appropriate for  year olds Also anti capitalists who think that they d be happy with Disney if they did make movies like this are wrong If they did anti capitalists would get angry at them for  commodifying the revolution So you should be glad that they aren t
Feminism,1615474909,I mean   okay My life is perfectly fulfilled without children and yours may not be and that s fine It s not  sad  it s just different people wanting different things out of life It s also rather rude to assume that someone cannot or is not  educating and forming the next generation because they do not have children of their own That is far and away not the only way to contribute 
Feminism,1615474886, gt You plainly ignored the two sources I provided  How is conceeding that based on the alternate interpretation of  object  you can indeed call objectification bad  ignoring those sources They form a centerpiece of my argumemt now  gt However I think you do need to realize or at least respect that just because you don t understand a concept or a logic it doesn t mean it s incorrect  Which is why I have conceeded given the alternative interpretation of  object   gt Objectification is harmful to women Women feel bad bothered and disgusted Do you understand this If going by the definition of object that requires it to be non living i e objectification  is intrinsically dehumanizing yes 
Feminism,1615474741,So the only way for representation to even be a little progressive is if it s backed up by an economic critique And the reason why Disney doesn t do this isn t because their afraid of inspiring people to start a revolution or something They don t do it because they make movies that are supposed to be entertaining and easy to follow for  year olds
Feminism,1615474682,I mean I m a man and I like children and want to be a father Not that you have to like the same things as me just cause you are a women but a life without doing all I can to educate and form the next generation to be as good as they can be   Sounds kinda sad to me
Feminism,1615474221, gt How do you reconcile this with the fact that I objectify people but care about how they feel what they want and whether I ll hurt them Then by definition you re not actually objectifying them 
Feminism,1615473831,I mean I  can believe they re being downvoted because what they said doesn t have much to do with the comment they re replying to  But I m pretty sure you re just here to stir shit

Feminism,1615473445,I think you re confusing objectification in the sense of  to acknowledge the physicality of a person with the one that is meant when people discuss  objectification which is  to focus on the physical attributes of a person to the exclusion of all else   You claim to think about people s bodies without losing sight of their personhood thoughts feelings etc In which case you are not objectifying them You are thinking about their physical bodies sure but not to the exclusion of other factors That is not what is meant by the term used in feminism  and broader when people discuss objectification  You seem to be on board with the idea that reducing people only to their physical traits and ignoring all else about them stripping them of thoughts feelings agency is bad So you a likely going to agree that objectification in that sense which is the one meant when people discuss how objectification is harmful is not a good thing and has the potential to be harmful 
Feminism,1615473424,They are both actually She is being reduced to her sex I m sure you can find other examples 
Feminism,1615473111, gt Now imagine one person treating another person in a sexual way but the other person doesn t want it and doesn t reciprocate For example a man making sexual remarks to a waitress This is objectification It s wrong because it lacks consent Why is the issue the objectification and not the sexual harassment 
Feminism,1615472998,They are trained to say  oh honey don t worry about it it was good  regardless   
Feminism,1615472850,The lack of consent Imagine two adults who are mutually sexually attracted by each other they have sex and they enjoy each other s bodies as pure sexual objects Is that wrong Definitely not This isn t objectification It s just sex Now imagine one person treating another person in a sexual way but the other person doesn t want it and doesn t reciprocate For example a man making sexual remarks to a waitress This is objectification It s wrong because it lacks consent 
Feminism,1615472795,Yeah it s a not a perfect article  It tries to explain rape which in feminist theory is  correctly imo thought of as having to do with power and dehumanizing rather than any kind of desire It s heavily anecdotal it s not a     explanation But it does track with most of the consent incidents I ve had in the past year with men who sincerely liked me and cared for me but still pushed or crossed my boundaries 
Feminism,1615472735,The dictionaries that I looked up trend in the direction of you being wrong on that although there seem to be less numerous dictionaries that support it 
Feminism,1615472577, gt Now I m starting to wonder whether you re actually here to learn or to debate Well both Debate is the best way for me to find arguments that I hadn t considered yet It seems that the discrepancy between my interpretation of objectification and the common interpretation is merely what objectification of a person actually means So now I just continue because I both enjoy it and to not miss out on other potential arguments I hadn t considered  gt I said groping and handling as we do with objects non living things Would you grope the microphone of a speaker at a conference Would you say no because such an action has sociological implications Would you say similar such sociological implications can be applied to human bodie as an object and a human body can thus be considered an object that doesn t automatically justify random groping of it  gt I linked two sources with the definitions I provided Sounds like you skipped those two then  I did indeed not do an exhaustive research of dictionary you got me there   gt Then what is the problem That I haven t heard a coherent argument so far that isn t based in part on my conjecture of parts of it I m autistic so it s very hard to me to see the lines of reasoning based on things people would consider to be  obvious social intuition The fact that people are downvoting me and your  Sounds like you skipped those two then doesn t exactly help

Feminism,1615472428,How is my opinion not  feminist women want older successful man that are higher in a social hierarchy cause of the patriarchy
Feminism,1615472422,I m offering up just a personal theory based on my own experiences I used to go to film school You learn about having an artistic eye You also learn very fast that  pretty people make for the easiest subjects They re more fun to look at in writing amd shooting the general population tends to be more willing to form a connection with a character if they re  attractive  It s all   very objectifying At one point in my life I might have thought  eh so what It s up to the artist to decide what inspires them If that happens to be pretty girls so what   But there s a massive problem in all of that One that s kinda so deeply culturally ingrained   I dunno if we can really fix it  we should still try and always work towards it   All that pretty people art all that forging connections to pretty people It makes our whole culture think of  men and women as those larger than life pretty people we obsess over We don t take people as seriously if we don t find them as attractive That happens to men and women but it s worse for women Here s why When a woman is pretty we dress her down we make her sexy Now everyone associates pretty with sexy There s no appreciation for beauty without sexy anymore in a lot of ways Now we just see women as sex objects   and we kind of always have They re  baby ovens that also do housework to a lot of people But women are just as capable as men are They can create the same art engineer the same machines play the same sports and lead the same countries But nobody cares about that We just want to see more pretty people If they aren t pretty why should we relate to them If they aren t sexy what s the point  As a former artist   I don t like that about the art world You could make a strong argument that the fault lies in commodification Artists get snapped up by companies companies use numbers People buy pretty Hey Artist Make us some pretty  But I think a lot of Cis male artists  myself included fall into the trap of only showing what inspires us   and that s usually sexy beautiful women That s just as sexist as a company in many ways  Hope all of that made some semblance of sense Still waiting on my meds to kick in for the day TLDR objectification is bad because it s dehumanizing Dehumanizing is bad for everyone 
Feminism,1615472279,Yes it is She is an adult Also keep in mind that statistically speaking the biggest threat to a woman s safety isn t coming from strangers on the street It s the man who walks her home 
Feminism,1615472009,You are not informed enough about feminism to make top level comments here 
Feminism,1615471988,because a person is not an object they are a person you can make whatever bullshit philosophical argument you want but the fact remains 
Feminism,1615471549, gt It results in bad treatment because then people don t give a shit how you feel what you want or if they hurt you They just do whatever to you and then act offended if you object  How do you reconcile this with the fact that I objectify people but care about how they feel what they want and whether I ll hurt them  gt they don t see you as a person Why are objectification and personhood mutually exclusive 
Feminism,1615471178, gt How does touching something logically follow from that something being an object Now I m starting to wonder whether you re actually here to learn or to debate I didn t say touching I said groping and handling as we do with objects non living things   gt I looked up four dictionaries for this post and none of them mention that part lol  I linked two sources with the definitions I provided Sounds like you skipped those two then   amp  x   B  gt The point is that I don t see how the objectification is the objectionable problem Then what is the problem You ve came to receive answers and a feminist perspective about objectification if you want a debate then this is not the place 
Feminism,1615470650,I think you nailed it It really feels like feminism is in the process of jumping the shark And that s horrible because I don t want to see feminism go away There s much good in it  But it seems like all the years of generalizing men as     potential rapists is starting to have unforeseen effects on the younger feminists where they literally run from and become terrified at the sight of any male I ve literally personally witnessed at least three five woman I ve never met before in my life run and cower in actual fear at the sight of me in broad daylight It s insane  When half the population can t even function around the other half this is how society breaks down 
Feminism,1615470310, gt  treating something as an object As in to merely consider a given entity by it s physical manifestion in a specific instance context If I say  they have a nice ass then I m treating the person as an object a body in the relevant context of me only being able to infer things from visual inspection from afar  gt  the scope of objectification If I now go talk to that person then the horizon of things I know about that person grows beyond their objectification their body The scope of my consideration of them is now their body but also the fact that they study law and like to collect red lawnmowers That is it is not longer specifically an objectification but more than that because more than their mere object body is now relevant  gt Nothing grants the right to treat someone as an object  The reason that I don t grope people is not based on how they are more than an object but because I don t want them to suffer any discomfort harm and I expect society to return the favour to me in return  gt For example if you think that I am superior to you let s say I m your boss you ll behave differently to me more respectfully and carefully than how you would behave if I was your employee This navigation in our behavior happens at a subconscious level but is shaped by our own perceptions But that is only relevent if you consider something being an object as making it ok to grope it for example correct Since I don t consider that to be the case I wouldn t expect my interpretation of objectification to cause subconscious influence on conscious behaviour in a negative way like you suggest 
Feminism,1615470184,No you re right I was thinking about the same thing watching  scrotal recall  
Feminism,1615470143,Very true Lots of people have experiences that  at best  were questionable because one person is pushing 
Feminism,1615469501,Many people do because their prescribed gender role isn t what they really want My gender role says I should like children and want to be a mother But I d be miserable if I did that 
Feminism,1615469353,Conversely I think a lot of date rape   gray rape happens because one person is super horny and the other person didn t technically say no or try to shove them off or whatever so they just go ahead and do what they want A lot of people who are actually rapists thought of what they were doing as  seduction  
Feminism,1615469237,Hi your post has been because it s not a question and isn t really appropriate for this subreddit 
Feminism,1615469175,It results in bad treatment because then people don t give a shit how you feel what you want or if they hurt you They just do whatever to you and then act offended if you object Like if you go to a dance club and men just come up to you and start touching you and grinding on you without asking or even looking you in the face  they don t see you as a person they see you as a sexy piece of furniture that s there for their pleasure 
Feminism,1615469086,Yeah I think religions everywhere flourish on the suppression of women 
Feminism,1615469082,Yes but individuals aren t averages Should you only offer if you re actually stronger or larger than the woman you re asking That would actually be a reasonable stance but it doesn t have anything to do with being a woman I also think you can help simply through safety in numbers

Feminism,1615468601,   holy crap you re right I forgot all about that movie 
Feminism,1615468430,Ironically the successes of feminism often lead to anti feminist backlash which can make the road to equality much more incremental And speaking more generally progress is never a straight line anyway 
Feminism,1615468422,Some Christians find it distasteful to join a religion with the word  Satan in it though and I can respect that 
Feminism,1615497350,Can you expand a bit on what a  gain is  Because strictly speaking I m feeling more comfortable using a fem avatar therefor I m gaining something 
Feminism,1615497282,Thanks for your consideration for my comfort I m gonna be honest I don t understand my reasons either Hypothesis are myriads and I can t discriminate the valuable ones from the others I just empirically know what makes me feel more comfortable What I also know however is that I m comfortable enough being identified as male as to not seek to be identified as something else However you also made me realize that my post was poorly framed How do you feel about this situation in general  Let s say in MMOs for example provided that the avatar isn t unacceptable  gear looking consistent with the task tackled as reasonable body proportions as possible etc 
Feminism,1615497152,I m not sure I understand ti be quite honest and that may just be me not having a decent enough handle on the reality of this But to me its undeniable that women and men face different perils so it stands to reason that there is advice given specifically to women I do understand that there are certain aspects that are needlessly used against women  blaming clothing choices etc   but surely it s agreeable that in order to better equip people with the skills to stay safe it is integral to provide them with the most relevant advice according to their specific situation 
Feminism,1615496526,Nobody s talking about Sue Bird She s played   years and counting for my beloved Seattle Storm and is a sure bet to make the WNBA hall of fame 
Feminism,1615495607,Exactly my sentiment If somebody walks up to me and says  you are either of my opinion or you are wrong and evil i walk away laughing Unless I already hold their view I ll not be any more likely to consider it either There are SO MANY ideological movements that utilize exactly that rhethoric I pass Best way to gain allies is the tiresome long road I fully understand and empathize that many people have done that dozens of times and have grown tired of it Expecting the rest of the unconvinced world to just adapt your view without question because feel like you have arrived at the ultimate truth has historically been a hallmark of a lot of bad ideas so naturally people will probably not be convinced Has anyone here ever had a case where that approach worked anyway 
Feminism,1615495399,So long as you aren t using deception to gain something or hurt someone I don t see the harm 
Feminism,1615495221,Being apathetic and or inactive is favourable to the status quo Those who favour a status quo which in general is sexist are part of the problem Because your  in actions FAVOUR the systematic oppression of women This statement however doesn t apply to all cases equally A large subset of people are politically voiceless or inactive because of their position  usually at the bottom within society these people are not part of the problem and may be victims in various ways to the problem 
Feminism,1615495198,Objectification as we mean it is behavior or thought pattern that opens a door that allows sexual harassment among other things On it s own in a literal sense it is benign Much like the word  scientology implies it is the study of science but is actually the name of a cult like religion and requires critical thinking to fully understand why it s not just  science  study  objectification probably to you sounds like it is  just about treating someone like an object and we re all just objects But it means more than what it sounds like and also requires critical thinking to fully grasp Because we use it in a way that and this is a social norm that MOST people agree on that we are not using the word literally like we don t use the word scientology literally We are talking about it as someone denying our personhood because we are an object not a person instead of what you seem to think it means that we are an object AND a person 
Feminism,1615495132,That s not entirely true IMO I have had many exes guilt me into sexual acts havebyou considered the fact that men feel that they are  less of a man unless they are always ready for sex Making sweeping generalisations about all women is bad regardless of the context 
Feminism,1615494987,there is nothing wrong with giving people of all genders common sense safety advice but the special list of things given  specifically to women to avoid sexual violence is more often than not just used as a way to restrict their freedoms and as a cudgel to beat them over the head with if something does happen the list is endless and always changing when really the only thing victims have in common is bad luck 
Feminism,1615494586,I hate violence against woman but people shouldn t be expected to pick up a pitchfork and torch or else they are a target That is really scary to me 
Feminism,1615494353,I think people only have so much time in the day as well If actively asked are you against DV and educating people in relationships on how to conduct themselves I think most people would say yes    But if you ask people how much of their lives is activism you ll find a majority aren t actively activists I think most people are trying their best with the time they can allocate to help a cause And I think if pressed no one is against these causes  Its just you also have to live your life 
Feminism,1615494247,This exactly There is world of difference between someone who passively discusses these issues with friends and family but doesn t go to protests rallies and internet trolls that claim to be neutral but spout whataboutisms all day 
Feminism,1615493957,I don t know if I m comfortable or uncomfortable with it because I don t really understand your reason behind this I don t need you to explain it to me but it s something you should be absolutely clear about for yourself because it seems like a very important part of understanding yourself  But to properly answer your question As long as you don t do it for any creepy reasons I don t think I would be bothered I would literally only wonder  why   so that question will likely come at you a lot Also depends on the type of avatar of course but I m going with the assumption that it isn t anything freaky Maybe it would be helpful to have a better description of it but given the amount of concern you re voicing I d be highly surprised if it s something unacceptable 
Feminism,1615493759,As you said there are a lot of issues that warrant attention on top of what we need to do to earn money and stay mentally and physically capable to live Like most quotes and tweets it sounds nice in theory I have another one by a German rock band  It s not your fault that the world is like it is but it would be your fault if keeps like this  But in practice all our capacity for certain causes is limited Is it bad to devote only   minutes a day  h    of your income Should that better be spent on poverty reduction Or climate change Is it bad if I go to a climate demonstration but not on a women s march In the end those are only subjective things and there is no objective line between silence and action What we can do is be aware listen to victims and step in when violence or degrading language is used in our vicinity I would even go a step further and say the tweet is actively harmful the words have no objective meaning but they are intended both as a rallying cry for feminists and an insulting challenge for non feminists No one can tell me that it will convince a single person who is not yet a feminist to become one As such the tweet broadens the gap between groups instead of advocating for feminism 
Feminism,1615493601,This I know the injustice women face is bad and I will step in if I wittness people saying dumb sexist shit etc but my active social and political engagement is on different issues that I consider equally or more important to me and humanity in general or where I feel I can be more effective

Feminism,1615493109,For Roe I am everybody says it will be struck down but with a conservative SCOTUS I feel like they will let it slide so the GQP can create their version of Saud Arabia but I am on BC that stops my periods so I am not too worried but I wouldn t be surprised if they go after that next I am planning to save up money to move to New Zealand before the USA becomes Handmaid s Tale but even now that might not happen because they will probably try to take away a woman s right to work as well so I am pretty pessimistic about the future because I don t want children for mental health reasons and I probably would off myself if I did get pregnant and I don t want to do that so if anybody has any old school abortion tips please give them to me because while I am Aroace I know I could still possibly be raped Basically I am terrified as a young woman with a learning disability of what will happen if these Christo Fascists get their way so much that I don t trust anyone who aligns as conservative 
Feminism,1615493085,Yeah I mean I have no problem with the fact that conventionally unattractive people can t get on TV It s a visual medium that unfortunately just goes with the territory The issue I have is the sexism men and women should be roughly the same on average in terms of attractiveness  unless there is a very good narrative reason for this not being the case  
Feminism,1615493053,Got it I ll avoid it in the future This is my first day on this sub and I m used to arguing w nazis normally so I don t usually think abt it
Feminism,1615492780,I think Kali pretty much sums it up but I d also like to add that a very common excuse is misinformation or being simply unaware The thing about social issues is that you have to   choose  to be aware of them it s not so much that ignorance has and must be considered willful all the time but rather if we choose to give ignorance the power to excuse itself from being involved in social issues then literally NOTHING can be done because anyone can feign ignorance In other words someone ignorant to sexism might as well be complicit 
Feminism,1615492477,Well sure  everyone knows that violence against women is a problem What I meant was that people may not know the details  the extent to which it s a problem its pervasive presence in all forms of entertainment ways that they can get involved to reduce it etc Violence against women is so common in TV video games etc that a lot of people have just become accustomed to it They need to be educated and either or statements can be alienating to those people  My issue is only with the argument she used not with the cause itself 
Feminism,1615492167, gt a lot of people are simply ignorant about the extent and details of the issue At this point though you have to be  trying to be unaware of these kinds of things 
Feminism,1615492014,I have a fair amount of experience with healthcare both as a patient and a medical student The most helpful thing in my opinion is being very clear about your concerns and if a doctor doesn t take them seriously escalating  Making a list of issues is a good idea for any appointment If you go into it with a clear idea of what needs to be addressed it s harder for someone to brush you aside A good doctor will ask if you have any concerns that haven t been addressed but because many doctors are rushed it s something that gets skipped often Unfortunately the onus is often on the patient to bring up their concerns Another important thing to keep in mind is to not be afraid to get a second opinion or to complain about poor quality care Here in the UK hospitals have a patient advice and liaison service  PALS who you can talk to if you re dissatisfied with your care They can help advocate for you or help you file a formal complaint I ve spoken with them twice once after having appalling treatment by paramedics and another time when I wanted to file a complaint against my psychiatrist They are very helpful Another thing don t be afraid to change doctors Sometimes you won t have a good rapport with a given doctor It happens Changing doctors is okay They shouldn t take offense to it 
Feminism,1615491983,I don t like  either you re with us or against us statements generally It s extremely divisive and it doesn t invite curious inquiry It also ignores the fact that a lot of people are simply ignorant about the extent and details of the issue Being uninformed doesn t mean that you re maliciously refusing to take up Jamil s cause but that s what I hear her imply in her quoted statement I also find an element of self righteous gatekeeping in these types of statements too They just turn me off entirely 
Feminism,1615491691,Yeah idk maybe we mean the same thing here maybe we don t so I ll just explain what I ve seen from experience Maybe that helps    I don t really think  women as an entire demographic is the thing to focus on I am in a year with    female students Most of them being white and from rich backgrounds Those are not interested in changing the very thing that guaranteed them a spot And a lot of them have a strained relationship with feminism  at best  plenty are happy to support anti feminist views because   privilege  So   what would actually help a lot more than simply having any women at all is trying to remove barriers and have more BIPOC women more queer folks more folks with disabilities and so on The more diverse a student body is the more the curriculum will have to change to acknowledge different needs  hopefully  Because in the current environment privileged women thrive the same way men do and don t speak up to change things 
Feminism,1615490954,I think having women in medschool will change things But in my assumption I do not think women will be a passive presence therein Women will and must use their voice when in medschool and in medicine  I could have made that clearer 
Feminism,1615490833,If you truly care about ending violence you will care enough to try and prevent it from happening in the future not just prevent it from happening in front of you

Feminism,1615490671,That s exactly why feminism is not succeeding it s why egalitarians are not joining and why men won t have anything to do with it  also most women don t identify themselves as feminist in the west It s cause of people like you and the amusing part is you don t even realize that
Feminism,1615490661,I m sorry I m ESL And to me that initial thing sounded very much like  having women in medschool will change things  
Feminism,1615490576,I understand and agree with everything you are saying In the short term I said all you can do is refuse to go unheard   So I am not sure why you are reading me or into that as advocating for  just waiting   The demand to be heard is the basis for a lot of civil rights movments including feminist ones  But in this I do not dispute anything you are saying I am just confused by the way you are insisting on reading me 
Feminism,1615490420,I try to see female doctors wherever possible I find that they are generally more willing to explore any complaints I have to try and get to the bottom of them 
Feminism,1615490314,In my house we joke about it   Daughter comes out with short shorts on  Me How is that I have failed so badly as a mother that I have not instilled the appropriate amount of crippling body shame in you yet Kid laughs I laugh She knows where the lines are and how to manage them well enough She knows where the danger is Now I d only bring it up if she s going into a new environment  eg going to a concert where older drunk men will be  
Feminism,1615490270, gt doctors HAVE to treat you immediately when you re in pain They can t send you away ah that must be nice
Feminism,1615490124,Yes sexist doctors consider you to be dramatic But I m also loud and annoying and they can t just ignore the ruckus like they can a silent sufferer Several doctors told me that women tend to become really calm and focused in reality which is often interpreted as  not so serious  because men complain quite much in comparison It was one of them who told me to act up more I m still not very dramatic though  Where I live doctors HAVE to treat you immediately when you re in pain They can t send you away without relieve and I always remind myself of that 
Feminism,1615489875,A change over a few decades doesn t really solve anything tho Like sure I m glad in    y people will probably have better healthcare but   women right now are still being sent home on anxiety meds when they really have pneumonia or a heart attack  And the thing is women simply existing in a space really doesn t change a lot Especially when all the rules are still made by men and it s a huge boys club where you are told you should be grateful to have a seat at the table at all I am not saying change is impossible  I am currently working to strike stuff from the curriculum at my university  but women simply signing up doesn t do anything There would have to be a radical overhaul of curricula and teaching practices And I don t see that happening with most medschools leaning white rich and conservative where I am It s definitely not gonna happen by just   waiting Not with such high barriers to even get a spot  I d like to put it out there tho that I m literally doing feminist activism at a medical university btw My point isn t that change is impossible But it ll require an insane amount of work and basically rethinking any program that s currently taught in medschool Bc they all have plenty of bias 
Feminism,1615489736, This century So you got this Lifting the ban on women in combat        I d absolutely agree that s a good thing but it should also be a requirement to sign in for the draft hopefully we can get that done in the next   years Maintaining the existence of Planned Parenthood  ongoing I m personally a fan of aborting unborn children but let s not forget depending on the study it s pretty much    of people are pro and    against abortions so I wouldn t necessarily call that a big win  MeToo            I d say the meetoo movement hurt more people than helped wrong accusations and made up stories destroyed the legitimacy of real victims and it absolutely backfired it s less likely people will believe the victim of sexual assault today than it was back in      or    
Feminism,1615489402, gt pretending to be extra sick Doesn t this perpetuate the stereotype that women are being dramatic or exaggerating when they have a health complaint 
Feminism,1615489292,I am not sure you read long term correctly If you are suggesting that this status quo is inevitable and demographic shifts and new perspectives will in the long term amount to nothing   Well I disagree Over the last hundred years a lot has changed Over the next hundred years a lot more will and can change  How things are is not immutable and in the long term it will change And demographic shifts and the demand for recognition will continue to push things along None of this long term stuff requires women  in general to be immune to anything  Women fought against women getting the right to vote And the idea of women not voting was  hard in how people thought   Still it changed So your statement of how hard it is or will be doesn t mean on the long term things will not change 
Feminism,1615489173,I don t think it s bad to ask in general It s true that dangerous people would say all those things Which is a factor in why a woman might say no Obviously since you re asking this out of genuine concern Im gonna assume you re not dangerous But the person you re asking probably won t know that So If you re polite about it and she says  No thank you  Just wish her well and part ways
Feminism,1615489132,Yes you are part of the problem because social correction is essential to form a society If you don t step in you signal the perpetrators as well as the victims that what happens is justified and ok These things happen all the time and no one gets punished often to the contrary get cheered on because people who believe to be on right side shut up Women can t avoid it so you can t either 
Feminism,1615489119, gt you not mentioning men tells more about your opinion on feminism than the rest What does this mean Is your complaint that a movement for women s issues doesn t focus more on men 
Feminism,1615489002,I agree     on principle Where it gets hard for me is the vast amount of suffering in the world Domestic violence Poverty Failures of the education system Pollution Unaffordable healthcare Race and all the MANY ways it shows up strucutally Environmental degradation and climate change Transportation infrastructure equity issues Corruption erosion of democracy and solid journalism I could go on   I work really hard to be a good person but I couldn t possibly be deeply informed on all these issues take meaningful action on everything  It s not for lack of trying   Judging a whole person s character based on whether they take the exact steps you think they should is alienating of potential allies  If you know someone s heart is in the right place inviting them to join you  donate march volunteer speak up etc seems more effective to me Even if they only were meaningfully active in their local school board I wouldn t write them off To me any work towards their work greater good is the standard to meet 
Feminism,1615488839,That s the problem my mom is having right now She suspects that one of her symptoms is tied to something with her reproductive system and wanted to clear it with her doctor but the dude just won t listen She s trying to see a specialist now so it s good to know that someone else has had some success with doing their research beforehand 
Feminism,1615488704, you not mentioning men tells more about your opinion on feminism than the rest You wouldn t touch that guy with a stick  and you know that  You are making it way too easy with this  feminism can t be criticized by definition shtick
Feminism,1615488697,Haha I didn t even know you could review doctors on google This is game changing
Feminism,1615488625,I have noticed that as well I do think that TV movies in the United States are getting better as far as that is concerned though as well as more actresses around middle age are showing up in major TV and movie roles 
Feminism,1615488586,Marital rape literally wasn t a crime until the    s The fact that feminism hasn t solved all the worlds issues yet doesn t mean it isn t a good thing 
Feminism,1615488469,I ve recently started to have more success in getting doctors to listen to me and it s a bunch of garbage bullshit that no one should have to do and I only have to do it because of patriarchy and fatphobia  BUT that being said I do have a couple things that I ve found really really helpful  amp  x   B For one I ve tried not to catch my doctors off guard about any of my questions  Especially when you re dealing with chronic conditions or weird symptoms it s impossible for the doctor to know off the top of their head what is causing it  And a lot of those things feasibly  could be caused by anxiety or stress or weight or whatever and if you catch them off guard with it saying it s probably one of those things significantly simplifies their job and it s really tempting to do So what I do is the day before any doctor s appointment I either use the online patient portal or the telephone to reach out to the office and say  Hey I m looking forward to my appointment with Dr So And So tomorrow  Can we put a note in my file to make sure to leave some time to talk about specific medical problem  It s really been concerning me lately   Then your doctor knows it s not just an offhand concern it s really bothering you and they ll be able to come in prepared with some more nuanced less under pressure thoughts for what it might be  amp  x   B Another thing that s been really helpful for me is to be completely     respectfully behind whatever my doctor thinks the problem is and be willing to take whatever actions they want me to take but to make sure that I continue asking follow up questions to be sure that my problem won t be swept under the rug So you say things like  OK I ll definitely try to lose some weight to help my knee get better  Are there any signs I should look out for that indicate that it s getting worse or might be caused by something else  Do you think it would be beneficial for me to see a nutritionist to aid in weight loss  At what weight would you be concerned that my knee had some kind of problem other than weight  If it s still like this after  months should I check back with you  Give the impression that you re     down with the plan of  try your idea first   But make sure that that s being treated as a testable hypothesis with a specific instruction for  Do X  If it doesn t work in the next  months call me and we ll try something else   amp  x   B And if your doctor does even the bare minimum of listing to you and addressing your concerns without shuffling you out of the room go on google and write them a GLOWING review where you specifically mention how well they listen to your concerns when so many doctors don t listen to women  They will listen to you   times harder next time 
Feminism,1615488207,Sadly having more female students doesn t help Our education is racist and sexist and you ll find less women the  higher you go up the hierarchy So those who dictate treatment guidelines for hospitals and influence how patients are treated on an individual basis will probably be overwhelmingly male for a while regardless of student populations  Female doctors and medstudents aren t immune to bias Not even bias against their own gender And medschool drives those points home  hard  
Feminism,1615488182,Don t tell demonstrate A  neutral conversation allows doctors to ignore you acting it a little out makes them compassionate It sounds silly but I got the best results by pretending to be extra sick and complaining like my life depends on it 
Feminism,1615487993,I ll go with German writer Erich K stner on this one  All mischief that happens isn t only the fault of those who do it but also the fault of those who do not prevent it  Preventing it can look like actively stepping in But it can also be just educating others and being vocal about opposing something If you stand by while people are experiencing violence it doesn t phase you enough to care So yes if you ask me staying silent is condoning it Where exactly I d draw the line of  doing enough I can t say But if you do nothing at all you re complicit 
Feminism,1615487699,You seem to be very confused about what feminism is and what it s saying in the first place 
Feminism,1615487547, If you are neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppressor If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality  
Feminism,1615487406,In this  century  Okay The right to vote       The pill        the right for married women to obtain contraception        and the right for unmarried women to obtain contraception       The Violence Against Women Act       Marital rape declared a crime       Title VII which bans employment discrimination based on sex       Title IX       Roe v Wade       Lifting the ban on women in combat       Maintaining the existence of Planned Parenthood  ongoing Bringing attention to  date rape            MeToo            those are pretty major wouldn t you say 
Feminism,1615487371,Are you referring to women who have encountered problems related to how others have treated them based on their bodies or gender 
Feminism,1615486792,Give me ONE think in this century in let s say America
Feminism,1615486562, femminists by definition cannot be misandrists yeah there are jokes about being misandrists that some feminists make  I even know a man  w a  misandry now t shirt but by definition feminists cannot be misandrists And TERFs aren t real feminists either Feminism is for all women and trans women are women and are born  mentally as women TERFs also tend to be racist and antisemitic too so again they cannot be feminists either 
Feminism,1615486238,I wont deny that in the current day too much activism consists of sensationalism and virtue signaling This goes for all groups There are some flaws in the modern feminist movement sure Though at the end of the day you can t deny feminism has done exponentially  more good for the world than MRA s ever had 
Feminism,1615486173,I watch them with fascination I only know a few And even years later I m flabbergasted when they pull out a vacuum or know who the pediatrician is They re like goddamned unicorns 
Feminism,1615485836,I disagree but that s not that important the point is   current feminist groups are pretty terrible          blaming the patriarchy for their problems instead of solving anything  see what I did there  
Feminism,1615485116,You said nobody hates feminism but most people like equality and now you re saying there s a lot to hate about feminism and that s why they re having such a hard time achieving their goals Which is it 
Feminism,1615484921,And that s why feminism has such a hard time achieving equality that s the point   bud
Feminism,1615484680,After some bad experiences what I have done is I make a list of concerns questions before I go in  particularly if I m seeing a new doctor   and I m very annoying about not leaving until I get them all answered The other thing I do  which I know doctors hate but I have had too many just straight up blow me off  is do a little bit of research re the diagnostic testing needed for what I suspect might be the issue I then tell the doctor about my symptoms and if they don t recommend following the diagnostic protocol I ask them too If a doctor refuses to take me seriously after that I change doctors I have had problems with both women and men doctors  typically though you ll have better luck being listened too at a smaller practice rather than someone operating out of a large hospital and with a DO rather than an MD  Other than that  just be prepared emotionally and psychologically to be persistent 
Feminism,1615484621,Current MRA groups are pretty terrible That s not to say their can t be effective men s rights groups but most of the current ones seem more intent on blaming feminists for their problems instead of solving anything I would say that in order to achieve full equality both men and women need to break free from the current coerced hierarchy related to sex but I don t think MRA s will play any meaningful role in that 
Feminism,1615484558,In the long term the demographic shift underway in medicine that is seeing more women entering into and graduating with degrees in medicine is probably the best bet In the short term basically refusing to be ignored is all I can think to say 
Feminism,1615484482,Please use the search bar side bar wiki for this frequently asked question 
Feminism,1615484019,Can t argue that I m sure people like that exist it s just there s a difference between the movement and it s representatives   Like you d agree that a terf isn t exactly who you d want to be associated with  For someone looking at the movement from the outside   how should they know not everyone is the same  there s a lot to hate about feminism just like other groups like mgtow or MRA or whatever 
Feminism,1615483728,So is it bad to ask in general I was told this by another person in the comments  Dangerous people would also say all those things so that doesn t really help But when you offer to walk her home it s nice to make clear somehow that her refusing is an option and not a big deal to you like um  Hey it s late do you want me to walk you home If you prefer to go by yourself that s fine too     Does that work here under the advice you have given me Or is it better not to ask if they simply didn t ask me themselves 
Feminism,1615483324,Do you feel similarly about the pride thing White or male pride almost seem to be exclusively seen as racist or sexist while any other combination other than white or male seem acceptable 
Feminism,1615483156, gt nobody hates feminism oh my goodness I regret to inform you that you are extremely wrong about this as a person who mods a feminism sub A LOT OF PEOPLE HATE FEMINISM AND FEMINISTS 
Feminism,1615483073,Absolutely not nobody hates feminism some people hate some feminists  like feminists that are misandrist or trans exclusionary while the egitarian movement doesn t necessarily exist more people believe in egality than feminism cause of the unlikable loud minority
Feminism,1615482476,Ask but take no for an answer I will never fault a man for asking but I have had experiences where men just insist that they should it s not safe etc which is sexist and patronizing

Feminism,1615482136,That s absolutely the point I tried to make thank you for wording it better  English is not my first language 
Feminism,1615480960,When I was in my   s I    f realized that men were probably more likely to be involved in a violent incident at night  But I was repeatedly told to  not go out alone   All the time  By a wide range of people It pissed me off  It felt like society was using some sort of mystery boogey man to control me and keep me docile and at home  When the truth is my greatest risk of sexual assault is from men I have some sort of relationship with So I started going out alone  Walking around town late at night  Traveling Hiking You name it if I want to do it I will do am honest risk assessment and go do it    I am aware that there are risks to solo activities and sometimes the reward is not worth the risk After   years and multiple cities in North America and Europe  stranger put his arm around me another  masturbated in front of me  But guys I know have committed sexual assault sexual coercion unwanted physical contact   various things  at the end I feel safer among strangers out in the open where I can separate myself than in an enclosed space with casual acquaintances 
Feminism,1615480671,Ever been mugged Because I have twice The second time they didn t even ask for anything They just knocked me down and beat the living shit out of me before even trying to take anything I was off work for two months Know what literally everyone  the cops the doctors my friends my family my wife  said to me constantly  What were you thinking walking alone that late How drunk were you Well what did you  expect   The idea that no one blames men for their own victimization is a complete myth The experience is absolutely not unique to women 
Feminism,1615480643,I think it s important to remember that victims of violent crimes that were reported to the police of both genders are a very small minority of the population  It s a very small number of people who are like  this happened to me or I saw it happened to someone else and now I am scared   That s not the primary driver for feelings of safety or lack of safety The primary driver for people s feelings of lack of safety are their actual experiences  And I think that women are overwhelmingly more likely than men to encounter non violent threats outside the home unrelated to their own behavior  If someone catcalls you if someone follows you home but doesn t actually hurt you if someone whispers something sexual in your ear on a train often even if you re groped in passing  Those things almost never get reported to police and especially they don t count as  violent crimes   And most women have had an experience with something like that in places that most people would consider  safe   They ve had a male stranger follow them or make uncomfortable advances towards them in a coffee shop on a crowded train in a well lit bar in the supermarket at the gym walking down a busy main road in broad daylight  These smaller scary ways that men victimize women happen in places that are supposed to be safe and they happen to almost all women at some point in their lives In my experience men and women both feel fear when parking in a dark alleyway far from the bar when walking alone in the woods when passing a shady looking character on the street  But I think that women more than men are frequently reminded that even places that are normal and safe can be very dangerous to women  That guy who followed you in the mall could follow you into the parking garage and murder you and even if he didn t you always know that he could have  amp  x   B Also a nonzero percentage of the male number can be attributed to perpetrators of violence being more likely to be victims of violence and a majority of perpetrators of violence are male  So like if  dudes start fighting eachother in a bar with no women in it that s  men who are victims of a violent assault  I think in general non perpetrator men are still more at risk for violence outside the home but it does inflate those numbers a little 
Feminism,1615480622,Men can put up a fight this gives us a lot of peace of mind But being a woman at the mercy of half the population which by and large lusts for you Wouldn t you be scared 
Feminism,1615480389, gt Okay so it s not inherently sexist to want to It s not inherently but it  can be sexist  It ultimately depends on  why you want to and how equal you are in your desire to help women who may benefit from your help vs other people that may need your help 
Feminism,1615479955,Most muggings occur at night and fewer women are out at night in the first place 
Feminism,1615479927,Your stats is flawed As other comment pointed out women are more likely to not go outside at all in fear of being assaulted Also men participate in violence at greater numbers than women so consequently they suffer more from this violence  You should compare pure numbers of men and women going outside and how they are assaulted and harassed Funny how you didn t include the latter in your stats because even if women aren t assaulted they are catcalled and creeped on by men which is intimidating already A threat of assault is always there even if it doesn t necessarily result in assault 
Feminism,1615508629,It is a great quote but I don t think it applies as well to those who are in charge of selection of candidates as well as it does to the voting by the general populace If those selecting candidates don t try to find someone a bit better than the best old white guy from a stack of mostly old white guys things are not going to improve They bear more responsibility for the candidates 
Feminism,1615507735,But you assumed I wasn t a feminist by asking that question and saying that You see that right 
Feminism,1615507591,Did you know that there s been an epidemic in the United States of Native American women going missing or becoming victims of homicide In     alone over      Indigenous women went missing   How many of their names  stories do you know  How many of those women even made it to the local news let alone the national news 
Feminism,1615507229,I do think media in general focus more on white people And white women s tears are really alluring to the media like a moth to a flame  However I think this case in particular seems to be one of those where the circumstances or even just the timing is propitious to become viral I ll be more than happy to see the tweets you saw to read what POC s think about this particular case  I myself do not think I m a white woman per se however  I don t think I have a say on women of color s opinions It s difficult for me to know my  place  
Feminism,1615507036,Every person regardless of gender has a moral obligation to intervene when they see injustice occurring I m not a man I m physically fairly weak and I m someone who has their share of trauma around issues of violence I ve also intervened in a number of situations where my physical safety was at risk in doing so because intervening could help prevent someone from being seriously injured I do not think this behavior is exceptional or that it s unreasonable to expect people to intervene Just as many high schools require CPR public education should cover bystander intervention 
Feminism,1615506754,You didn t ask anyone else this question but you asked me Fine I ll assume you were just genuinely asking    How old are you And it seems you re very keen to insult me anyways As if you re looking for an excuse Be my guest It s unproductive but it s a free country insult me if you want I m not gonna be a baby about it

Feminism,1615505741,That s not what I said   It has nothing to do with your gender it has to do with your understanding of feminism Keep arguing with me though 
Feminism,1615505410,I don t think the majority of men who are  neutral have much interest in feminism especially if they have never looked into it There s plenty of feminist who talk about the ways it helps men Do you think white people are put off dealing with racism by the protests at some point to get real change there s going to be uncomfortable things that happen and uncomfortable discussions What if talking about male privilege puts them off can we not have those discussions then It sounds like the same attitude given to gay people who wanted marriage  don t ask for too much it s not the right time to treat you guys as equal yet it s never the right time Progress usually comes with backlash  Women get angry over our lifetime of oppression but I ve only seen the  everyday is men s day in response to men s sarcastic response to women s day Those kinds of men aren t interest in being nice or converting to feminism 
Feminism,1615504794,You sound like you care about being a good person and a good friend  I don t know if you can help your friends but you can help yourself  A counselor can help give you tools to reduce remove intrusive thoughts  ones you don t want and negative thoughts  I didn t want to go too far and say low self esteem but a few things you said made me wonder   And for the record that teacher IS a jerk It doesn t help anyone to put people down 
Feminism,1615504389,Here s my problems with it   She s wrong that Disney didn t show things like the monarchy being overthrown in Aladdin and Dumbo being remade to be about how racism is evil because they are afraid of people turning against oppressive systems that they benifit from The reason why they did this is because they are adapting pre existing stories and adding these things would not have made sense within the context of the story whatsoever    Why can t a fantasy world in which good capitalists or good rich people exist They don t exist in the real world but this isn t the real world   She seems to be less bothered by this stuff in the originals due to nostalgia   She s wrong that representation in itself isn t progressive

Feminism,1615501561,I disagree with the text you quoted If you are an oppressed minority other than a woman your first priority is to your own struggle cause As long as you are being oppressed you owe other oppressed groups nothing Your strength and energy should rightly go to your own struggle first and foremost It is either a case of white privilege cis oppression or ableism if other groups demand to siphon off your energy to their own cause while you are struggling with your own discrimination and abuse This seems like the idea of some privileged white feminists who want to coop the energy of other oppressed minorities and flip it over to feminist cause I find it a really sketchy and underhanded tactic

Feminism,1615501106,You are correct Women are thought they should be on tv because of how pretty they are That is first Acting ability comes second And there are so many guys on tv that if you met them on the street you would never look at them twice much less want them to look at you Vince Vaughn comes to mind Not exactly attractive overweight looks like your typical loser dude on the sofa and he doesn t even act that well Everything I ve seen him in is just about the same char But they pair him up with Jennifer Aniston who can act has a slim body and is gorgeous He should be paired up with Rosanne  people on the same attractiveness side not ugly but not Jennifer Aniston   But there are a lot of those pairings It s also harder to relate to women onscreen if somewhere in the back of your mind your thinking they are perfect it makes it a little harder to sympathize One of my favorite shows is on BBC The Split Nicola Walker plays a lawyer She is brilliant I always feel lucky to be able to watch it with her because she  would never be allowed on us tv She doesn t look like a supermodel and she make me  think of how many other actresses that would make a show a standout because of their acting ability  but aren t allowed because their attractiveness level is only that of Vaughn To be honest I think she is more attractive than him but she would never be on US tv

Feminism,1615500795,I understand where the confusion comes from especially because blanket statements like  if you re not with us by definition you re against us are not very open minded I think what she means though is if as a man you talk about how women deserve rights but when women accuse others of rape assault when they march for rights if no men step up to speak in support they re not really doing much They can say all they want about women s rights but how many men have stepped up in support of Evan Rachel Wood of Rose McGowan of all the women who scream that they ve suffered violence It s always the women The men stand back like they re just letting women do their thing But they have to raise their voice too Call out men who abuse You don t need to witness it to interrupt the violence Simply believe women fervently and use your privileged cishetero platform to call out the violence and demand justice Like male celebs need to be at MeToo marches and events at TimesUp events If Charisma comes out to denounce the monster Whedon David Boreanaz and Nicholas Brendon need to do more than say oh that s so sad I m sorry They should demand they deplatform Whedon Brendon s oh he s my friend is bullshit Help women fight the violence or admit you re just pretending to believe women They can t have their cake and eat it too Men are so bro ey in that They respect other men so hard that they can t respect women more and support them           and yell it from the rooftops The time has come and gone for women to be apologetic of men as bystanders They either do it or they don t Notice how quick women are to defend and believe women they ve never met Men don t do that They only give their two cents when it s a friend If that I wanna hear Hugh Jackman Martin Scorsese Chris Pine I want all these men with large platforms to come out and say I believe her and I support her They have nothing to lose They re men The most privileged bunch But they don t It becomes a oh no comment I don t know the story The same turning of heads when they see a drunk guy at a bar force himself on a woman or yell at his girlfriend It s like there s a written code to be loyal to each other It s stupid and we shouldn t let these men just get away with it 
Feminism,1615500788,Oh you re spot on with that They aren t inherently safer it s more like an admittedly biased brain filtering mechanism You filter people based on trustworthiness and a man playing as a woman automatically gets a  deception point added to his list even if it s obvious that he is a man But I personally feel much safer around women so not everyone will weigh the same to that point as I do And of course personal experiences See the reason I said I realized I feel safer watching a stream is that I would feel like I would get a better glimpse into the person playing and by that find safety in knowing the person s motivations to the degree that is perceivable over it in the first place Commentary adds a lot to that  That being said it would be really great to see someone break through all this negativity Show them how it s done without toxic masculinity 
Feminism,1615500738,They aren t I had women get violent with me when I refuse them   Which is weird because women can get it somewhere else fairly easy I had several women force themselves on me and wouldn t take no for an answer My first time I was drunk and practically  passed out and the woman forced herself on me One diffrence with guys is we don t make a deal out of it since it doesn t effect us emotionally and its not painful but I mean I was way to out of it to consent and honestly didn t want to Technically it was rape I didn t realize that untill years later It doesn t bother me just kinda wish my first time wasn t with some rando from a bar and a nite I barely remember

Feminism,1615500677,The actual existence of physical violence is the highest escalation provising the biggest impulse to intervene If someone is afraid to intervene someone grabbing a girl s ass because he might end in the hospital do you think he would be more willing to risk his physical wellbeing if the women  just got catcalled I don t think that s a fair argument on your end to make Also as I explained people may have different resources Sure if you can afford to help someone in distress you should     do it But for many people it may not be an option Is it lack of character that a     guy doesn t want to intervene catcalling from a group of drunk and possibly aggressive guys Wh should he be risking his physical health for a stranger Where does this obligation come from He can call the police and that s all you should expect from him Do you think otherwise And if so why is that If you would go to hospital or lose your job to help someone you maybe don t even know you are a better human than most people 
Feminism,1615500536,Ahah well full disclosure here When I was like    playing Guild Wars   my dad asked me why I was playing as a woman with a smug expression on his face That s pretty much what I answered him and had been answering since until some years ago when I got educated and educated myself further on feminism and started deconstructing dumb toxic shit Seems like we re going full circle On the other hand tho I m afraid they might have a point Maybe the experienced comfort is just gratification in misogynistic objectification and visual stimuli That s an hypothesis I m fairly afraid of I wouldn t like myself very much in that case

Feminism,1615500367,There is nothing wrong with teaching our young people risk mitigation strategies and situational awareness What  women have been objecting to is different  Women are given advice that a assumes we don t already know and practice these strategies and b asks us to go beyond these strategies in ways that unreasonably restricts our ability to participate in public life It is also advice that is not given to men  We should remember that many women  especially if they are poor can t avoid going out alone even if we wanted to or would have to make extraordinary sacrifices to do so  Let s also remember that given women are actually at higher risk from men known to them the commonly suggested strategy of  ask a male friend to walk you home is probably more dangerous than walking home alone

Feminism,1615499913,How do you actively end violence other than not participating or condoning it I don t see how society as a whole will end violence The world is violent in genera I even read a study that claimed the human body is designed for violence Violence is caused by so many factors its virtually impossible to end That would also mean ending mental illness and basic human nature in fact nature is violent even plants are violent We can preach don t hit women until our throats bleed but that won t stop every psychopath from doing it Furthermore violence can be circumstantial a perfectly nice guy and general may strike a woman in a blind rage or because he s drunk In the western world violence in general against anyone is shunned but it still happens and will probably always happen as sure as water is wet This same theory applies to  teach men not to rape Every man knows he shouldn t  rape no one needs to be taught that Things that you don t want done to you people know they shouldn t do to others But some people don t care

Feminism,1615499665,Are you qualified to teach adult women how to protect themselves Do you not think we already know how The outrage over the Sarah Everard situation is that she did everything right She did all she could to protect herself and was still murdered It isn t that no women should do what they can to avoid danger it s that most women already do what they can and are still killed The issue is women have and are still being made to change what they do to accomodate for the actions of murderers and rapists Like when the yorkshire ripper was about and women were put under a curfew Would it not have made more sense to put men under a curfew since then any men out and about could be classed as suspects Obvious y it s not an identical situation but you get my point  Women do and will continue to do everything they can to protect themselves and nothing you say will change that Instead do us a favour and make sure other men in your life arent harrassing raping or murdering women 
Feminism,1615499582,It seems to me too impractical If we lived in some utopian society where discrimination or violence are are few and far between having an active position against every instances of marginalisation would be in everyone s physical or mental capacity but our world is far too cruel to allow that  Everyday we are passing through constant stream of news that never stop to report about injustices around the world Every case is deserving full public attention but not everyone has ability or time to provide it It is inevitable that there would be a need to prioritize some events over others and I don t know any other method to do so other than leaving it on our own personnel choice Nobody should decide for anyone what problems in society are more important  if you agree with all of that  you must also consider that there would be people who would who while not supporting current state of affairs still not do anything about it Edit misspelled
Feminism,1615499439,I wonder in which way you should expect men individually to step in on such occasions I hope we can have a meaningful discussion on this so let me elaborate Let me first start by the premise of abolishing toxic gender roles One of which would be the male as the strong protector of the weak female Women are strong and need no men to protect them So there is no obligation to stop violence because they are men On the other hand men might also face consequences if they intervene in certain violent situations These consequences may be social or physical Which highly depends on the social area the violence is happening For example A man has a job he needs for his survival He sees his boss molest one of his female colleagues And while the colleague is afraid to stop her boss because she might lose her job you could say the same about the man bearing witness to the horrible behavior A man in the Disco watching someone grab a women s butt This is obviously and clearly sexual violence While the women might be afraid to defend herself due to clear physical threat the man witnessing can feel the same way Intervention might lead to himself ending up in the hospital for someone he doesn t even know In conclusion in certain situation men might not have the resources to actively intervene a violent situation May it be financially socially or physically Expecting those men to risk their health financial stability or social standing in some cases for someone they don t know may be a lot to ask This said if you have the resources to intervene a case of violence you should obviously do it No matter the attacker or victim of this violence But I think it s important to have a bit of nuance here 
Feminism,1615499203,This is not a bad unwelcome comment but we do have a  top level rule   here that requires all users replying directly to posts to be feminists I am not sure that is the case with you so I d ask that you relegate your participation to nested comments 
Feminism,1615499171,My concern with this type of sentiment is that some people will judge your efforts not to be enough or not matching their efforts and therefore you fall in with the oppressor I ve learned it takes all kinds and different people have different strengths The writer may not be an eloquent public speaker The person who works behind the scenes may not be comfortable protesting in a crowd The person that trys to educate on an individual basis because they connect better that way may not have things posted on social media And the movement leader from a year ago may now be battling cancer and no longer has the energy to devote to a cause  If we can take our personal judgements out of the equation and instead open the door for all types of support we may see a larger group It also gives some people an opportunity to learn other ways of support

Feminism,1615498317,I am a female physician working in the ER I think something we as physicians aren t always good at is reconciling patient priorities with our priorities I have a few things to recommend to patients to help reframe the  we are a team approach to their own symptoms Spoiler alert  the final step is to find a new GP if you still aren t feeling listened to  First off book an appointment to specifically address the symptoms that aren t being attended to Don t try to tag them onto an appointment about your other health issues The latter may result in you being blown off as time often limits most GP appointments to ten minutes If your GP is really focused on your heart health they may not have time to address say more chronic symptoms such as fatigue or pain or weight loss etc  Be upfront with specific concerns in that appointment don t leave them to the end Usually we open with an open question like  what brings you in today  Reply with something like  I was hoping to ask some questions related to my  lt symptom gt  as I feel as though I don t fully understand my management plan for it   If you have something in particular you are worried about be upfront about that too  Doctor I keep getting frightened that this pain may be cancer Is that something you are concerned about too or have we ruled that out already  If we haven t ruled that out  Would we be able to do some tests for that for peace of mind or can you explain to me why that isn t on your list of possibilities  The answer to  can I get more tests may still be  no depending on what your concern or question is For example if you are requesting full body MRI to rule out every possible cause of cancer that isn t a feasible workup But if you re having pelvic pain or bleeding  I saw in your comment the concern was the reproductive system  and wonder if there could be a problem there a pelvic ultrasound or endometrial biopsy is a reasonable and easy thing to arrange for  As someone else suggested if your management plan still seems like you re being blown off you have a few options First you can say something like  okay so the best step now is to give it some more time to see if it settles It has already been a problem for  lt days weeks months whatever gt  When should I come back in if it fails to settle down to go forward with the next step What is the next step  You can also ask for a referral  If it doesn t settle down would I be able to discuss this further with a specialist If there s a long waitlist could we put that referral in today so the follow up is in place  If all else fails  Would I be able to talk about this with one of the other Doctors in your practice to get a second opinion I m really worried about it  And finally you can  fire your doctor and call around for a new one if you re still being blown off  I don t recommend exaggerating your symptoms as someone else here commented If symptoms are exaggerated  so a chronic symptom is being stated as severe or more acute or in a larger distribution  it can change the differential diagnosis So you may end up with a work up that is inappropriate for your presenting complaint  Honesty is the best policy Sometimes it does take several visits and a step wise approach to get a diagnosis and this is normal and reasonable  Consider attending the appointment with your mom if she is having trouble explaining these things or isn t being listened to If all else fails find a new provider Attending medical school doesn t make us all good people or infallible and sometimes you just have a bad egg as a PCP

Feminism,1615532992,I agree with what you re saying I think a scary thought is that perhaps a big reason why public violence is so low for women is because they re not in public and not in the way of opportunistic violence as much as men are 
Feminism,1615532563,I do think there are good points made here and many elements of modern culture that teach women and girls that they should be afraid to exist publicly in the world but tolerant of and obedient to authority figures and family members  are rooted in sexist traditions often with a splash of racism and victim blaming for good measure  That said I d be hesitaant come to the conclusion that it s  all an overblown phenomenon For instance there are plenty of ways women can be made to feel uniquely uncomfortable alone in public spaces that might fall short of actually constituting violent crime but still contribute to a general feeling of hostility or danger that can leave a lasting impression  Also not all crime is necessarily cut from the same cloth even if men are more likely than women to be the victims of violent crime in general women could still be more likely to be the victim of  gendered violence   that is crime committed not out of opportunism but specifically on the basis of the victim s sex with rape and sexual assault being some obvious examples That kind of disproportionality can  rightly make a person feel less safe even if the absolute numbers are still lower

Feminism,1615557593,How I feel about this I m deeply sad that it s necessary but so appreciate the option Like many women I ve been harassed at the gym by men A lot As a result I m not very comfortable working out around men I m glad I have an option for working out that allows me to avoid this situation altogether The entire issue could be better mitigated if gyms would just protect their clientele from harassment but they generally choose not to do so And honestly a man simply staring and watching my every move ruins my workouts because it s creepy and weird AF but no normal gym will kick them out for it  I visit less traditional workout venues now that are usually owned and operated by women or queer people or POC When that shit is clearly and openly unacceptable it doesn t really happen I like being able to fit a safe and comfortable workout into my schedule instead of building my whole schedule around the one hour I can have a safe and comfortable workout To answer your questions   Not necessarily especially since trans women are included and are typically the group most likely to experience violence or harassment  Also trans men were invited to participate in the women s hour at my old gym which is a great option for another group that may experience violence in that setting     No because cis men don t experience violence or harassment in gym settings related to their gender identity    Not necessarily because there isn t really a universal experience of harassment or violence based on race that is specific to a gym setting LGBTQ people

Feminism,1615550295,     It s a bit like a person living in an island in oceania and saying that they won t watch their local football league because the quality isn t as high as in the premier league It doesn t make sense   I disagree  that person has every right to watch the best football they can find or their local football or both or neither There is no right or wrong  Yeah I sounded a bit silly what I meant was that the commentators seemed to speak as if the only reason people would watch football is if it s high level enough It s like saying people would only want to watch fighting matches to see who would objective win and so only watch heavyweight and superheavyweight fights but  in reality we know that people are just as interested if not more interested in fights of lower weight classes including interest in women s fights All you need to do is not seperate out women or different weight classes  or different events An example I can give you is from Go In the west knowledge about Japanese professionals     I am strongly against having men s section and women s section in sports I think there should be just  Open section and  Women s section no need to exclude women to give them they re own space Are you scared that some women might win against too many men   I always used to be against that idea on the basis that it could be unfair on men who felt obliged to hold back a bit when up against women On reflection that is a very very poor reason   If anything I fear that the reverse is actually the problem  having an open football league and then having to explain that women can participate it s just that in the   years since the rule came in no woman has made the grade is unlikely to do much for women s sport Neither woudl it benefit women s sport if if was just like now only with the handful of superstars missing because they are playing in a non elite men s league Am I laying it on a bit think Maybe But what about  x   m relay Let s have a mixed team in the Olympics   women just aren t gonna make the cut And whilst football is about skill to a very large extent it is also all about physicality Take the english PL Excluding goalkeepers the players are pretty much all   to    with the vast majority of those between about   and    A   year old man who was  at his peak  one of the fittest and best players in the league has very little chance of being able to compete physically any more How is a     woman who runs      slower than a man gonna have a chance Their skill levels would have to be through the roof which is not realistic and may still not be enough When my team play  I ve just checked  we can put out a side which includes five tall players who can go forward to attack the ball from corners Those five players average     m or        ok so normally only four of them are playing but I ve just googled and Wendie Renard at     was the tallest player at the     world cup I m speculating here but I d guess that if you were to put together a women s team including all the tallest women s players who play international football they d risk losing to my favourite men s team simply on the basis of being out jumped at set pieces even if they matched my team in every other way It would be fascinating to see those women who could compete and at what level But I fear it would be an exception that proves the rule that women can t match the men physically rather than an inspiration to other women And this is nothing to feel bad about   a lightweight male boxer gets on with being the best at his size he doesn t worry that if he were in a bar fight with a heavyweight he d be dead in   seconds  I thought of the idea that in MMA that Women in the same weight class as men could fight with little problem if   On the day before the fight the woman would have to weigh in heavier  likely the man would try to weigh in near the bottom of the weight class while the woman would try to weigh in near the top of the weight class   Remove the illegality of some moves for the woman for example she can t use eye gouges but  can hit in the below the belt area and hit a floored opponent This may sound uncivillised but actually this is necessary so that the man doesn t take it easy on the woman If he felt his balls were at risk in a way hers weren t he wouldn t feel the need to go easy  amp  x   B I agree with you that  the Korean Wpmen s Baduk League gained  more coverage     than the male one which is the biggest baduk tournament in korea a country were  In the west we have more familiarity with the Korean baduk scene than the Chinese weiqi one even though

Feminism,1615563684,To me I think the important thing is to just keep in mind the way discussing the beauty of women encourages men to act and makes women feel Like imagine you gave an hour long talk about a subject you re very knowledgeable in posted it online and every single comment was from someone saying you were really hot you were really ugly or that they liked your shirt or something  No one had anything to say about Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Networks or whatever you presented  They just wanted to talk about your body  Imagine that someone bigger than you and scarrier told you you were beautiful and then tried to follow you home Imagine how that might make you feel in other situations when others discussed your physical appearance And with that understanding in mind think about how you discuss women s bodies  So like  Wow I love polevaulting the athletes are so graceful is a thing you could say that is unlikely to devalue anybody but saying it about a specific female athlete might be a situation where you d want to be careful to not make her uncomfortable or encourage others to talk about her body 
Feminism,1615563524,Why should one temper the truth in order to coddle the fragile egos of those who barely consider you human It isn t always about trying to  win over the unconvinced  who are largely unconvinceable such as yourself  Sometimes the truth simply needs to be spoken For the world s most clich example I can think of a certain doctor who spoke the truth and was killed for it You really think that he should have begged like a lap dog at the feet of those with the guns

Feminism,1615563417,It s a derogatory term used first by Rush Limbaugh to describe feminists in general which is now often found in anti feminist circles to further the idea that feminists are dangerous irrational and militant People who use this term believe feminist critiques of society are akin to fascism and that feminists are seeking an oppressive regime that is anti man and anti free speech In this regime females strip males of their rights outlaw masculinity and use sex as a tool to enslave men People also just use it to describe feminists who aren t nice enough to them 
Feminism,1615563148,There is an entire stickied post here with a list of feminist resources for men and men s issues We discuss men s issues here frequently and over at  r MensLib I suggest you start there

Feminism,1615562578,I get why they do it but what if you can t make it for the allotted hour We definitely need more emphasis on stopping problematic behavior Once again it s asking women to modify their time while creepers carry on being creepers or whine about  being excluded from these times and spaces I used to go to a gym that had one room set aside just for women to work out in if they wanted to That s nice but personally I d like a room set aside just for gawkers harassers which they can be directed to when caught in the act I know it won t happen but it would make a point
Feminism,1615562195,As long as it doesn t interfere or inconvenience my life It s fine by me I don t need to go to a bar a gym or whatever at all hours   amp  x   B I would have a serious problem if it was for things I really need and might not have time to come back later Like gas stations grocery stores etc I think single gender clubs are perfectly fine

Feminism,1615561898,I just want to add one point the argument  men get attacked more by strangers is such bullshit It doesn t take into account how many more precarious women take to not face strangers how women and not men are scared going out at night cross the street when they see a man carry self defence objects plan their lives around being safe  If women were out at night carelessly like men I m sure we d seen much higher numbers of women being attacked by strangers 
Feminism,1615561800, gt And yeah that kind of attitude can be a  result of male gaze in the media This helps a lot  gt But a woman was going about her day answering a question about her religion  She wasn t doing a makeup tutorial or showing off a new outfit or something else to indicate that she was soliciting your opinion on her physical appearance The comment was without context I can see how saying someone is beautiful out of the blue is a problem What if I m watching the Olympics Say the long jump or the gymnastics and comment that it s beautiful because of the movement It s not in the context of the sport so much I will dial it back but just thinking out loud 
Feminism,1615561636,Yeah I was really confused because they said that it was okay to want it but not to say it
Feminism,1615561471,Yes I see people liking it but it s such a boring and cliche story I can t There is maybe one interesting shot there but from filmmaking perspective it s a bad short 
Feminism,1615561272,I ve seen those two Aquila rift being the hack short 
Feminism,1615561243,You ve gotten me confused for someone else but you also actually haven t provided evidence for your assertion or answered my question you re just wildly misinterpreting unemployment policy 
Feminism,1615561047,Oh we can both play that Nowhere there does it say what you claimed 
Feminism,1615561046,So this is kind of a complicated question  The behavior you re describing isn t what I d call  male gaze   Male gaze means that a piece of media was produced presenting women in a way to cater to male sexuality The term I d give to your behavior is  sexualization   A woman was going about her day answering a question about her religion  She wasn t doing a makeup tutorial or showing off a new outfit or something else to indicate that she was soliciting your opinion on her physical appearance  You didn t have anything to say about what her opinion was you had to make it about how she looks and whether you do or don t find her attractive  And yeah that kind of attitude can be a  result of male gaze in the media  When you re raised with imagery that makes you feel like female bodies exist for your view it can result in men reducing women to their appearance and that s bad because it means that women are reduced to their bodies  Beautiful women are treated as if their only value is in their bodies and ugly women are treated as if they have no value whatsoever So what you do about it is absolutely you keep it to yourself about how attractive or unattractive you think a stranger is unless they re asking for your opinion  And when you create media you don t portray any person specifically for the sexual satisfaction of the audience unless you re producing literal pornography  Media should be about telling the story of the characters you re presenting or communicating the ideas you re trying to communicate 
Feminism,1615561042,Your friend is incorrect male gaze is an academic term that refers to film and media first and foremost What you did might be objectification  And as for  what s wrong with it  from a feminist perspective you already got a reply  reinforces the idea of women being sexual objects But it s also wrong from artistic perspective if it doesn t add anything to the story or character and especially if it contradicts story or character Example of it done correctly when it could easily be ruined in hands of       directors Mad Max Fury Road When Max first sees the wives cleaning themselves most male directors would film it as  Angelina Jolie in a shower  type of thing You know what I m talking about Instead he filmed it in a way that makes sense  Max lusts for water not women Women are framed neutrally in wide and medium shots without camera lingering on their attractive bodies  Example where it s done poorly  almost every fucking movie Basically you can film ass and tits but only if it makes sense And it doesn t makes sense in most cases I love showing recent Netflix anthology  Love Death and Robots  as an example Two shorts  Witness and Aquila Rift  has a lot of nudity But one is done with purpose and dare I say taste adding to the tone and story and the other is done because writer and director are talentless hacks who think naked women  good visual storytelling  If you compare the two shorts you ll notice that despite clear time and effort put into both one is good at all levels not just usage of nudity and another is bad at all levels  writing directing even character design  Basically male gaze is just bad writing in almost all cases 
Feminism,1615560998,Well then such requirements don t exist to the best of both of our knowledge So the original question stands for all persons that would be capable to do such work 
Feminism,1615560736,For bars gyms clubs etc this is awesome Whether or not it s exclusive to trans ppl depends on the venue and if they decide to discriminate I don t think a man can pass as a trans woman or at least take the effort to effectively do so LGBT ppl and POC should get their own too at some places It s nice to be among community and know you won t be harassed I don t think it needs to be everywhere but as a queer woman the idea of only being around other women or LGBT ppl sounds amazing
Feminism,1615560727,You do need at least some skills for sex work If you re just doing extremely low rent prostitution  like streetwalking maybe not as much but if you are going to be a cam girl or a pole dancer or an exotic dancer or do sensual massage or whatever that definitely requires skills equipment and physical ability And even if you were just streetwalking that gig comes with enormous risk to your physical safety So you can t really just brush that off

Feminism,1615560268, gt Forcing you to go work in a machine shop when you have no experience or knowledge of how to do so would be incredibly dangerous  While I agree with that that requires like you said training and experience No such thing is required of sex work correct So the comparison would not be valid 
Feminism,1615560165,Forcing you to go work in a machine shop when you have no experience or knowledge of how to do so would be incredibly dangerous just because you physically would be able to do a job doesn t mean you have the skills to do it and they re not going to hire you anyway because you don t know what you re doing and could get yourself or somebody else killed The fact that you could  potentially work heavy machinery doesn t translate to actual practical knowledge about how to do so Sex work is similar It requires a particular skill set that yes you  could acquire but which you don t currently have and therefore would not be effective at that job anyway 
Feminism,1615560159, gt there s just a lot of practical concerns here that can t be boiled down to  well if sex work is work why shouldn t everyone have to do it if they can  We are looking at the same date and I am not sure why you would conclude we should  still call it as just another form of work  despite all these practical concerns Surely all these practical concerns prove in fact that it is  not just another form of work

Feminism,1615559951,That s mainly a business decision Gyms realised that many women don t feel safe or comfortable to train with men so they don t come It s marketing to gain customers  Men don t seem to feel uncomfortable with women so they would work out one way or another I don t see why gyms would make men only hours when there s little demand for that I personally got to a women only gym for different reasons but no men being there was a factor I don t want my ass and face being judged when I m doing sport I can t avoid it on a daily basis but if there are spaces where I can I ll gladly take the opportunity 
Feminism,1615559939,I especially don t like the way she thinks of being out at night as something you can just stop being terrified of That terror is ingrained pretty deep into my mind as my parents were very strict about that and I lived in a nasty bit of California for a while where all my fears were reinforced  I didn t get raped or mugged or anything but I did see someone get beaten up on the streets and I watched a car blow up At this point it s just an irrational terror which I will probably never get over
Feminism,1615559913,I don t know how to explain to you that you re not going to be denied unemployment for not applying for and accepting a job that is not within your current ability in terms of skill  Like what do you think sex work actually is Again nothing about unemployment implies that you need to apply for and accept absolutely any job

Feminism,1615559841,I feel like she has good points and this is a really complicated topic that a thoughtful feminist could come down on either side of I went to a university that as one of its core tenets is integrated with the neighborhood it s built in  Other schools in my city are in  nicer areas of town and even then are built with these huge walled off campuses and green manicured lawns  My school isn t  The dorms and student buildings are built on residential streets in a low income area of town that s rapidly gentrifying with the student population there  It wasn t unusual to see neighborhood people at college events or just using the green as a park to play with their kids  Students from the neighborhood with the grades can go there for free And there was this weird attitude you d often encounter in the students there  They d joke frequently about the dangerousness of the neighborhood  Just really mean stuff calling specific streets names based on rape jokes and jokes about the murder of sex workers  It was an attitude that student groups and campus organizations fought against tooth and nail but they d also be really really loud about the message of  don t go out alone at night use this campus van to drive to take you to the grocery store  But also it was incredibly incredibly dangerous to go out on campus after dark  I had  close and personal friends get robbed at gunpoint  One year a female student got kidnapped and forced into a van and she kicked the shit out of her captors until they dropped her off  streets away  I luckily never was mugged  I never went anywhere alone after dark  but my car was broken into  times in  years and stolen once  It was completely appropriate to be cautious walking around campus at night  Completely appropriate But it wasn t that the surrounding neighborhood was full of shitty people  We were a bunch of fucking rich college kids in a low income area  Anybody who had it in their minds to mug somebody we were extremely easy targets  After I graduated I lived a couple streets down for the next  or  years  It was mostly families immigrants and people of color and every time it snowed we would all go out together and shovel all the driveways and the sidewalks and any time a car got stuck on the road we would all run over and push it out  Once I left the lights on in my car and my neighbor who spoke no English knocked on my door gestured me over and pointed it out to me  I have never had such kind and friendly neighbors  amp  x   B It s possible for attitudes about safety and danger to be both harmful and justified  You can be unfairly demonizing a whole neighborhood of people because of racism and instilling fear as a means of control in women and also be correct about the level of danger that people are in I don t know the right way to combat that  I think it s a difficult line to walk  I think that it s important to look at actual data to determine how dangerous something  actually is before you tell someone to change her behavior to avoid it  And to be careful of the way you talk about whole communities of people based on the crimes of a few committed there  It is a very hard line to walk but it s one that should be walked with compassion 
Feminism,1615559814,Sex work is both illegal and dangerous It would also be ridiculous to ask for example married people to engage in sex work and violate their marriage vows or risk not receiving unemployment benefits People should never be forced into doing sex work Having to resort to prostitution if you lose your job is the very definition of survival sex Also what if you re a terrible prostitute What if nobody wants you to use your services Then what You know there s just a lot of practical concerns here that can t be boiled down to  well if sex work is work why shouldn t everyone have to do it if they can

Feminism,1615557838,I guess that means babies are on the side of allowing violence against women at birth  Obviously joking but the point stands Ignorance of a topic is not the same as having a conscious stance on it You cannot treat people who do know know or understand the same as those who understand but choose the wrong side If you do you actually risk pushing people the wrong way Statements like this do that Inform and advocate Stop shaming 
Feminism,1615557629,It s equally offensive to women and Jewish people speaking as someone in both groups Comparing gender equality to nazism is a big tell about someone s views on both 
Feminism,1615575029,Thank you for saying  writing this It is comforting to know that I m not the only one creeped out in the gym If I could just start a business right now I would just open a  members only all female gym See how many days of operation it would take for a man to complain that he isn t welcome lol 
Feminism,1615574751,I dunno but I don t think it justifies men sending women unsolicited dick picks Almost all people like chocolate  does that mean I should  make everyone eat chocolate 
Feminism,1615574732,By  biology I mean partly the fact that men are often taller and stronger than women and they have penises that they can use to rape It s influenced also by societal factors of course But at the end of the day there s only one sex who can forcibly impregnate the other 
Feminism,1615574698, gt Rather than focusing on  missing white women syndrome and calling it out we should be talking actively about those who are not brought to the spotlight on account of their lack of privilege I think we can focus on both 
Feminism,1615574651,I don t understand why asking this question is treated with hostility Can anyone explain 
Feminism,1615574585,What can also often pass as sly hostility under the guise of criticality is trying to  quiz people about specifically controversial figures because you are seeking a particular outcome from the conversation  ie you already have your opinion about this person but want that to be either validated or invalidated by others in this forum for your own reasons I don t take particularly kindly to people who do that because I think it s disingenuous and not really in the spirit of camaraderie  in asking you to provide context about a person who has subsequently been proven to be controversially feminist  I m helping other readers both learn to investigate new subjects or speakers and better evaluate information and claims for themselves I think that s a useful contribution even if I am not personally an expert or authority on this particular person or their body of work The fact that it has resulted in a hostile response from you suggests to me anyway that my instinct towards criticality is being appropriately applied 
Feminism,1615574530,The only  stereotype I am  promoting is the fact that men are more dangerous to women than the reverse and that fact is what explains the generalised difference that the OP asked about Of course it s not true of every man 
Feminism,1615574369,That s why I m talking to you not OP I m not sure it s helpful to convince people not to support Paglia or explain why she s not great but I m happy to talk to feminists about it  I figured this hadn t passed you by either  
Feminism,1615574363,I would refrain from making generalizations on men being ok with cat calling and sexual assault It promotes harmful stereotypes of men always wanting sex and being ok with physical boundaries being pushed  Even when you re not in physical danger you can be violated and those feelings are valid regardless of gender And physical force is not the only dynamic at play in every situation also could you explain what you mean by  biology 
Feminism,1615574263,Yes women and their sexuality generally aren t perceived as aggressive and threatening A woman s sexuality is considered dishonourable to herself at worst 
Feminism,1615574191,Thank you  I have since also reviewed her wiki and came to much the same conclusions especially re that line about Hoff Sommers This is what ultimately makes me feel that OP s general ask about feminists feelings on her is more than a little leading and perhaps even a bit disingenuous  I personally don t count folks who self identify as libertarian as particularly effective feminists and the deeper one goes into examining her body of work and her beliefs  the more dubious it is that she is in fact representative of modern feminism in anything but name 
Feminism,1615573704,Oh I never thought of this and I agree I think the    novelty of it for the lack of a better term is a big part of the appeal I also came across a tweet that said men would actually welcome being inappropriately flirted to in gaming communities because they lack attention and affection overall which had like a few thousand or so likes I think it s a similar case If you re really  literally thirsty even seawater will taste satiating 
Feminism,1615573460,In that situation Muslims have reason to fear pervasive discrimination and violence because some people do actually believe they are all extremists that to me is the biggest difference 
Feminism,1615573447,Dick pics are a latent threat There s no threat presented by receiving a picture of a vulva It s why men on the whole respond positively also to women cat calling or touching them in public What s she going to do attack him with her vulva Sure some women are violent blah blah blah but on aggregate the threat presented to men by women is so low it s nearly zero The threat presented to women by men is much higher So i believe it is in a way to do with  biology but absolutely not because men  have higher sex drives or  are socialised to  Men can rape and kill us much more easily than we can do any harm to them Of course we respond differently 
Feminism,1615573397,Of course But that is not the premise in your original question  AOC is my people but some  girlboss CEO enriching herself at the expense of her exploited workers and society at large is not empowering This is not something I would aspire to as as woman We don t need more billionaires not even black lesbian disabled ones I would rather have an old white dude with progressive policies that shares the profits of the company with its workers 
Feminism,1615573359,Men aren t bombarded with vagina pics or unwanted advances      frankly with any advances but that s a different topic  This likely has to do with their perception of these occurrences when they do happen 
Feminism,1615573351,Racists certainly would consider that derailing when they want to spew ignorant hate in peace 
Feminism,1615573191,The closest corollary to  NotAllMen would be  AllLivesMatter In both cases they were created to seemingly counter a statement no one was making  that  literally all men are rapists abusers or that  other groups deserve to be killed by cops  and all they each ultimately serve to do is undercut the expression of a legitimate problem 
Feminism,1615572892,Amazing I wish there were women only cars on subway trains especially 
Feminism,1615572878,I agree that many people use NotAllMen in bad faith to derail conversation If someone post     said NotAllMuslims would that be considered derailing the conversation on the threat of religious extremism in the Middle East 
Feminism,1615572731,Sure Don t pretend that But it s empowering to women and progressive in terms of equality as long as the person elected actually wants to do those things right 
Feminism,1615572728,Just so ya know the reason there aren t men only gyms is because there isn t enough of a demand for them There s just no money to be made in men only gyms
Feminism,1615572643, gt No because cis men don t experience violence or harassment in gym settings related to their gender identity I d put a caveat on that one While it s not really relevant in the context of a gym I think it s fair to have specific time slots at venues for specific groups in other settings Everyone needs a safe space sometimes  It can be harder for men to open up about certain issues in a mixed setting for example than in a group that they know consists mostly of other men who are dealing with the same issues 
Feminism,1615572409,I m fine with it depending on the context A store that is  Whites Only all the time has a different connotation than  Women s Hour Tuesday    PM or  Weekly Bisexual support group   amp  x   B  gt Do you think this is exclusionary to trans people I don t think that women only is exclusionary to trans people Trans women are women and should be allowed in those spaces Anyone trying to keep trans women out isn t doing it because of a women only space they re doing because they re opposed to trans people to begin with  gt Should men also get an hour    gt    gt Should other groups e g races LGBT etc also get their own time slots Sure why not I know a few spaces in my city that have men s only hours that either host support groups for men open a safe space for men to discuss issues they think are specific to them or just give a space for gay men to mingle without dealing with drunk sorority girls They re also welcoming of trans men I don t have a problem with time slots as long as they re just that Specific times slots that can be dedicated to specific groups or topics while the business is open to everyone at all other times 
Feminism,1615572048,Yeahhh like i watch far too much true crime so even though i myself havent had many experiences where ive been in danger i remember all the murdered women and girls i read about everytime i go out  at night I can t just flip a switch and forget those stories and just stop being nervous And it is defo verging on irrational but if that irrationality saves my life at some point then im not complaining haha 
Feminism,1615571856,If it s a private venue it seems ok   gt Is it exclusionary to trans people  If trans women are allowed during this hour no If trans women aren t allowed during this hour yes   gt Should men also get an hour Do men want an hour If so they could speak to management and if there s enough demand they could get their special hour  gt Should other groups e g races LGBT etc also get their own time slots Probably not But it would depend on the kind of venue It would also probably be good for it to be optional 
Feminism,1615571705,I am a WOC and while I would like more political representation from WOC for their diverse perspectives I am not going to pretend that having a woman in a position of power does anything for equality unless she is interested in uplifting others and dismantling systems of oppression Too often female politicians are simply there to maintain the status quo while providing better optics No thanks 
Feminism,1615571673,Yes I know But in the second wave there were people pushing the idea that femininity not only hegemonic femininity  was inherently inherently patriarchal and that the only reason a woman would want to be feminine is because she was brainwashed by patriarchy A lot like the idea that political lesbians held that the only reason that they were straight  women was because of patriarchal influence And I didn t said that the idea that femininity is bad did originate with feminists but there were feminists who  have equated femininty with being weak and conforming to the standards men set for women  
Feminism,1615571636,One thing that I ve seen happen a lot is people who do not take a side and try to stay neutral actively look the other way when things are happening or even deny it happens I think that s a horrible thing to do and only helps the patriarchy abusers and yes makes them on the side of allowing it to happen By looking the other way you are actively helping the other side However there is a spectrum between that  or worse and actively being on our side and not all positions are equally bad 
Feminism,1615571600,Right Like have they considered that all the precautions we take is one of the  reasons we re attacked at a lower rate And also that physical violence isn t the only thing to be wary of    of women in the uk have been sexually harrassed most people i know have had instances of being followed home or approached by random men or have had abuse yelled at them from across the street So to say that the streets arent dangerous is incredibly misinformed because although i dont know anyone who s been murdered almost every woman i know has been in a dangerous situation that could have escalated if not for the precautions they took at the time 
Feminism,1615571388,Yeah You could say she s gone astray in philosophical indulgence On the matter of child sexuality it sort of beckons back to this       French petition against age of consent laws

Feminism,1615571091,You can tell a lot by who supports her conservatives reactionaries like Jordan Peterson Not mainstream feminists unless you mean  feminists like fellow conservative Christina Hoff Summers  Something I didn t realize until looking her up just now she is also pro pedophilia  WTF  gt Camille Paglia has for almost three decades unrepentantly advocated for the legalization of sexual contact between adults and children of  any age  as well as the legalization of child pornography She is a pro pedophilia advocate who has repeatedly given her support to NAMBLA  the North American Man Boy Love Association  and has gone on record numerous times to state that she thinks  kiddie porn should be legalized  gt In Paglia s mind children are being harmed not by sexual contact with adults but by society s stigma surrounding pedophilia  gt  gt The damage from many pedophiliac encounters probably comes as some psychologists suggest less from the contact itself than from the culturally enforced stress and secrecy surrounding it   gt She also explained that the way to put an end to under age sex tourism in third world countries was to replace Christian morality in the West with  a more liberal pagan one that would allow for adults to freely court children for sex in our own societies In her mind the  sexual borderline between adults and children is an artificial construct that society would benefit from deconstructing  Lolita melts the sexual borderline that society has artificially drawn between child and adult    Well learning this definitely ruined my morning 
Feminism,1615571024,I have no  very specific opinion regarding her May I ask how you deduced that I m quite new to her writing myself I ve come here to get engage in some insightful discussion and bounce ideas If you haven t any knowledge of her obviously such a question would seem generalist   for those who know her will understand how such an open ended question fits here and lends itself to telling opinions It suffices to ignore the post if you haven t any useful contribution to make Sly hostility under the guise of criticality isn t the slightest bit noble 
Feminism,1615570975,The one good thing to the term was that it was from my experience an acceptance of masculinity in girls Notably there isn t an equivalent for feminine boys seen as the worse  I actually like thinking of my little self as tomboy it was a point of pride not negativity what was negative was the attitude I then took towards feminine girls and the color pink I think it did help me notice gender issues more as I didn t understand why I was treated so differently then boys despite thinking we were one in the same in our hobbies and such I also believe I may have higher levels of testosterone then most women and maybe that plays a small part in girls masculinity  or what society perceives as masculine behavior hobbies 
Feminism,1615570596,something to consider that i havent seen anyone bring up yet womens only hours at gyms are also good for women who wear hijab or other religious garb Many of them are able to take off their hijab headscarf in front of other women but not in front of men It can be difficult hot to work out in hijab so being able to take it off for an hour at the gym is a nice thing for them 
Feminism,1615570377,I haven t actually read any of her books This post is very likely the first I heard of her  I looked up her wiki and she doesn t even have a  controversies section  thus why I asked for more context I think it s rather peculiar to already have a very specific opinion about someone  but not share it and then come ask an extremely general question about the person 
Feminism,1615570249,There always seems to be men at my gym pool just hanging around in the pool and not swimming it is really uncomfortable The men also hog the jacuzzi and steam rooms and I can t go in there as the only women when  or  middle age dudes are taking up all the space Would love a women s hour   
Feminism,1615570106,The issue is what time would work It would be difficult to pick a time that everyone who wants to make it to those hours wouldn t be able to Likewise someone excluded from those hours might already have a relationship with the gym where they were working out at a specific hour that worked for them based on their schedule and they may now get kicked out of the gym for that time if that ends up being the women s only hour that the gym chooses That would present some pretty serious legal issues So it s kind of hard to establish women only hours at pre established gyms where you might have to dislocate people who were already there at that hour and can t work out at a different time I really only see it working for a business that is just starting and having it pre set from the beginning so members know exactly when they are allowed when they first sign up Another option is to build women designated rooms as extensions to gyms But the issue with that is if there will be enough women that would justify spending money adding an extension to the building 
Feminism,1615570078,I lived in a neighborhood where some gyms had women only classes to accommodate a religious group that was a big part of the neighborhood where the women wouldn t be able to work out with men within the rules of that religion I felt conflicted about it because I disagreed with those rules but was happy that these women had access to that space and time where otherwise they wouldn t  Also lived in a neighborhood where a bar geared toward college students had a women only hour where beer was   for that hour Then once the women were drunk they d let in the men That s for sure bad and scary 
Feminism,1615569881,I mean in relation to her individualist take on feminism Do you concur to her aphorisms on the modern decadence of womanhood to self  infantilisation and so on I find most feminists  particularly womxn find her ideas riddled with fallacy

Feminism,1615568020,That s not actually the same as feminists setting the standard for feminity being bad Plenty of women rejected the expectation of hegemonic femininity before second wave feminism 
Feminism,1615567970,Sure That s a good point But as for the messaging and the lag inherent somethings missing where progress is either stopped by not being up to date or as I ve asked hindered by messaging ill suited to younger people University drop out rate may be a huge factor I m a drop out Between both sexes law school has a high failure rate and the main reason I see people pick law is that coming out of high school as it is now  standard to try pursue higher education those that see law as the best fit to their personality may be more in line with excelling in environments more focused on wholistic goals By that I mean law school is hell and usually only the most studious competitive and some mix of self esteem and narcissism really excel Giving messaging about breaking the glass ceiling might lead more socially minded people to pick the wrong profession Or perhaps more likely law school is fine law is fine law school might not need and revision or aid and that the fact that the post graduate opportunities are controlled by people      years older than law school graduates might mean that any changes to law school would unjustly push for for things that time is already set to fix I e when the generations shift the problem may reveal it self to be already solved So what s the harm in pushing people to a field like that Well beyond balance it s a costly road mentally and financially

Feminism,1615564021,   there are also laws regarding workplace safety standards and gendered labor requirements People are not obligated to accept unsafe work or unsafe working conditions  if your claim is that unskilled sex work is particularly dangerous than it would track with our previous claims that UI compensation would not be contingent on someone especially of a specific gender accepting that kind of work simply because  it is available   That s not how UI laws work in spirit or in practice  in the US or literally any other place that has a UI system and associated labor laws Most sex workers would qualify as either indepdent contractors or small business owners depending on the scale of their practice In addition to marketing and promotion scheduling and basic customer service interaction skills sex workers have to also have the financial management skills to track and report their own income and expenses  they could outsource some of this labor at cost but as independent contractor that still requires a certain amount knowledge about bookkeeping There are also matters of health and safety navigating insurance etc  a legal sex work environment would include a lot of same basic adherence to the standards of other service based businesses  you seem to be assuming that legalized sex work would continue to be carried out in an unregulated environment where most business was cash based  That s a deeply incorrect and fallacious assumption and like your other fallacious assumptions it undermines the majority of your  argument  
Feminism,1615563837,Would that be this one or Where is it said there  
Feminism,1615563795, gt I ve learned it takes all kinds and different people have different strengths The writer may not be an eloquent public speaker The person who works behind the scenes may not be comfortable protesting in a crowd The person that trys to educate on an individual basis because they connect better that way may not have things posted on social media And the movement leader from a year ago may now be battling cancer and no longer has the energy to devote to a cause  But isn t this exactly what she s implicitly lauding All of the things one might do to resist the status quo 
Feminism,1615581916,Please don t pit people here against each other like this I really don t appreciate it and it s really very hostile on your part for someone who has spent so much energy complaining that  we re not being nice enough as a community for you You aren t entitled to use my patience for engaging with you as a weapon against someone else  especially since you ve since gone on to abuse my patience and good will as well 
Feminism,1615581905,Some questions come across as a deliberate attempt to upset or rile up feminists Especially when the questions come across as willfully ignorant Women have been informing men for quite some time on what is acceptable how we want to be treated  as equal human beings of worth and on what behaviour we find unacceptable and the reasons for it all Men know the answers to these questions most of the time so the people that ask certain questions seem like trolls For example someone asked recently  why do women wear revealing clothes if they don t want to be stared at  It was a ridiculous question meant to upset people that s why it was downvoted   This is just my opinion one why SOME questions are downvoted 
Feminism,1615581888,No This is an authoritary posture and infringement of rights and probably would cause the increase of violent crimes due the restriction And would make men hate and blame women even more 
Feminism,1615581788,Exactly this and I also think it s partly because it s a dating app I think the percentage that like it wpuld go down  probably not too too much though if it was another platform 
Feminism,1615581768,Thank you for reminding me that no good deed goes unpunished 
Feminism,1615581689,From the comments on their profiles I doubt this person is actually a feminist at all 
Feminism,1615581542,Male gaze is typically used to describe the portrayal of women not the audience s reception of portrayal of women Your friend probably meant to say that you immediately jumped to a  beautiful ugly category of consideration when you saw a woman but didn t do so for men which might be indicative of something but that is not what male gaze is about 
Feminism,1615581506,Women only hours don t exist because women are insecure about their bodies and afraid of working out in front of attractive men They exist because of the sexual harassment and safety issues women face in a typical gym environment 
Feminism,1615581234,I clarified that harassing men in my point of view and from what I know from statistics is an individual problematic not a social norm and behavior 
Feminism,1615581161,I apologise for eventually running out of energy against the barrage from this community 
Feminism,1615581159,You re a fellow feminist yet don t understand other feminist views Seems a little low effort or simply ignorant  I won t ask around Provide me surveys about men feeling uncomfortable and about men only gyms being bashed 
Feminism,1615581035,Your passive aggressive attitude is not doing you any favours either I think we all really could ve done without this response from you 
Feminism,1615580908,Those men are sexists Women get better car insurance in my country because women cause fewer accidents than men  this is a fact So the belief that women suck at driving is purely sexist and ignorant and some men say this to hurt us and make us seem like inferior people 
Feminism,1615580895,I was pretty clear I don t care about the points A lot of people here seem able to read my mind and correct that It s   strange that they know so much about my motives but still can t speculate on why some question is downvoted 
Feminism,1615580614,It s not a systematic problem that women get harassed in gyms either   by definition it s not systematic because there is no law or federal systems in place which enable it     women getting harassed in gyms isn t nearly as common a problem as this thread would have you believe I have worked in a gym for   years and in that entire time we have only had two problems of  men harassing women and they were immediately expunged from the gym and had their memberships revoked Making eye contact is not harassment Saying hello isn t harassment either  We have also investigated alleged issues of harassment by women when upon investigation turned out the guy was just asking to engage in conversation or give her some lifting tips because her form was dangerously off Just because you make eye contact with a guy in the gym and you attractive doesn t mean he is harassing you or is picturing you naked This seems like an overt demonization of men  The  women s only hours are for women who feel self conscious working out  in front of men or who don t like the  meathead aspect of working out in a male dominated gym  Or Sometimes it s something as simple as not wanting to hear the grunting and the dropping of weights  This notion that there is some epidemic of men harassing us in gyms is just patently false Men feel self conscious when working out too Men feel  body awareness as well especially when they are overweight working out around gorgeous       hyper athletic women  Do you think that men  especially short weak or overweight men aren t capable of being self conscious or ashamed of their body in front of the opposite sex The idea of women getting women s only buisness hours is strictly as advantage for us that effects only us  Yet we are all dancing around calling it what it is on some misinformed wishy washy anecdotal evidence which isnt representative of the norm  It is a double standard that works in the favour of us women Plain and simple  Yet for some reason no one on this thread wants to recognize that women have any advantages in society over men 
Feminism,1615580609,Hey Thanks again Of course we can t read other people s minds but we can typically see why some comments are downvoted to hell Everywhere else on reddit it s pretty transparent  to me  but it s super not clear here  to me  I m really surprised people would consider that comment islamophonic  my understanding was that it was being held as a parody like  wouldn t it be ridiculous for people to say that about Muslims so why is it different for  allmen   Anyway thanks for engaging with me 
Feminism,1615580303,I would wager that your threshold for what qualifies as  hostile and  attacking is extremely low but sure 
Feminism,1615580235,I really don t understand the insistent hostility nor the semantic pedantry It s completely clear that a community downvoting a comment doesn t accept it Anyway someone else has kindly started to engage with me so you don t need to keep attacking 
Feminism,1615580060,Please respect our  top level comment rule   which requires that all direct replies to posted questions must come from feminists and reflect a feminist perspective Non feminists may participate in nested comments only Comment you won t get another warning 
Feminism,1615580038, gt When men try to open up their own gyms they get labelled as misogynists and get vandalized protested There are a lot of gyms that are functionally men only the ones that were around ended up getting shut down because no one was using them IIRC
Feminism,1615579823,Thank you for your answer Re unacceptable questions There s a bit in the sidebar that feminism supporting questions should be in r Feminism but questioning or criticising feminism should be here It s really that that caused me to ask in the first place I infer  safe place for difficult questions from that  The thread that had me wondering is somewhere else in r AskFeminists and I don t know about cross linking I couldn t see anything about it that caused people to dislike some other OP s question and when I asked I just got shut down so I came here I agree it s very hypothetical without that context I guess I ll never know 
Feminism,1615579822,Wow I remember curves from when I was a kid I didn t realize that was an all women s gym I will look into it Thank you 
Feminism,1615579684,It s not that they re not  acceptable  If they weren t  acceptable  I would remove them  gt I am asking a question in ask feminists The question is  why don t you like some questions   Some questions is very vague Why don t you like some foods Why don t you like some people Why don t you like some colors 
Feminism,1615579667,Not true Plenty men feel uncomfortable working out around women  but making a  men only buisiness hour is financial suicide as many of our  outspoken radical feminist sisters think this is a sign of misogyny and treat it as such I m cool with exclusionary buisness hours but it really only goes one way and it s in the favour of women almost all the time Saying  I feel like this when I work out so I need a gender exclusive gym hour can go both ways The difference is no one cares about it when it s men who bring up the issue When men try to open up their own gyms they get labelled as misogynists and get vandalized protested This happened in my home town of White Rock BC in      Do you really think men can t be self conscious or ashamed of their body or feel uncomfortable working out in front of attractive athletic women Imagine your a guy who is overweight and self conscious and you go to your local gym and all the women in there are in excellent shape Instagram model levels of fitness  You don t think men ever go through that scenario Really  I don t understand why so many fellow feminists think being a man is some golden lottery ticket to an easy go lucky life where there is no emotional turmoil Just because men don t express themselves openly due to being ridiculed for expressing emotion by men and women doesn t mean that these things don t effect them I m sure if you asked around many guys especially the ones who are a little more out of shape would be a lot more comfortable working out in male only gyms 
Feminism,1615579361,As I told you before I m not complaining and it s not about points I m asking about why some questions are acceptable I also said very clearly that it s not about what I feel should be downvoted or upvoted Would you mind not patronising me and projecting an issue about my feelings into this conversation Really it s incredibly rude  I am asking a question in ask feminists The question is  why don t you like some questions  
Feminism,1615579252,There s a good bit of  this at play     There s the sexist notion that the man should drive so a woman driving bad is clearly because she s a woman 
Feminism,1615579241, gt You wanna play games call Milton Bradley just wanted to butt in and say I think you re a great mod
Feminism,1615579141,wow that s fucked up I ve heard the bullshit  you need two hands to clap adage as well  I do hope that prevailing generations can make a change on this absolute bullshit 
Feminism,1615579078,Understandably so I just didn t know where it was coming from 
Feminism,1615578975,Because complaining that other people who none of us are responsible for are downvoting posts you don t think should be downvoted is an annoying thing to do 
Feminism,1615578928,   or write run on sentences  Seriously though I urge you to resist the temptation to think of men s violence against women as something that only  or primarily happens at the hands of  the psyco in central park at  am    Most women who are raped know their attacker    That means it s a much deeper problem than a few  psycos  as comforting as it might be for us  non psycos to think in such simplistic terms  The unfortunate  and horrifying truth is that  every man is capable of committing such violence and we must start by acknowledging that capacity in ourselves and resisting it with everything we have Then we can work on the guys around us  Anything less is an insult to the women we love  and  by the way should be insulting to ourselves as guys since it suggests that we re incapable of rising above such horrible behavior and selfish ignorance And finally You can ditch the absurd  in the west thing because it is also beneath you as a human being There s no difference in the morality of men in the  west compared to the  east  whatever those terms are supposed to represent in your comment Men all over the planet have a problem with patriarchal thinking and violent assumptions We need to attack it around the world including here at home 
Feminism,1615578830,That must be where the mountain hogging dudes go when the snow melts  D
Feminism,1615578542,I understand the rhetorical reason for the proposed curfew but just to think of the notion a bit deeper what do you mean by men Are binary trans men included nonbinary masc presenting queer men in general Men with disabilities  who do we exclude when we say  men  
Feminism,1615578400,This is a small subreddit even comments that get a bunch of downvotes still get responses I literally can t answer why some questions get downvoted I don t know why other people do what they do Neither does anyone else 
Feminism,1615578363,Wait the lady in this article is sexually harassing random men that s so fucked      
Feminism,1615578148,That s literally how reddit works Upvotes move comments up and downvotes move comments down  suppress It s nothing about what I feel like should be upvoted or downvoted I m asking why some questions are downvoted I don t understand why you keep responding if you don t want to consider the question The only dramatic and patronising tone and language has been from you 
Feminism,1615577930,This isn t actually difficult I asked you if you think women can rape men You babbled on about the legal definition and pretended you didn t understand what I was asking you You wanna play games call Milton Bradley 
Feminism,1615577915,well if there wasn t a negative connotation to the term  sexual in this context then women wouldn t be afraid to work out amongst other men right predatory is exactly what women are afraid of when    of rapists are men and not women it s understandable that  predatory wouldn t seem like the right term from a man s point of view but you have to see it from the opposite gender s perspective 
Feminism,1615577879,Thanks for the nasty tone It s not about the points it s about silencing the question Downvotes move comments out of visibility So why are some questions suppressed and not answered I m not complaining I m asking you a question   in a sub called ask feminists 
Feminism,1615577872,Ok but I don t understand the question Are you asking if I believe the definition is moral 
Feminism,1615577751,Dude it s fucking downvotes It s fake internet points who gives a shit
Feminism,1615577655,Advising someone to stay in and instituting a curfew are not comparable Which isn t to suggest that the people saying that women should stay indoors are justified but it s not the same thing 
Feminism,1615577604,Generally when this is proposed it s meant to illustrate the ridiculousness of people telling women to just stay inside or not go out after dark to avoid being the victims of violent crime 
Feminism,1615577594,My original statement was  in UK law only penetration with a penis is rape     is that the bit you take issue with 
Feminism,1615577550,What do you mean It is the actual legal definition I am using the word as it is defined 
Feminism,1615577540,So by that logic thinking masculinity is bad as a man is a sign of internalized misandry I m just playing devils advocate here but I see a lot of generalizations made that if done the other way would be taken as very misogynistic 
Feminism,1615577470,I didn t ask you for the legal definition I asked YOU for what YOU are saying Do you think this  legal definition is accurate and correct 
Feminism,1615577417,I m not a fan of the  predatory term but I understand you are talking about being sexualized If this helps women getting comfortable it is good then 
Feminism,1615577415,I ve seen women respond to dick picks with strap on pics or pics of other men s dicks though as a way of responding to a threatening message with a threat of their own  It does seem like  receiving penetrative sex is perceived as threatening in a way that non penetrative sex or  giving penetrative sex just isn t  There are various kinds of rape and sexual assault but penetrative rape seems to cause more visceral fear  and it s often treated differently under the law  
Feminism,1615577327,Can you provide a citation that suggests that the curfew was proposed in earnest good faith and not as a rhetorical device 
Feminism,1615577314,Is it possible you ve missed the point here The suggestion was intended to make you outraged and then think about how outrageous it is that we expect women to stay in after dark lest they be raped and or murdered 
Feminism,1615577260, gt And I didn t said that the idea that femininity is bad did originate with feminists  the person i responded to did so this kind of is entirely beside the point of my comment s context
Feminism,1615577244,The statement was made for the exact purpose that it was made for highlight that when men are told to stay inside a huge fuss is created over this while it is normalized to say to female femme victims to just stay inside 
Feminism,1615577225,It is not my  stance  It is the legal definition of rape in the United Kingdom Rape is penetration by the penis of mouth anus or vagina Penetration of the body by anything other than a penis is legally  sexual assault by penetration  See here  
Feminism,1615577180,I mean obviously not but when this is  proposed it s directly in response to women being told they shouldn t go out for their own safety from   men So yes if the choice is between women having a curfew to keep us safe and men having a curfew my vote is for a curfew on men 
Feminism,1615577156,We get a lot of people posting gotcha s here Like   hourly  Sorry that offends you but my skepticism is warranted by experience 
Feminism,1615577020,If your stance is that women cannot rape men you are not welcome to make top level comments here Please clarify this statement immediately 
Feminism,1615576840,That would be quite the infringement on their civil rights don t you think 
Feminism,1615576789,In UK law only penetration with a penis is rape Females can sexually assault but not commit rape 
Feminism,1615576695,Curves was a big one back in the day  are they still around 
Feminism,1615576595,I cannot answer that for you This is Reddit and people often prefer to vote rather than participate But nobody is being  hostile  
Feminism,1615576532,Both that question and my question are downvoted and quite quickly I thought the point of the sub was to ask the difficult questions which wouldn t be acceptable elsewhere So why are these questions downvoted 
Feminism,1615576386,I posted a similar question once but about the traits we found attractive If we can agree that these preferences are caused or at least influenced by patriarchy should we strive to  fix and eradicate them  However at the same time choice is still a non negotiable tenet of feminism And your choice is your choice alone I think there s no clear cut answer whether it s simply your preferences or you were  brainwashed by the patriarchy into having these likes  and dislikes  You can really apply this logic to a lot of things such as liking makeup or wanting to be a stay at home mom  But it is important to at least examine where these preferences come from Maybe it IS caused influenced by patriarchy but the question is whether you should get rid of it or not As basic and cliche of an answer it is I think as long as you re still genuinely happy with your decisions you re not hurting or forcing anyone to align with your preferences and fully support the reversal of these roles then you re okay 
Feminism,1615576291,I ve never felt weird at a gym with men so for me personally it doesn t feel necessary but I have heard about creeps so maybe my experience isn t everyone else s
Feminism,1615576283,Not in a predatory way  But I haven t experienced any judgement in my gym in over  years yet Most aren t in the position to judge anyway  D It s not an Instagram gym Just women in old ugly clothes doing stuff 
Feminism,1615576070,I can t because I don t know what you re using to browse Reddit There is a search bar usually somewhere in the upper right hand corner 
Feminism,1615576050,And even then you don t need a penis to penetrate someone s body

Feminism,1615575584,As I guy I almost wish I could go to a women only gym so there wouldn t be weirdly competitive men trying to claim multiple machines weights benches all at the same time  Gotta admit I ve never seen a woman do this 
Feminism,1615575551,It is definitely NOT okay If we women demand to exist and be treated equally as men we should demand it in every context  Segregation of the sexes in public spaces is dangerous and only reinforces sexual discrimination   Where I m from   such attempts of segregation are seen as dangerous Islamist interventions It s quite regressive not being able to share the same space with men There is harassment in the universities as well does that mean we should have separate universities too  Harassment is everywhere It is the harassment that should be not us  This paper explains a lot   
Feminism,1615575124,There is a women s only gym I would love to go there 
Feminism,1615575122,I never disagreed that men are as a whole more dangerous to women Rather I disagreed with that being the causality for men generally responding positively with being sexually harassed I m still rather curious as to what you see as being a biological causality

Feminism,1615595817,Yeah and nothing in my post history is non feminist I have never said anything non feminist I have just challenged anti male rhetoric Apparently you can t tell the difference between the two Sorry I forgot this was an echo chamber where everyone likes to pretend we are helpless victims and men are just gawking slathering rapists  instead of actually addressing real issues of gender inequality 
Feminism,1615595797,I haven t been here long but I really haven t seen any questions like that I have seen plenty of good answers that have expanded my understanding of feminism but questions Nah

Feminism,1615595189,I agree but also I m worried if I were to directly ask him these questions he might subconsciously answer the way he thinks I ll approve and not how he genuinely thinks
Feminism,1615594968,i think its a good idea but id rather them just check people prior to joinging
Feminism,1615594861,I don t understand why you think your experience is fact while everyone else s is just  anecdotal evidence  You are also not the only person who has ever worked in a gym  People don t report sexual harassment a lot of the time It s ridiculous to think that the only time it happens is when someone brings the issue to HR  Also side note isn t HR supposed to help the company deal with issues between employees not the customers  I was an instructor at a gym for years I knew a lot of women who would say things like  oh don t go into the weight room right now that one guy is there who always comments on womens butts or  that new guy keeps following me around the gym or  you know the guy that always wears the orange shorts he keeps making creepy comments when I squats  These things happen all the time and don t get reported for various reasons Maybe the woman is afraid of retaliation Maybe she s scared that she won t be believed Will they want proof Is the staff safe to confide in I was even told by the front desk guy that he wanted to watch me swim naked did I report it No I just kept my distance I m shy and hate confrontation  I m sick of the  It s not my experience so it can t be true mindset Also this isn t to say men don t have  insecurities or other problems just that there is a legitimate reason gyms decide to have a safe place for women whether you see it or not 
Feminism,1615594843,either way would work without putting a strain on our relationship Once I got his response I would likely just tell him it was a test and he would understand
Feminism,1615594605,More people get robbed than raped but nobody has proposed a curfew because there are thieves among us Where are the  I hate all men Twitter posts because it s mostly men that engage in theft    Funny how there are no millions of theft victims walking around permanently traumatized and venting their   metoo stories and hatred of men all over social media   Men have been to war where they died by the hundreds of thousands for Christ sake and if they came back and said  I hate all so and so of some nationality or race it would rightly be regarded as racist profiling or xenophobia In fact it is regarded as profiling when it comes to Japanese detention camps as it rightly should But feminists profile an entire gender and it s  activism  
Feminism,1615594590,She could just ask his opinion It can put a strain on a relationship knowing that the other party would rather misrepresent themselves than trust you to give an honest answer to a question 
Feminism,1615594526,That s less a theory and more an observation without an explanation for the perceived differences and the explanation is the interesting part Why do you think men and women view these things differently Do you think it s biological  iffy  or do you think there are social dynamics that cause men and women to react differently to the same or similar events relating to sexuality 
Feminism,1615594478,No they wouldn t These Men believe that they woukd be fine with harassment and catcalling but are the same ones that gag at the idea of dating an unattractive woman  happened to me twice or cannot be in a room with a gay man from fear of being harassed 
Feminism,1615594473, gt This attitude doesn t help our cause and is why many serious issues effecting women get sidelined What do you mean  our cause  You re clearly an anti feminist doing a shitty job of pretending to be a feminist to stir shit up You know we can see your post history yeah

Feminism,1615594195,Muslims aren t the group in power while men are Men set the standards in politics law moral and ethics in our society Muslims don t Also there are far more men who rape or justify rape than muslims who flew into the towers And those weren t even doing it because they re Muslims but because they were at war with the USA It s just ridiculous to compare this 
Feminism,1615593901,I don t know how to say I don t see why without being extremely ignorant or quite provocative   Let me try this i think they re saying  it s obviously unreasonable to label Muslims based on      there s a parallel with labelling  men based on rapists  I might be missing their intended point of course but if my understanding is about right what s the ignorant provocative bit 
Feminism,1615593879,Because a lot of men dont really see women as truly human but as an inferior being So we must be worse than them at everything

Feminism,1615592625,Women are followed and assaulted and verbally harassed by men who are in fact predatory I know this behavior isn t as easily noticed when you aren t a victim of it but predatory is the only accurate word for it It s creepy and animalistic in nature Not because we re naturally like this but because this is the only way these men know to approach women because they tend to see us as game or an end goal

Feminism,1615586204,Side rant I think we need to find a way to be comfortable talking about behaviors even if there is an ethnic component to it Acknowledging a particular undesirable behavior happens more often in minority communities than in white communities doesn t need to be seen as confirming racist ideology It doesn t mean that those behaviors are genetic or otherwise inherent to ethnic minorities A lot of it is tied to a legacy of poverty more than anything else I m Afro Latina I can definitely say that there is more fear involved with walking alone ethnically diverse neighborhoods because those are the neighborhoods where I experience street harassment I can t even count the number of times that I ve been followed while walking alone I have not had that experience in white majority communities and I doubt that that pattern is unique to me IMOP the key to not being racist about it is understanding that the present higher prevalence of those behaviors doesn t mean that black and Hispanic men are inherently more sexist  You don t solve racism by pretending that these problems don t exist When you do pretend the problem isn t there it s not just the white hipster s fear that you re dismissing You re also dismissing the minority women who live in those neighborhoods and have a higher rate of victimization than suburban women

Feminism,1615585256,What is gender culture   If you are referring to conventional gender roles and norms  feminism has long been critiquing normative femininity and masculinity  including through the constructs of internalised misogyny and concepts such as the patriarchal bargain    There is no clear separation between sex and normative gender either in that sexing the body to decide what norms should be applicable is gender Further practises that come to be associated with sexes still are capable of acquiring status conferring status on the people associated with those practises

Feminism,1615584340,You are seriously reaching    This is a thread about  female only times at a gym and I am just saying why it would be preferable from my own experience If I was to go into a sauna I would feel more comfortable with other women as the one s at my gym are always full of men who obviously have a right to be there but it makes me feel uncomfortable to go into a confined space with multiple men who are strangers to me whilst wearing a bathing suit I can t relax or enjoy a facility like that I am not saying the men are going to rape me  seriously      where did you get that from   But that I would appreciate a women s only time slot

Feminism,1615607596,I don t necessarily think tampons should be free  at least not in the context of capitalism  I think they should be possible to obtain for free in some circumstances and settings and low cost otherwise just as condoms and toilet paper are Not having access to them is a health risk  and also limits the ability of women and girls  and trans guys NB folks who menstruate to participate in economic and social life It s also a cost that only people who menstruate have to bear and depending on an individual s cycle and budget that cost can be considerable I would like to see  single servings of basic models available for free in public institution restrooms like toilet paper and packs available for on request in particular circumstances like at schools universities food banks etc a bit like condoms 
Feminism,1615607018,I m from South America were tampon use is not widely extended amongst teenage and the most vulnerable women population But just as  RisingQueenx said poverty is the main reason why I think in my country s case period pads should be given for free to girls and menstruating women as has been said just like toilet paper soap and potable water is accessible for free in first world countries I recall during my early teens we used to ask amongst us classmates when we were on an emergency if anyone has a spare pad to give us We always share When you are a   year old girl in a Latin American country back in the early    s it was kind of taboo unfortunately We asked our teacher to had an emergency pack for those cases  I wonder about girls in places even less fortunate than us like some places in India  I recall the short film  Period End of sentence   and the middle East or some countries in South East Asia I think all menstruating women who struggle to afford their basic needs covered should get free period pads tampons  according to culture I guess  Now I know pads are damaging to environment but I hope we can come up with a solution that can be both friendly to young women s bodies and to our environment I think this should be paid by the state

Feminism,1615602785,Then would it not stand to reason to say the same about anyone who demonizes males in a completely unfounded or fabricated manner Or does that not fit in with your cognitive disconnect bias on this As someone who skirts the line of Feminism most days you all need to acknowledge that you have some pretty shitty double standards at times 
Feminism,1615602364,Period poverty Girls being unable to afford products so they skip school and miss out on education Same with adults A Canadian study found    of women have had to skip work due to period related issues such as not having products on hand Like think about it   its naturally to pee and poop so schools work and public places provide free toilet paper soap and water It s also natural for women to get their periods so why would products not be available for that too If it happened to men it most certainly would be free Free condoms are pretty accessible You can get a free prescription for viagra in many places Male safety and sexual pleasure is prioritised over women and something they never asked for but get every month Expensive It s another thing women have to pay for that is an unfair price Women get paid less for the same work have less opportunities for promotion etc etc etc And have to pay extra for most their products Thus making it easier for men to save up and get ahead afford more luxuries while women do not This is applied to more than just period products E g some athletes foot treatments are the exact same as womens thrush treatments However the thrush treatment is a lot more expensive because   it s for women Medical treatments women focused products hygiene period products are heavily overpriced because they re for women  pink tax

Feminism,1615599881,I agree I ve added a modifier to my statement trans women are a very diverse group of people with many body types and also might not have penises as well I used the statement because I was sensing gender essentialist rhetoric which excludes trans experiences Additionally the reasons trans women are targets are more complicated ranging from cis men feeling threatened by their attraction to them and feeling  tricked  and structural factors like homelessness brought upon by exclusion

Feminism,1615599052, you assign these things to  the patriarchy  which is just a round about way or saying you blame men and their oppressive ways for them It seems like a really convenient cop out anything that men are suffering from it s  the patriarchies fault Not like we as women perpetuate these cultural norms or anything right  I defined patriarchy as how it is defined in the dictionary A society that excludes women from power and disadvantages women over men in a systemic and cultural way We by definition do not fit that in the secular west I m not saying we have achieved perfect gender equality not at all But we  by definition do not live in a patriarchal society  If you need to revise the meanings of words to victimize yourself your ideology needs re examining  I don t really want to turn this into a  he vs she because if you compare the two worldwide women are still suffering more than men that cannot be denied And historically women have had their agency restricted as well But in the secular west we enjoy a litany of advantages over men and the fact that you have to ask  and are unaware of what they are shows that I was right and you haven t ever tried to empathize with men  Now this isn t to say we don t have disadvantages as well They work in different aspects  But since you asked ok You mentioned the draft Well not being drafted is a systemic law that we as women enjoy It s an advantage whether you want to blame men for it or not Our right to vote isn t predicated on the draft theirs is  You mentioned emotional unavailability Well that bleeds into my next point of male disposability Society views men s lives as expendable and women s lives as valuable Which is why we have had our agency so heavily restricted traditionally and why women have been oppressed worldwide in every culture Because if you completely objectify us it s clear that we are a valuable resource Perhaps THE most valuable The ability to give life Since men lack this ability their lives have been deemed completely expendable and this bleeds into every facet of our culture Violence against men is so normalized we never even think about it when we see it Can you name me a single movie that wasn t a horror film  because those by definition are supposed to horrify you that depicts women on the receiving end of the same kind of violence men are in The first  minutes of Saving Private Ryan Or any other of those fighting or war movies And when women are killed it s usually done off screen or in a less  excruciating manner  Female illnesses get more public awareness and funding then male Testicular prostate cancer gets    the funding breast cervical does  despite killing as many or more amounts of people  In countries states with unrestricted or highly liberal abortion laws we have more bodily autonomy Male infant circumcision an abhorrent practice is widely accepted and even perpetuated by women The circumcised penis is deemed  normal looking Female circumcision is recognized for what it is an abhorrent disgusting crime to commit against a non consenting infant  Being the presumed caregivers in divorce Insanely stacked divorce court against the non presumed caregiver which is almost always the father Especially if the father is the primary breadwinner he ends up more often then not paying for a house he doesn t get to live in and rarely if ever seeing his kids  Us Getting on average    of the sentence for the exact same crime as men Being      as likely to receive the death penalty for the exact same crime Living  years longer on average  We die at work at     the rate men do Public and post secondary education is leaving boys behind and using teaching models which have been proven to advantage women at the cost of boys This is clear in declining male education rates     of alimony is paid by men to women  Men make up    of domestic violence victims and    of non reciprocated domestic violence victims  where the victim isn t fighting back at all  yet not even   of shelters which are mostly woman run and funded accept them I dunno how you can blame that one on  patriarchy  Making up the majority of college acceptance graduates  scholarship recipients despite also making up the majority of enrolled students post secondary  Our blatant advantage in the dating market m especially if your young and pretty but being able to have companionship whenever we want it is something we take for granted And if you go further into this point it gets more blatant how much we control in dating We control sex we get to accept reject advances at our whim This may seem like a small thing but that s only because you have always had it To someone who has never had it it s invaluable  Our lives having inherent value by the nature of our birth See my point about male disposability  Being presumed the non aggressor in any confrontation between a man and ourselves  And lastly we have a complete monopoly on reproductive rights To the point where  no matter what we choose to do reproductively  it s how it goes down and the man has no choice but to go along with it He cannot opt out of parenthood  This point is so stacked in our favour that it s actually legal to commit paternity fraud You and I as women could hypothetically cheat on our partner get pregnant bear the baby and raise it as our partners and then get found out when the child grows and not only are we not criminally liable for the child but the man we did this too is still financially responsible for a child that isn t biologically his  it s also  completely legal in all   states to not tell the man you are pregnant and keep that mans biological child away from him   Baby trapping is also completely legal in all   states To the point where a woman can actually take a mans sperm from a condom impregnate herself even though he didn t consent to unprotected sex and then hold him financially responsible for the child When sleeping with women professional athletes are told to keep their used condoms for this very reason

Feminism,1615597820,A lot of the Pornhub related questions here have challenged my views towards sex work  I was initially     against the Trafficking Hub movement but people here have made me think twice  some of the  men are trash questions have made me think more about how harmful general statements can be and a few posts I have made myself got some interesting yet differing answers I feel like despite identifying strongly with feminism I ve learned from some discussions in this subreddit that the ideology has flaws but that s okay at the end of the day a lot of us have a different definition of what feminism is 
Feminism,1615597732,That changed my views about being a feminist Or changed my views on a topic inside feminism If so then probably I ve read many valuable things on here But nothing I can recall specifically 
Feminism,1615597687,It s probably more likely because humans are more socialized for killing each other  through warfare than raping Yes we consider rape a worse crime because women were long considered essentially the property of men and not to be sacrificed like men were are in war

Feminism,1615597277,Absolutely Finding and undoing internalized misogyny has been one of my biggest personal goals for a while
Feminism,1615597159,Here s what I can anecdotally say as a feminist aligned man Do not treat this like a test People aren t dumb and he picks up you re testing him to make sure he s  okay  that s a sure fire way to quickly lose their trust and possibly a best friend If he says does things that you find unsavory that is a reason in itself to stop being friends with him You don t need to try prod his psyche for where he might trip up and beyond that it can all too quickly become about proving your own views on the matter and about him than actually gauging his responses  the post a few weeks ago about guys giving a friend a bunch of scenarios when he called out another shared friend s as sexual assault the the flip side version of this   Treat like a discussion and if you think he has a questionable opinion on something  provided they don t cross a personal red line for you ask him why he thinks that try to clarify misconceptions and possibly try to gently nudge him in the right directly I can say personally that most guys don t want to hurt people but we might have learned bad lessons from the authority figures and peers in our lives that need to be unlearned  which is a long process in itself  Be careful not to treat that process as like a  pet project  though I know there are guys out there who are jaded towards feminists women because someone in their past treated them like a  problem needing fixing  If you want to discuss this stuff with him you could start with using a situation involving someone you and he are emotionally connected to like  I heard saw x say   sexist comment joke   catcall someone can you believe that   or  Y had a rough night out recently there was this guy who wouldn t leave her alone even when told him to  You even use yourself use an example from your life like being catcalled or when you felt like you were being followed or something By starting a conversation that s more personal you can then transition it into a discussion of harassment and consent One thing to note with the approach though is that personal connections do colour how we treat situations and he might say one thing with a generic example but act differently if he knows the attacker victim both You could also use big cases that appear in the news like the Sarah Everard one but that can be tricky as cases that are widely spoken also see alot of hot takes and can affect a person s responses Using examples where he might have not a formed an opinion yet are useful in grasping how he processes them and how he reaches the conclusions he does Hell if you even use  I was reading this book online recently and found out that   statistic    Cold statistics help avoid possible biases and can prevent a conversation being coloured by opinions of the people involved or prior reading which can lead to him answering in a more straightforward manner As I said previously though this can mean you get a sense of how he might act hypothetically but perhaps not in reality especially if he knows someone involved I don t there s any  right way to start this conversation  its a difficult and often personal topic and you know what approach to discussion works for him better than I ever could As to examples another  do not I would avoid is anything  conventional to get the most nuanced responses That s not to say you shouldn t use them as a jumping off point but most guys are going to say they support a victim if you say  x forced themselves on y  and you aren t going to learn much from that You might get a different response if you ask them about  z taking back some out their face drunk to their place  or  z bothering this person after being told now or  a grabbed slapped b s butt without asking  or even  a and b were having sex and b didn t seem to care when a felt like they wanted to stop  Likewise with harassment its easy for guys to say  catcalling is bad  but if you make a point about how someone harassed someone and no one helped particular if its a woman who s the victim with men as bystanders you might get a different response Non conventional scenarios make us question how we would react in those scenarios and often result in us understanding and verbalising our own views in a manner that more solid that just  sexual harassment assault is bad  I would also use a mix of genders People can and do act differently if it s  he on she vs  she on he  or  she on she vs  he on he  or with gender non conforming people   he she on they   etc I would try to insert these naturally as how he reacts to them will also give you an inkling into his views on gender stereotypes and LGBT people alongside his opinions of harassment and consent One thing I would also suggest possibly doing  but be careful in how you word it is ask if anyone in their life had ignored their consent or overstepped a boundary I know one of the most frank discussions I ve ever had with male friends is one guy saying  this girl in the club last week kept touching me and was being a bitch when I told to go away  not saying that s the best way he could of said just that s how he described it  I brought up how I d had guys grope me before similarly and said what they did was sexual harassment and even assault They all then came out with stories of men and women overstepping boundaries and coming the brutal realisation that  oh we ve all be sexually harassed or assaulted here  It was eye opening experience for all of us I would avoid alot of caution here though as it could lead to re living a traumatic experience they didn t want to talk about Sorry for the long comment hope anything I said can help 
Feminism,1615597106,capitalism also profits off of this and mostly men control the industries and have the most power so of course they wouldn t want to give up their privilege also the amount of people that don t realize they are sexist and misogynistic since its so normalized
Feminism,1615597096,I dont think they should exist Unless theres a mens only hour That just seems fair 
Feminism,1615597067,And when women don t wear makeup people comment on it either negative like or say something backhanded
Feminism,1615597055,There are plenty of good questions and many that help me refine my position but none that have outright rocked my world 
Feminism,1615596847,not all black people is used to fight a fake narrative that white people created black people are savage uneducated and shit to appear superior and justify their abuse and those stereotypes affect them even this days so a marginalized group fighting opression vs not all men that is used to silence women that speak on their struggles in society and changing the subject so the opressor silencing the opressed
Feminism,1615596562,in society there is a different treatmen to women an men women cant go out without being catcalled they get used to make products more desirable etc while men dont get that now that is important because it causes girls to get a huge ammount of attention because of how much they are viewed as objects and they cant leave that on the contrary men almost never get complimented or called beautiful because its deemed as unimportant to them that causes boys to generally like getting that  sexy object gets attention and thats also a problem on the catcalling thing because mens desire to be praised makes them think id like to get whistles on the street so they dont listen to women but this perception of men being desperate for sex and shit is also a problem bcs it makes people think men cant be sexually abused or that they should be grateful
Feminism,1615596483,Again even in America suffrage was restricted to most men like it was in other parts of the world Feminist simply want to rewrite history on this point to came a false oppression narrative Even today in some parts of the world men s civil rights are conditional on them signing up to fight in military combat Women never had similar obligations
Feminism,1615596171,Can I just ask a relevant question If we agree that men in general don t feel bothered as much as women with unoslicited nudes does that mean there  should be a double standard here In general should the discouragement we give towards men sending unsolicited nudes be  higher than to women sending unsolicited nudes 
Feminism,1615631007,Female animals are breeding machines until they re no longer  productive at which point they re slaughtered for low quality meat Cows have their babies taken away so we can use their milk instead Sows spend the majority of their lives in crates too small to even turn around in I know multiple feminists who are vegan for these reasons The only question is whether feminism extends to non human females and I m not knowledgeable enough to answer that

Feminism,1615630563,You literally said this  gt Personally I believe that this discourse the generalisation of men as a whole creates quite a dangerous and hostile ideology concerning the nature of men We are not all bad people and those that are it is not solely due to the fact they are male it is also due to the fact they are perverse individuals that often manipulate their physical advantages over women to gain power and dominance Talking all about the generalization of men and how all of you aren t bad people It s a typical   NotAllMen which is done to dismiss the struggles of women and to derail conversations like when it s about sexual assualt or the attitudes that men have over women as a whole and then derailing that conversation to make it everything about men rather than what women go through and reflecting on your attitudes 
Feminism,1615630116, gt all those supplements I don t use or need supplements I am not rich  I originally went vegetarian because I was broke and couldn t afford meat  Veganism is slightly more expensive than vegetarianism  because vegan milk is more expensive than cows milk but for me it hasn t been more expensive than eating meat It s probably been roughly the same cost for me eating vegan and eating meat   gt saying something like that you need to be a vegan to be a feminist sounds exclusionary Good thing I didn t say that then 
Feminism,1615629904, gt Now I m not going to attack people s feminism just because they are not vegan  gt I fully respect your choice to follow a vegan diet but saying something like that you need to be a vegan to be a feminist sounds exclusionary It feels like you re just trying to be victimised here
Feminism,1615629570,Yeah that s nice Vegan diet is not possible for everybody especially if you re not rich and be able to afford all those supplements but ofcourse people should have to freedom to able to eat whatever they want therefore also a vegan diet and I fully respect your choice to follow a vegan diet but saying something like that you need to be a vegan to be a feminist sounds exclusionary I want to be able to eat steak without the fear of getting lynched and also fully support the rights and liberation of women and therefore strongly oppose the patriarchy I don t see how they are mutually exclusive In the context of my country vegetarianism is often used to justify excluding people from usually marginalized groups from places like housing and to exert their sense of supremacy over others So looking at this further makes me dislike this imposed vegetarianism 
Feminism,1615629470,Do you mean how women say women should act and how men say men should act Because that s a pretty big spectrum right there 
Feminism,1615629293,Double standards aren t a good thing They ve brought about a lot of issues throughout history Especially in the face of women wanting jobs the right to vote and the right to have equality in all aspects of their life Which we STILL have issues with If anything I wished that they had never existed 
Feminism,1615629164,Not necessarily Veganism is economically infeasible and one has to be quite wealthy to get adequate nutrition from a vegan diet In fact Gujarat and Rajasthan  the most vegetarian states in India have the highest malnutrition and anaemia rates which affects the poorest the most and to be frank it is antithetical to the main aims of feminism for we don t want people to be discriminated on account of their gender either individually or systematically and veganism will merely enfeeble the poor 
Feminism,1615629148,A majority of men hold roles like police officers and security guards It s all a system of who is in which position And if someone is arguing that women who speak out against sexual assault are trying to ask for men s protection they re quite literally speaking out and making others more aware of what s going on Hopefully putting that particular person who committed the act behind bars It might also be good to bring up if men were to be sexually assaulted you hope that they go to the same length to protect themselves As they face entirely different obstacles 
Feminism,1615628942,For some people yes for others no The general consensus is treat living creatures with dignity and respect Which is a huge issue in the meat processing industry 
Feminism,1615628913,That person does not represent the sub s views You re falling into confirmation bias 
Feminism,1615628790,A double standard is conceptually understood as a bad thing isn t it It s not just treating people differently for similar situations Juvenile courts for example seem to be good thing even though their purpose is to treat people differently based on their age 
Feminism,1615628597,I work as a doctor and I love having some of the more difficult questions that are going to be asked beforehand Even though it is tempting to blame it on anxiety or stress or whatever seems to be the smartest solution I try my very best to always be honest about the things I do not know However that leads to the following problem usually If I don t know the questions that will be asked and then don t know the answer to the question I usually don t have the time to look it up or consult with more experienced colleagues during the booked hour So then I have to tell the patient that I will be reaching out later or tell them my findings in a next session If I had the questions beforehand then I could answer quicker better and more prepared So great way of doing that smart idea 
Feminism,1615628321,Take this for example Knife crime in London in the past couple of decades has been on the rise and the main perpetrators of these crimes have been black males So if I said that I fear black men when I walk around London because they might stab me what is the difference between that and what women say about men in general Men are the victims of violent crimes more often than women and therefore I have the right to be scared of knife crime  but does that also give me the right to make comments about black people that are the main perpetrators of such crimes in London Or on the other said there are men that often generalise all women due to the relationships they have had with women in the past Take for example the popularity of Juice Wrlds  all girls are the same or whatever It s fine for these men to have a mistrust of women in a romantic sense but is it fair for people like juice world to make songs that state all women are manipulative and emotionally immature 
Feminism,1615628196,Why does this sub seem like a such a battlefield for so many people People ask  admittedly simple and sometime dumb questions about Feminism  and hope to get a civil and intelligent answer It s not their fault for trying to learn more and ask questions 
Feminism,1615628031,Like I ve said in my post I m not trying to victimise men and I understand why women have a fear of men in general My issue is when you guys talk about men you don t merely generalise the threatening nature of men These comments often lead into others comments about men in relation to their opinions intellectual capacity appearance etc In what way is this rhetoric a rhetoric that aims to raise awareness about female victims through persecuting men as a whole useful 
Feminism,1615628027,So even though we want to be strong and independent men are still the ones with the majority of the power then when we require help from those in privileged positions we re deemed as not being feminist enough Put more women in power and we will rather ask them for help instead of the only people with the ability to help us  men   Don t even bother arguing against questions like that the men asking them won t care about the truth 
Feminism,1615627856,But the thing is I haven t said  not all men  I ve said the language feminists use can give the impression that they mean all men as was the case in things like the ACAB movement which can create dangerous and damaging opinions and relationships Responses like this do not help in this discussion whatsoever 
Feminism,1615627792,As long as you re examining the morals of either approach they do go hand in hand yes Don t abuse animals don t abuse women Technically you can be one without the other of course but you should definitely be both 
Feminism,1615627736,You are just hating on men not complaining about genuine issues at all People like you just make it harder for our cause to be taken seriously 
Feminism,1615627692,Nope you re not allowed to be toxic And also no you don t get to make decisions with regards to how I live myself 
Feminism,1615627615,Rape happens to men too but unfortunately  in my country men are the perpetrators of rape against men and women Men literally get laughed at when trying to report rape to the police while male on female rape isn t taken seriously enough male on male rape is taken even less seriously     Your sexism does not help the feminist cause at all Please rethink your prejudices you are only hurting us females by spreading incorrect information 
Feminism,1615627482,So I d argue that yes it is better to be both a feminist and a vegan I understand going vegan is going to varied levels of difficulty for different people and very many people will not be able to go full vegan any time soon I would say that the end goal should be veganism with a sense of  I ll still eat x and y because z for parts that are too hard I m basically just asking people to try their best  Now I m not going to attack people s feminism just because they are not vegan I tend to treat these things separately since it is just easier that way But for me I am vegan and feminist and a socialist and in support of BLM and in support of disability rights and LGBTQ rights for all the same reasons they seemed to be morally correct things to do 
Feminism,1615626565,You don t have to pander to anyone  I was looking more at the stereotype that Feminists hate men  which I do not think is true Then I see comments like this Reading about these men who are apparently  inconsiderate animals is not a great look 
Feminism,1615626431,I was already on my way becoming more socialist but discussions in this sub have really articulated arguments against capitalism really well For example of course I was aware of the unpaid labor that women do but simply put a society that doesn t pay women to bear children is inherently patriarchal Even with paid maternity leave from employers we are still miles away from fully compensating women for unpaid labor In other words I knew capitalism was problematic before but now I believe capitalism is inherently incompatible with feminism 
Feminism,1615626245,You don t know me and you haven t a clue what I do and what I don t in my private life Stop assuming things about me please  I saw bullshit I called the person out No being a woman or a victim doesn t give you a license to be a scumbag 
Feminism,1615625952,At my university there were some vegans that argued that animal agriculture exploits female animals  ex cows milk so not supporting that industry is feminist And on the flip side people who eat animal products are supporting the exploitation of female animals so they aren t good feminists  It s not a popular stance and I don t really agree with it but some people do 
Feminism,1615625479,So dissapointing how people like you come on this sub and are vehemently against  anti male sentiments  which are usually just women voicing their frustrations about mistreatment by men but are completely silent when it comes to the masses of anti women and anti feminist sentiments that are rife here and in the world 
Feminism,1615625460,I m just trying to be helpful here I ve seen a lot of people use this kind of language and it pushes people away 
Feminism,1615625212,don t you re not doing us a favour it s so exhausting to keep your rage within the boundaries of political correctness when men are ever ready to stop caring about your human rights if you offend them a little 
Feminism,1615625134,you don t need to type paragraphs out to attack my language what i wrote was an addendum to what i thought about the problem at hand not something i want op to say exactly jesus 
Feminism,1615625045,lol when a woman complains about genuine issues and you want to hyperfocus on her language maybe the problem here is your not caring about the issue to begin with 
Feminism,1615625029,I do not think this approach is effective Either they already agree with it and therefore won t change their mind at all Or they disagree in which case you push them further away Saying something like this makes it extreamly easy to be painted with the  all feminists hate men brush Optics matter If you attack someone s ideas outright they are just going to get defensive From my experience you really need to handhold people through things like this or else you can end up doing more harm than good    If you are trying to change someone s mind the words you say don t matter it s only the ones they hear if you say that what they hear is goin to be something along the lines of  Men can t be raped and all men are inconsiderate animals   Now you and I both know that s not what is being said here but that is what they will hear and that s what counts 
Feminism,1615624579, gt Things like  ladies nights at bars is not  It s less of a  here s a safe space for women and more  women are the product we re selling  Oops I would just assume these were gay 
Feminism,1615624408,Just a child throwing a tantrum is what you are  Look at me  I can insult men all I want  Fuck men they are trash      Nothing to see here just an entitled womanchild 
Feminism,1615624152,I mean I am no MRA but it s quite obvious that this sub  and some feminists in general exhibits anti cis male sentiment It s one of the primary reasons why I would never identify as a feminist but I do support women s rights nonetheless 
Feminism,1615624125,why do we have to pander to male feelings all the time i don t care enough for this 
Feminism,1615623017, gt either way would work without putting a strain on our relationship Once I got his response I would likely just tell him it was a test and he would understand Please stop dodging These are your words  what are you trying to do here 
Feminism,1615622720,So basically if someone is beating his girlfriend on the street you try to fight the guy but he pulls a knife on you and injures you but keeps beating his gf that means you ve been helping him since you did not stop violence happening in front of you 
Feminism,1615622614,Ideally double standards should never exist Every person should be treated only by how ethical they are tiwards others and not about how they look on the outside  gender race etc  The only examole that I can think off is positive discrimination  It is not ideal but it is a helpful tool to bring diserversity to certain areas like politics or science Eventually people will see that the diversity is normal and the p d wont be necessary 
Feminism,1615622562,I am repeatedly in awe of the ability of y all to handle bad faith or outright hostile  discussions   This is just the latest example and I wanted to take the opportunity to tell you that I learn just as much about feminism on this sub as I am learning about healthy reactions to unhealthy people Thank you 
Feminism,1615621769,Obviously In Turkey the government didn t suggest to segregate the sexes completely but to open a few women only universities And STILL there was a huge outrage because everyone knows it reinforces the idea that women and men cannot coexist together And in the end they stepped back  I m really amazed by how you guys in the West can t see the problem here I ve read all the comments and there is no single argument about how this would benefit feminism or bring social justice oh maybe because it wouldn t 
Feminism,1615621536, gt if men weren t inconsiderate animals to begin with That s not really a strong case for the whole Feminists don t hate men argument   Yeah I know they don t  but sheesh why are you making it so damn easy for the MRA s 
Feminism,1615621036,Lol no  my endocrinology is entirely female and I have to deal with things like breast cancer risk that is far more similar to cis women s and prostate cancer risk that is far lower than cis men s    The risks of HRT  risk such as VTE depending on what forms of estradiol dosing is used  and the target ranges and drugs used in HRT itself are all based on cis women s biology because feminising HRT is based on cis women s biology 
Feminism,1615620688, gt  The grudging admiration felt for the tomboy and the queasiness felt around a sissy boy point to the same thing the contempt in which women  or those who play a female role  are held   
Feminism,1615620336,People are invested in the cissexist heterosexist and patriarchal structures and norms that we re trying to break down This is fundamentally connected to capitalism  quality of life and safety  freedom from violence    This is especially true for people that benefit from these structures  especially cishet  rich white men and in some cases cis white women that make patriarchal bargains where the benefits of conformity to patriarchal expectations is deemed worth it  conservative cishet white women are an example      There are very real consequences for crossing the lines laid down by those structures They aren t always worth it and that is  in my view what is stopping a critical mass being present that can completely demolish patriarchy

Feminism,1615620090,you shouldn t say this generalizing is never a good thing 
Feminism,1615619868,It is a rhetorical device used to highlight that for huge proportions of women such a curfew already exists  de facto because of broad cultural attitudes towards gendered male violence and the disproportionate demand placed on women to adjust  their lifestyles to manage threats from men 
Feminism,1615619780,point out that stuff like rape and assault for the most part  only happen to women we wouldn t need protection and safety if men weren t inconsiderate animals to begin with 
Feminism,1615619693,I said  like a test  it is not a literal test I know his values and his stance on serious topics But his values and stance are different from his actions The ingrained misogyny he may not be aware he s doing Showing scenarios and asking what he d do is a way I thought up for us to get a discussion started about how he plays a part in all this We are close enough that presenting him with these concerns and questions I have will not put strain on our relationship He could give less of a fuck lol I could hand him a paper a literal test and grade it and he would think  alright this is normal for us

Feminism,1615617606,I haven t first hand experienced this specific thing in gyms   but it s not hard to imagine because that competitiveness is there  everywhere  Some people are just trying to live their life my guy   not everything is a darned competition and you don t have to continuously show off all the time
Feminism,1615617353,Minority groups are subject to bias based on the salient exemplar  wherein subjectivity is denied and everyone in a group is seen as a monolith in ways that majority groups are not   This bias often goes along with forms of marginalisation and are used to perpetuate and maintain systemic oppression This contributes to situations where people assume that  All Muslims are terrorists or that  All Black men are violent Where such stereotypes are deployed in an essentialising manner showing that it is in fact not true is of value    The problem with not all men is that we generally offer cishet men that subjectivity and recognise their individuality and we do not assume that all men are predators for example  so Not All Men is a refutation to an argument we aren t making As such it is a non sequitur whereas in the case of marginalised groups  which can be marginalised subgroups of  men   due to the biases involved it is a lot more relevant     There is also the broader question of power relationships and damaging stereotypes against minorities tend to contribute to their disempowerment in ways that stereotypes around majority groups simply do not 
Feminism,1615616915,Press them on why interdependence is supposedly a mark of weakness  it isn t  Then poke holes in whatever they pull out of their ass I d argue that when you are looking at traumatic experiences it takes a lot of strength and courage to be vulnerable and open about them  especially in the cultures we live in these days    Independence does not mean having no community dependent needs or a refusal to lean on others either     I m trans woman adjacent rather than a woman cis or trans myself but I have been sexually assaulted a couple of times and I don t recall asking for men s protection either  especially since in one of these cases the assailant was a man

Feminism,1615616573,Cultures are defined by norms  and feminism has long been open to criticising norms so I imagine  gendered cultures would fall into that realm quite comfortably    Whether a particular criticism of a set of norms  say associated with entire genders sexes or particular subcultures  like say Butch culture for example is itself bigoted or not depends on where that critique leads in terms of power and marginalisation in my view    There is no such thing as critiquing a sex in feminism  since thinking sexed attributes of bodies themselves are critique worthy seems to be dependent on sex essentialism and feminism tends to be quite anti essentialist be it Radical Feminism TM or queer feminism that builds on deconstruction of ideas around essences 
Feminism,1615616547,No one is suggesting that menstrual products should be free to all women all the time
Feminism,1615616394,Projection If women were actually as bad of drivers as many men claim they are women would be the ones paying more for car insurance Statistically men are actually worse drivers than women 
Feminism,1615616323,This is not a counterargument to what I say a gym is obviously not the same as a prison domestic violence shelter dorm room where you live and sleep Even so I wish none of these were segregated either In Denmark they have  gender mixed prisons   where they live more or less normal lives So it is possible if you decide to have humane prison conditions  Having segregated spaces doesn t mean that we have to accept the status quo as it is without trying to untangle the underlying problems and can t strive for the world we want to live in Creating more segregated spaces doesn t solve the sexism problem and everything that comes along with it but perpetuates the notion that  women should be the ones who protect themselves from men because men will harass women and there s nothing we can do about it

Feminism,1615644413,Warning I m a class A rambler this will probably be a long one First of all the fact that you have noticed this behavior about yourself and want to change it is the best first step you can take especially impressive to have this mindset at   years old You said that your gender is irrelevant but I think it s very relevant if you experience male privilege or not in this question I will assume you do The feelings of being resentful isn t uncommon at all infact I understand it To better explain I ll give you an example where I experienced similar feelings I m white and when I was younger I would have the same feelings when people of color would explain their experiences with white people I got defensive thinking  I would never say do that My friends wouldn t either etc  I realized pretty quickly how ignorant my response was Here are these people of color who have experienced racism their entire life trying to have an discussion about racism with white people  After reading all that my response was  But I don t do that   I understand how ignorant it is for me to be angry about generalization when they re talking about such a serious topic as racism To expect oppressed groups to stop generalizing when talking about discrimination is such a non issue The reason we do this is because we don t want to take accountability I ve never discriminated against a person of color but I ve definitely done it passively By saying  Not all X  I was minimizing the issue at hand By uncomfortably laughing when someone said a racist joke or being quiet when someone said the N word like it was any other word I was teaching the people around me that it s okay to behave like that Being a man it s hard and can even be shocking to hear women s stories about men and how they may resent men  But we can t keep tip toeing around the subject of discrimination After decades of discrimination women s voices and stories about sexism weigh more than men feeling uncomfortable After discriminating women for decades it s completely nonsense to expect women to also take care of men s issues which stems from a system men created to benefit men the patriarchy There isn t a magic pill you can take to understand the female perspective of sexism The only thing you can do is listen to women and understand the power of privilege You don t have to be a superhero that crushes the patriarchy every single day nobody can do that Like I said in my example earlier if you stop allowing  passive sexism in your everyday life that s a huge step Your question is hard because personally I think you ve already figured it out You understand how you feel and you understand that your feelings are an indicator to male fragility or machoculture and you re trying to change that

Feminism,1615642815,See the thing is those questions have no relationship to the hypothesised assumption I have made about black people that commit knife crime in London The crime committed is different so you re not going to ask the same questions about the relationship between killer and victim whatsoever To ask questions specifically related to sexual harassment in terms of knife crime is absolutely absurd What I have done is drawn a correlation between the two Men are victims to knife crime on a scale larger than women and the dominant perpetrator of knife crime in various areas of the UK are black people Women are victims of sexual harassment on a scale larger than men and the dominant perpetrator of sexual harassment are men Hence we have two things that are the same so why is it any different to draw the same conclusions about black people as there are about men The fact that you have said it s racist also implies that the comments made against men are sexist   
Feminism,1615642718,For me personally it s all interconnected I m a feminist because I believe in abolishing oppressive hierarchies and I m vegan because I similarly think our treatment of nonhuman animals is abhorrent and unjustified I also believe very strongly that we need to dramatically reduce our carbon emissions to create a better future and veganism  appears to be the best thing we can do to that end as individuals    With that said  as with other systemic issues and other abolitionist perspectives it s rarely as simple as just making the oppressive system disappear Just like the existing economic system in the US depends on patriarchy to survive  particularly the value created by unpaid domestic tasks  such that just abolishing those practices without restructuring things would create major issues around for example childcare much of the world s food system  especially in wealthier countries has created structures of dependence on animal exploitation So part of the task of animal liberation necessarily involves interrogating those structures working towards food justice and fighting the commodification of food  which we should instead work to produce together and distribute to all

Feminism,1615642530,I haven t noticed that before and I don t know any feminist who is against men s mental health support or tries to gaslight men The only cases I can think of is when men insert themselves into a conversation about women s or queer people s issues trying to make it about themselves or when they expect feminists to create a space for them instead of doing it themselves But even then the problem isn t men s mental health but derailing the conversation and feeling entitled to women s labor 
Feminism,1615642402,Well I believe why men are more likely to commit violence is because theyre socialised into it for most of their lives  I was wondering that given that women are now becoming more accustomed to positions where violence is an option  police officers soldiers and the increase in media portraying women as capable of violence  female led action movies along with a sense of retaliation if it could mean anything 
Feminism,1615642149,I haven t noticed this at all At least on askfeminists I see a lot of discussion of men s mental health suicide depression etc As for how to change it when men post asking what they can do to support feminism I tend to include male support groups on that list I think encouraging men to seek this kind of mutual support is really important in improving male mental health outcomes because many men find themselves pretty isolated

Feminism,1615642015,If you are asking why feminist activists don t advocate for better care of for men s mental health   the answer is that it is not the thing they are fighting for  Feminist activism is targetted at structural reforms in and around issues pertaining to the treatment of women and is often at times in allegiance with LGBTQ activism  Consider Why don t animal rights activists support male mental health The question is rather silly and should be obvious that isn t the issue they fight for In activism your best  pragmatic bet is usually too narrow the focus of your actions as that brings the best results You cannot simultaneously fight for every worthy cause a person and people are finite in their allotted time and capacity   They have to pick their fights or they d be stretched thin to the point of being able to do nothing If you are talking about feminists as individuals as opposed to activists many  including me are concerned with the mental health of men I think this issue should be taken seriously and that men have historically been unwilling to take care of their mental health Primarily because in a patriarchal society wherein the man must always be seen as strong they cannot afford to be seen as having problems with their mental health   If a man is seen as weak in a patriarchal society he will all too often become an object of ridicule That is the application of a little feminist theory to the question   More could be said easily

Feminism,1615641571,I think it s useful to clarify here that a popular definition of veganism in leftist vegan spaces is  A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude   as far as is possible and practicable   all forms of exploitation of and cruelty to animals for food clothing or any other purpose and by extension promotes the development and use of animal free alternatives for the benefit of humans animals and the environment  So a person who is in a food desert and doesn t have good access to vegetables but seeks to exclude animal products or access them in a less exploitative way  such as dumpster diving could still consider themselves vegan even if they need to supplement their diet with animal products Veganism as a movement especially liberal veganism can definitely have classist elements but I wanted to clarify because a lot of people aren t aware of how many leftist vegans work to incorporate anti classism and anti ableism into the definition I think people also underestimate how barring the food desert scenario and other considerations veganism can often be cheaper than non veganism I became vegan through my ex partner who went vegan as a homeless teenager

Feminism,1615640608,Black people and Muslims do face systemic racism and this results in racially motivated violence against them Again just because a news story drives women to recount times where they have felt unsafe or been targeted doesn t mean they think all men are doing these things Just that in the moment they don t know who does so they do certain things to make themselves feel safer If as a result of these stories men started routinely being targeted in public in the same way that black people and Muslims are then this would be a different conversation

Feminism,1615639574, gt Veganism is economically infeasible and one has to be quite wealthy to get adequate nutrition from a vegan diet This is false You can get all the protein you need from grains and legumes and it s definitely cheaper than a meat based diet Meat is expensive Ask any poor person Meat is an expensive luxury in most developing countries This is long established fact It takes WAY more resources to grow a cow from grains than to just eat those grains Chickens are somewhat more environmentally friendly but it s still more efficient and cheaper to just eat the grains If you want to buy loads of processed food in fancy packages then sure being vegan can be more expensive But that s certainly not a requirement to be vegan Rice and beans is vegan and is very cheap compared to meat You can even add very protein dense nuts and seeds and it will still be cheaper than a meat based diet

Feminism,1615638865, gt So if I said that I fear black men when I walk around London because they might stab me what is the difference between that and what women say about men in general Aside from the obvious racism  Have you ever had a black man openly admit to you that he d like to stab you Have you ever been told that it was probably a compliment if a black man told you he wanted to stab you Are you likely to be blamed if you are stabbed by a black man Is he likely to be apprehended tried and convicted for his violent assault on your person Are people likely to ask you why you were out in a place to be stabbed Are people likely to question what you did to draw the attention of this black man who stabbed you Are people likely to ask what you were wearing to attract the attention of the black man who stabbed you Are people likely to discredit your story of being stabbed by a black man based on your friendships with other black men If you were intoxicated are people likely to frame your intoxication as an irresponsibility in which your being stabbed by a black man is an inevitable outcome  Are people likely to assume that you were lying about being stabbed Are people likely to assume that you in fact invited this black man to stab you and simply regret the outcome because it didn t go as planned Are you likely to lose your friends and family because they don t believe you were stabbed by a black man Would your friends find it hard to believe you  because they ve never known a black man who stabbed anyone 
Feminism,1615638408,I don t see how feminist as a movement extends itself generally to non human females  Honestly saying veganism and feminina goes hand by hand it s kinda classist     If someone isn t a vegan it makes them less feminist Yeah I do think it s like this 
Feminism,1615637980,Not really I think there is a slight possibility here in the U S but your causal mechanism is wrong It s not enough to want to commit violence you have to be  competent in it which involves a degree of socialization and comfort with violence not afforded to women  For example you can see in U S data on  suicidal ideation attempts and completion   that women are more likely to think about or try suicide but less likely to kill themselves Men are much more likely to kill themselves and a lot of that is men s comfort and competence with guns  it s not like it s so much harder for a woman to obtain a gun in the US  The same is true of men s violence against others they are more competent because they have been socialized int it  So as U S society becomes more comfortable with the idea of women as soldiers and cops and other gun wielding occupations we can expect more women to become comfortable with guns and so more likely to use guns In which case we might see a rise in women committed violence but not solely women on men violence The female on male violence we do see won t be significantly political in the sense you have in mind if at all it will be women using violence in the same sorts of situations men do  And this is speculation but it seems to me the women most committed to the feminist movement will be least likely to join gun wielding professions  However much female on male violence increases we can expect a sharper rise for women s suicides  So no I don t think it s going to happen  Incidentally  lame is considered by many people  to be an ableist word   You might be using  insane a little too casually too 
Feminism,1615637479,I meant unintelligent  sorry Also in terms of men using  notallmen to derail discussions on sexual harassment I agree that this statement is true and I believe this is equally as damaging as the point I make   I think both sides of this debate are straying from the fundamental aim of the recent debates on sexual harassment to raise awareness about what sexual harassment is and how to prevent males from violating a woman s sanctity Both sides are using this debate to make comments on women men that are not explicitly linked or relevant to the discussion on male abuses of females and that is my concern 
Feminism,1615637179, gt am I just going insane over here Yes Like understand that overall men are the ones who perpetrate the most violence again women  and men and it has nothing to do with the  strained relationship between the genders   gt For example do you think the movement could grow more militant and possibly violent with more inaction from the systems No but it s a nice boogeyman to get people to be in favor of suppressing activism and progressive movements

Feminism,1615635761,Right but I said that because I was replying to someone who was making a ridiculous leap with zero evidence or logic applied Hitler being vegetarian doesn t mean vegetarians are somehow evil Some vegans being contradictory doesn t mean all vegans care more about animals than humans  You re right that many people are contradictory I have seen that many times already today

Feminism,1615635467,Personally I don t think so I think it s a complex issue because there is no such thing as ethical mass production of food whether it involves animal products or not Vegetables and fruit don t pick themselves and farm labor at scale is  rife with human rights abuse   Ethically produced food is expensive and it s doubtful that you could feed the planet with it It took the Haber Bosch process for agricultural output to reach current levels which has its  share of problems   Economic and environmental aspects  and having the entire world move away from it is no easy task There are a number of good reasons to keep consumption of meat low but the ethics of getting rid of meat  let alone other animal products entirely are a lot more complicated

Feminism,1615632752,Honestly I don t see women saying men need to protect them from rape unless you consider not raping someone protecting them from rape  Women have been fine setting up sexual assault crisis centers on their own working on changing police procedures around sexual assault investigations on their own etc   RAINN and MeToo were both founded by women  It s been women in law who have done the most work for sexual harassment and sexual assault laws  And if we are talking about police forces well   there are women in police departments and while that tends to be a very male dominated and macho field it s extremely hard to make the argument that it is that way because women demanded it  So I would ask why this person thinks women are expecting men to protect them  To me the evidence suggests that women are quite willing to try to protect themselves and each other they just want men to not make that protection more difficult

Feminism,1615654878,This is a great question   It s not an uncommon scenario and I think you ll get a variety of opinions on this For me the answer is kind of complicated Going by the quote  she feels no need to explore with other men  I certainly wouldn t consider it to be  as problematic because the man isn t imposing a view on who she can and cannot date on the basis of gender I would consider that a private personal decision about who she wants to pursue in a nonmonogamous relationship rather than an OPP where you have a  policy or agreement with your primary partner With that said I still think this can get dicey Part of this stems from my own experiences I m a bisexual woman aligned nonbinary person   I ve dated a few bisexual women who are in primary relationships with men or who have mostly only dated men Some of those relationships have been really positive in other situations I ve felt very strongly that I was not really being seen as a person but more as a novelty or a way for the person I was dating to validate her bisexuality and her attraction to women So in general I feel wary of people who are looking to date a certain gender for the  experience of it Dating a woman is not the same as dating a man but the experience of dating one man is also very different from the experience of dating another and the same goes for two different relationships with women Particularly in the bisexual community I think it s easy for a weird sort of fetishization of a specific gender to emerge If you look through bisexual meme pages you see a lot of memes like  Yes i m bisexual I m attracted to women because women are incredible and I m attracted to men because i love making bad choices  And I think that s something to challenge because it puts women on a weird pedestal  even as it also puts down men  Sorry that went a little off topic I guess ultimately I still think it s something to interrogate What does someone think they will get out of a relationship with a woman that is different Do they have unreasonable expectations of their potential partner etc But I think of it a little more positively than having a rule imposed by someone who doesn t take relationships with women seriously   By this I mean that I don t identify as a woman but my experiences in the world are generally similar to those of a woman because most people read me that way 
Feminism,1615654610, gt But however they don t contain all the essential amino acids but however that they can be done by combining it with rice or wheat making it a complete protein so you can t have them individually you would have to combine it with something You would need to have that right combination Your link shows that they do have all the essential amino acids though  all plants do Protein combing is a myth though The original author who started it retracted it on later books and the idea was popularized by Vogue magazine in the   s with no science supporting it Amino acids are very very easy to get  You could literally just eat potato s and get all of them  
Feminism,1615654423,Well   I would suggest that you continue that therapy Both for your marriage and for yourself 
Feminism,1615654398,I m not targeting any men    I get targeted by men I walk down the street get catcalled by a large group of strangers much larger than me go  ugh I hate men and you say  no not all men     Like thank you for completely ignoring the actual issue and making it all about you  I get what you re saying but you re coming off as a jerk Stop taking shit so personally and just do your fucking part That does not mean policing women s speech Idk why you expect us to be so nice all the time The patriarchy is not nice but you want us to say  some men please stop raping us We find it very non agreeable and would appreciate you stopping Xoxo NO It is up to you and your buddies to stand up to other men and make them stop hurting us When we say  men are rapists it s because men are standing by while we get raped You might not be doing it but I promise that you all are complicit in what is happening whether you mean to be or not and so that makes it ALL men s responsibility to stop it Same way all white people are complicit in White Supremacy Do I get mad when my black friends groan at the tv and say  ugh I hate white people  No Because I know they re not talking about me They re talking about the dominant group that is responsible for their oppression I am not white people I am a white person  You are not men You are a man So stop acting like a BABY
Feminism,1615654283,You never touch or have sex with your wife because you can t be sure if she s truly consenting 
Feminism,1615654189,I know it probably sounds stupid But this the conundrum This has actually been my answer to the problem regarding my wife 
Feminism,1615654116,I don t see why absolute consent can t exist If two  or more people enthusiastically agree to have sex with no coercion that would be absolute consent Just because the waters of consent can be murky sometimes doesn t mean that absolute consent is impossible 
Feminism,1615654098,No we can t but I don t know what the purpose is of this discussion If you really think you can t truly ever obtain consent because you can t read someone s mind you d just never have sex again 
Feminism,1615654083,I mean someone literally came here to ask for opinions on it so   
Feminism,1615654021,Understood but on your partner s end all they can ever know is that you are  saying so  We cannot truly know each other s minds 
Feminism,1615653775,I don t even know how to answer this I have absolutely been extremely enthusiastically consenting to sex many times 
Feminism,1615653729,Do you mean when I said  gt If you have the ability to not kill or abuse animals to eat it s definitely better to do so  gt At no point have I said that it s the ultimate objective decider of moral relativism  
Feminism,1615653612,I don t think it s inherently  feminist to make  or respect a choice Certainly I wouldn t criticize someone s choices within their relationship since I know from personal experience that relationships can get into pretty weird territory but I don t think this is relevant to feminism A feminist take could very well be  forgiving the cheating just because it was with a woman is disrespectful towards same sex attraction  even if the same feminist making this observation does not actually intervene in the relationship 
Feminism,1615653595,I hate to break this to you but this sort of thinking is what creates men that struggle to talk with women about these issues Talking about  fragile male egos  saying  you assholes etc stating how we can t even try to understand what you re going through does not help the situation Believe me I want to understand and I really would like to try and be part of the solution and not the problem But if women like yourself want to encourage more men to stop being  assholes  or at least to get more men to call out those that are being  assholes  stop using the phraseology of racists antisemites islamophobes sexists etc to belittle and target men If anything this does more to stray many further from the fundamental issue of sexual harassment as opposed to bringing men s attention to it  P S I am sorry for the harassment you have faced I too have been a victim at times but I know that is not as incessant and damaging towards males 
Feminism,1615653398,Baroness Jones is claiming that now but I m not buying it She was in the House of Lords when she suggested a  pm curfew for men I don t think it was a reply to a comment made by anyone else there and it isn t the place where people make ridiculous suggestions to counter ridiculous suggestions reported in the media She is a member of the Green Party who are pretty irrelevant in the UK so I think it might just be an ill conceived publicity stunt Politicians being politicians I feel sorry for Sarah s father boyfriend etc having to read things like that  before her death had even been confirmed and her mother and other female family  friends having to read the  advice to stay at home 
Feminism,1615653365,We are absolutely allowed to anonymously speculate about an anonymous relationship 
Feminism,1615653292,I think it can be hard not to assign moral values to food and diets when some food is farmed in an unethical way Again I understand each person will vary in what type of change they are willing or able to make but I still believe we should all at least try to do what we can 
Feminism,1615653125,Because there s no evidence to suggest in any way that it s likely 
Feminism,1615653107,I mean they literally agreed with me when I asked them if they thought not being vegan made you a bad person but sure I don t have a problem with vegans or veganism I have a problem with assigning moral value to food and diets 
Feminism,1615652980,I feel like you might be taking those statements out of context slightly This whole thing just keeps reminding me about the angry jack videos 
Feminism,1615652756,if everyone is okay with what s happening in the relationship the rest is literally none of our business
Feminism,1615652683,It is a branch of feminism that focuses on more subtle ways to combat sexism in which closing the wage gap preserving reproduction rights among other things 
Feminism,1615652669,It s not my job to demonstrate how they ve wronged me I m not here to educate men That never works Most men do not listen to us no matter how nice we are If they wanna ask me for recommendations on books to read and films to watch I can do that because that actually demonstrates an interest in learning But when I m talking about my experiences with sexual assault I m not looking for men s validation or support because they re the ones who hurt me EXCLUSIVELY Of all six of the people who have sexually abused me  I was trafficked as a child in case you were curious they were all men So maybe men should start doing most of the leg work Because you assholes are wearing me tf out and honestly I don t have much of an interest in protecting your fragile male egos anymore especially when men are only getting a small taste of what we go through every day Like for Christ s sake just be grateful you don t have to go through what we do and stop criticizing everything we do I m not even the type of person to make generalizations because I m Autistic and extremely literal but when guys like you open your mouths I m like  YES I HATE ALL MEN 
Feminism,1615652578,Don t care for it they need to be more ethical 
Feminism,1615652441,Yes the way I see it is let people do what they want and dress how they like without persecution for living your life different Let people be both men and women and those in between 
Feminism,1615652421,Those are pretty broad generalizations to draw about a group who have nothing in common other than  not being overtly angry at a vagina pic from someone who matched them on Tinder  
Feminism,1615652354,In what way is this dynamic different On both dynamics you have a set of perpetrators that you can t identify individually so you instead associate the crimes of a view with a majority group In both dynamics you also have victims that fear what members of these groups may do to them In what way is there major differences between the two 
Feminism,1615652328,I agree that people are often unnecessarily rude to vegans but I think it s that exact  moral superiority that annoys people I mean right here in this thread there s a person who compared  eating meat because you like it to  being a serial killer because you like murdering people  and then agreed that anyone who  isn t vegan is a bad person That shit is just unnecessary 
Feminism,1615652285,So I just went and looked more into the OPP and  I have some questions  if you wouldn t mind helping me out  I m trying to fully understand the issue I feel like I am at a disadvantage for really understanding because I am not fully immersed in the LGBT community I try to keep up but I don t always know  Let s say there s a heterosexual couple and the women recently decided she s bi She had grown up in a conservative home and never explored the female attracted side but he husband encourages her to express when she sees people she s attracted to  ie in movies and things   This turns into permission to test out her female attracted side Her male attracted side has already been explored and she has settled and enjoys her husband so she feels no need to explore with other men  Is this still oppressive ideas parading as something else  Can you have the set up where the woman can be with other women without it necessarily being spawned from those kind of  not real sex beliefs 
Feminism,1615652213,Seriously dude This subreddit is called  Ask  Feminists   not  Ask Reddit or  Ask Anyone with an Opinion About Feminism  People come here specifically seeking the opinions  of feminists  therefore it holds that only feminists have the right of direct reply Non feminists may participate in nested comments provided they do not break any other sub rules 
Feminism,1615652043,God this is exactly the reason why this stuff is an issue If you want to solve sexual harassment by making men uncomfortable instead of presenting arguments that build bridges between men and women that demonstrate to men how many of them have wronged women you will not achieve much This focus of a movement to make men uncomfortable as opposed to just trying to raise awareness about sexual harassment is absurd 
Feminism,1615652034,Sexual assault is one of the easiest crimes to get away with Easy enough where I saw Twitter thread from a rapist s perspective explaining how to get away with tape Not everyone is going to have their assault captured on multiple cctv cameras unless it s a blitz attack that happens outside in a big city like mine but that s if you re  lucky enough to have it captured Not everyone is  lucky to have multiple witnesses Want to know why Because rapists don t usually rape in front of other people unless those other people are partaking in it Some victims don t go to the hospital police immediately after for a myriad of reasons I run a statistically small chance believing a liar and it s a fact whether you want to accept it or not 
Feminism,1615651913,In my opinion your responses epitomise everything that is wrong about these discussions You and many other feminists are constantly going back to labelling every opinion on this topic as just a  notallmen post However as I have explained many times I am concerned about victims of sexual harassment and I believe that is the fundamental issue at hand But people use this as a pretext for the shaming of others for reasons not related to sexual harassment Also how is the generalisations about race women different to generalisations about men They are all concerned with a victim perpetrator relationship And the reason I am concerned about generalisations at this time is because of the fact victimhood should never EVER be seen as an excuse to belittle others for unrelated reasons no matter who is doing the generalising It is not a healthy way to start a movement and bring awareness to a central issue 
Feminism,1615651911,The socialization of male violence goes a lot deeper than that 
Feminism,1615651785,Interesting In the contexts I m familiar with  seperatism refers to essentially self segregating in general  i e woman only  communities  not just spaces and organizations  I suppose the word is being used differently by different groups 
Feminism,1615651635,No free thought got it I shall remove myself Thank you
Feminism,1615651616,Thanks    TBF I usually don t I have a lot of non vegan friends and family members who I love and do not consider to be bad people But people like to attack us so much for the tiniest thing I think I deserve to sometimes allow myself to be proud of the changes I have made to my lifestyle and diet for the sake of the environment and animal welfare 
Feminism,1615651093,Yeah don t preemptively announce that you re not trying to find out where someone lives if they haven t brought it up first that s just creepy and would make me think you were if it hadn t crossed my mind before
Feminism,1615651067,I don t think I ve ever met a vegan who openly admits they enjoy looking down on non vegans so uh kudos I guess 
Feminism,1615650905,TBF it seems pretty obvious to me that if it is reasonably possible for you to not cause harm to a sentient creature it is probably morally better to not cause harm than to cause harm I m not going to attack anyone or call anyone a bad person for causing the harm anyway because I don t think that that does anyone any good but I will enjoy the view from my moral high ground 
Feminism,1615650553,Having a fetish doesn t make you a bad person Cheating kind of does As long as everyone is happy the arrangement is fine The only slight issue is that all must remember that relationships involving two women are just as serious as those that involve a man and a woman So don t get into the  it s not cheating because it was another woman territory That doesn t mean that it s not ok to set a boundary that she won t have sex with other men but she will have sex with other women though But all parties need to think about why they find that acceptable For example if she is sexually attracted to women but not romantically attracted to women that is honest and as long as nobody objects go for it If it s because the boyfriend doesn t take relationships between two women seriously that s homophobic 
Feminism,1615649919,I don t think it is a bogeyman and is more an actual experience that the individual is having 
Feminism,1615649694,let s  a typo don t understand youe needless rage check your conscience at the door women unite

Feminism,1615649504,Fair enough on a per gram of protein basis lentils actually cost less than meat But however they don t contain  all   the essential amino acids but however that they can be done by combining it with rice or wheat making it a complete protein so you can t have them individually you would have to combine it with something You would need to have that right combination But for getting a high amount of protein with lentils it isn t easy to do that According to  this   nutrition source the amount of protein in one cup or    g of cooked lentils is     g with    kcals but however that isn t a small amount of lentils you would have to eat a lot of them To just even get like   g from it you would need to consume more than a pound of it along with something else so as to make it a complete protein further increasing the calories to get that For the lean cut of beef the  amount   protein in it is   g per    g with    kcals or about   g per    g and    kcals That s more than twice the amount for a slightly higher kcals while for beef you can get   g of protein for just eating slightly less than half a pound of it which is much easier to do If you re someone who wants to eat a lower calories diet but still wants atleast like    g of protein then getting it done using a vegan diet isn t easy there s too many carbs in lentils to let you get the high amount of protein in a lower amount of calories so you might require protein supplements which then costs a lot of money 
Feminism,1615649036,Actually I m speaking about Latin American feminism I said  I think most feminists HERE  meaning Latin America do practice separatism in some degree and the following statements between parentheses are examples of that I understand that it s not what US feminists think but it is here in Latin America 
Feminism,1615648957,Sure women doing all the work for dudes   That s not a new one 
Feminism,1615648848,Well she cheated  wrong He fetishizes them  wrong BUT if they are both happy I don t see no issue 
Feminism,1615648728,She messed up by cheating Maybe he does have a fetish or interest in watching woman on woman action And yeah it s a bit problematic that some guys fetishize female bisexuality But this couple seems to have come to an agreement  I ve also heard of the  one penis rule which as mentioned does not take into account pre op trans women  That said if I had friends with such an arrangement it s really none of my business  or anyone else s  If that s what makes them happy who am I to judge 
Feminism,1615648536, gt most feminists believe men shouldn t call themselves feminists Speak for yourself 
Feminism,1615648478,And my responses seem to show your opinion matters to me  Yet here we are
Feminism,1615648211,Not sure anyone is a  bad person but this isn t a healthy relationship  The BF might find this  sexy but he s on the outside looking in and will likely get hurt  If the GF actually cares cared about him she should cut ties for the same reason  So she can cheat but he can t  So much to digest here   all of it will give a stomach ache 
Feminism,1615647897,As a pansexual woman I would find both of their behaviors problematic  Hers for cheating while in a monogamous relationship and his for seeing her relationship with another woman as less valid threatening 
Feminism,1615647812,Haha well yes but that s not generally the  free tampons argument 
Feminism,1615647799,It is called that way here in Latin America For the  M demonstrations there is usually a strictly women only block which is called the  separatist block  for example  here    I get that in the US and other places you might have different meanings for that word but that s how we use it here 
Feminism,1615647495,Having women only spaces  and other safe spaces is not  separatism  
Feminism,1615647354,i mean I think they should and so should toilet paper and food and every other basic living necessity living should be free for everyone
Feminism,1615647314,I think the sad thing is whether Allen abused Dylan or Mia coached her either way she was abused as a child and that is really sad 
Feminism,1615647200,The  double standards people point out aren t double standards and honestly sometimes the things people say are just kind of dumb      Like the reason it s more ok for women to say they hate men compared to men saying they hate women is because the women who  hate men are usually at worst annoying the men are usually murderers and rapists 
Feminism,1615647081,when men feel genuine fear going outside because someone might kill you specifically because they re a man then I ll accept  not all men 
Feminism,1615647004,Yo that is so true That s the same thing I was thinking You re right and people don t see it like this but it is very problematic and can be terrible for a plethora of reasons 
Feminism,1615646957,For me the questions usually don t but the answers often do 
Feminism,1615646575,The gf is a bad person for cheating She just got lucky in not facing any consequences The bf is   maybe not bad per se  but kind of dumb for thinking with his penis Just because he finds it  hot doesn t change the fact that he is still in a relationship with a woman who lied to him and betrayed his trust It makes me think he doesn t care about women s minds or hearts at all only their bodies 
Feminism,1615646553,The people in this  arrangement might be content but the comments are right Both of these people are walking red flags and I wouldn t want to be friends with folks who cheat fetishize my sexuality who think that homosexual cheating relationships are somewhat more permissible than heterosexual ones that sex with women is implied to be inferior to sex with men  ah  and so on     I find these people distasteful and if more folks have this mentality it will soon become toxic for the lgbt community and for women who date men  probably already the case  
Feminism,1615646539,Separatist as in not having anything to do with men unless it can t be helped To be fair I think most feminists here do practice separatism in some degree  most feminists organizations I know are women only it s a common practice to ask men to refrain from attending feminist protests on March   most feminists believe men shouldn t call themselves feminists and so on  
Feminism,1615646381,I know   I ve been stared in the gyms for years My response is to look them back dead in the eye  Out on the streets much worse things happen to us but we never give up on going out and living our lives as we should In the end everyone is free to have or demand women only hours or spaces I think it radicalizes women as a gender and reinforces sexism and therefore I do not support it That s my take
Feminism,1615646182,Choice feminism is counterproductive Choices do not exist in a vacuum  comic  
Feminism,1615646174,A couple thoughts on this  If they wouldn t let him in if women are uncomfortable then it isn t truly trans inclusive It s just the only thing available for him   Saying  other ladies in the context of that last sentence makes it sound like you consider him as a lady from how it reads which I doubt is your intention or how you see him I just wanted to point that out because language and context is important and conveys more than surface level meaning especially with the subtle nuance in gender topics  Saying  this is understandable and following with a  but negates the initial statement Yes my views on this are valid So are your cousin s as another trans person In my original comment I even said that not every trans person will look at this the same If the only option is a women s time slot that is open to all trans people then we would have to be okay with that out of necessity What is better is an LGBTQ specific time slot but that isn t a common practice in gym settings so we are forced to accept women time slots or not I don t but your cousin is certainly within his right to make his own decision with that  I d be interested in hearing from your cousin first hand on this rather than someone speaking on his behalf I m sure if given the option of a women s safe space and a LGBTQ  safe space he d probably prefer the latter because then he doesn t run the risk of being shut out if women in the their dedicated space don t want him there 
Feminism,1615646083,I mean Yeah  If you have the ability to not kill or abuse animals to eat it s definitely better to do so  At no point have I said that it s the ultimate objective decided on moral relativism
Feminism,1615645959,What is acceptable and what isn t within a private relationship is the right and responsibility of those parties involved Whether shes s   and he s   isn t within your realm to decide comment on nor pass judgement In the    s it wasn t anyone s business of two gay men or lesbian women were in love In the    s it wasn t anyone s business if two people of different skin tones dated and married  People will choose for themselves what is and isn t for them  Choice It s truly the only unique thing we have that s absolutely our own 
Feminism,1615645856,That s also not just the definition used by leftist circles It s the definition used by the society that originally came up with the word 
Feminism,1615645832,I think labeling anyone a bad person over sex that is between adult humans who consent to it is being a bit harsh 
Feminism,1615645812,The answers by feminists to the questions often teach me things and make me rethink my stance Just like in all of reddit the real gold is in the comments 
Feminism,1615645811,How dare you assume anything about my friendship You don t know me Sorry if we dont sit around and talk about feminism for  years You obviously are taking some of what I say and not listening to the rest I explained why I want to ask Your right telling him after the fact is a bad choice of words I have since changed my mind on that I am not dodging anything What I m aiming at is to open up the conversation on his misogyny and toxic masculinity
Feminism,1615669266,i mixed up the links they were the other way around i also missed the page   stastistics which are a lot closer but in the UN report   is never mentioned and was just unsure where it had came from
Feminism,1615669039,Yeah I m sorry but the report isn t really all that  new for any femme person existing in public spaces I know all that stuff because I ve lived it It s great to see it on paper but it s literally all things women and feminism in particular have been demanding for ages
Feminism,1615669001,My anecdotal evidence and that of my friends would strongly support the high number of     I know it may look shockingly high but this just shows how wide spread this problem is 
Feminism,1615668991,just the way the artical is writen is taking somthing away from the stastitic  lying  was probbably a poor way of putting it
Feminism,1615668903,   its definitely way too many and I think it s a real issue id highly recommend reading the full un report its really interesting and talks about some suggestions  to fix the issue
Feminism,1615668683,What are you talking about The second paragraph in the article you claim says    says  gt Among women aged          said they had been sexually harassed while    of women of all ages said they had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces I don t get your problem 
Feminism,1615668403,If you have any follow up questions I ll try my best to answer   
Feminism,1615668368,I have to say is    that much better tho Like   sure things have to be reported accurately and if it s faulty that should be corrected  But    is still way too many people
Feminism,1615668365,I m with your ex MIL on this one It seems like you re trying to understand the idea so I ll explain it in a little more detail Breasts are not inherently sexual Why The only function of breasts is to feed babies They are often erogenous zones yes but so are ears and no one asks people to cover up their ears If you go to other countries  ex certain tribes in Africa women walk around topless and it s normal The only reason boys think they re  magical is because they are seen as taboo due to sexualization by men Also the idea of  exposing children to breasts doesn t make sense Most children breastfeed Again this goes back to the cultural taboo 
Feminism,1615668308,I am not saying this to be unkind but do you realise how hilarious it is that you  won t somebody think of the childrened women s breasts when they are literally for feeding children and most of us spend a significant portion of our early years with our faces attached to women s bare nappies 
Feminism,1615668091,I didn t write the articles so   I don t know Who are you accusing of lying 
Feminism,1615668084,I think the problem here is not the existence of absolute consent but the lack loss of trust between you and your wife And you re trying to address this by going into some elevated philosophical questioning instead of addressing the root cause of the problem Why does your wife doesn t want to have sex with you anymore  Maybe it s on you maybe it s on her it s probably both but nobody here can answer that for you What happened  What changed  What didn t  Why  Maybe she doesn t desire you anymore maybe she s not satisfied with you can you accept those thoughts  This subreddit is not your personnal therapist and that s what you need Also forcing somebody to do something they don t want to by scheduling it regularly and expecting them to enjoy it is the opposite of a solution 
Feminism,1615667583,Yes I see that now That makes much more sense Apologizes 
Feminism,1615666898,As I explained somewhere else in the thread we give the term  separatism a broader meaning 
Feminism,1615666839,Alright I ve decided to ask about the concept of  punching up vs punching down  A person of a priviliged group say men cannot make jokes about people of a oppressed group say women However the reverse is acceptable So when a privileged person is made fun of by an oppressed person they cannot make a joke about the oppressed in response  I admit this seems unfair to me as I didn t choose to be born in a priviliged group and I didn t choose to take on this role I m just supposed to take it and I can t do anything in response This probably also relates to my fragility 
Feminism,1615666780,I don t believe there is a spectrum of consent  There is a spectrum of  activities you can consent to and there is a spectrum of  clarity of communication  non verbal vs  OK vs  here is exactly what I do and do not want  But consent is either yes or no  It s either there or it isn t If it s not clear consent then you assume there is no consent Which is why it s not considered consent if the person is intoxicated or a minor Maybe under other circumstances they would still say yes but you can t know that so you have to treat it as a no It sounds like you objected to the lack of intimacy and connection because you want your wife to be enthusiastic   which is certainly reasonable And maybe she went along with your statement because she was relieved not to feel obligated But I don t think you ever had an issue of consent She consented however grudgingly I think you had more of a relationship issue 
Feminism,1615666116,Fair enough but the way OP phrased the question it sounds like  who did something wrong  and that was definitely her 
Feminism,1615666023,Cheating is a betrayal of trust However the boyfriend appears to have forgiven the girlfriend for that betrayal  They have come to a personal arrangement is none of anyone else s business 
Feminism,1615665890,I wouldn t say she is a bad person She made at least one bad choice but people are bigger than their worst moment 
Feminism,1615665733,Thanks this is one of the better explanations I ve seen 
Feminism,1615665690, The word  cheat was used so this is not a consensual scenario  initially  
Feminism,1615665319,I have done my own research Patriarchy was not created by men It was first established in smaller tribal units and men became dominant figures because of their physical superiority  in a world built on violence the more physical beings took hold of leadership  Patriarchal ideas were created and reasserted by men throughout history particularly in relation to religion  I also don t think the patriarchal system was designed to oppress women  as many academics agree It was a system designed so that every one in society was deemed to have a  proper place I m not saying that this was the right thing to do at all that s just the idea behind it I also do think the system has oppressed women but I don t think the initial intention of it was to suppress women  In terms of patriarchy today I m not entirely sure it exists There are ideas and beliefs that circulate that could exist under patriarchal structures but patriarchy doesn t really exist as a system nowadays in my opinion I know that you can say rape culture the wage gap etc are examples that  prove the existences patriarchal system but they just aren t Men are more often victims of violent crime more men are incarcerated most of the victims of war are men most people that are homeless are men and it can even be argued that men are more persecuted and disproportionately discriminated against in many things such as scholarships or job hiring Even in terms of economic dominance those in the very top are a group of extremely successful men that in no way represent men as a whole I don t think the sexist opinions of a minority men are sufficient to explain the existence of a patriarchy So yeah I sort of have done a bit of research I just asked for your own definition and you got defensive about it   
Feminism,1615665278,This is an interesting article It effectively argues men should be silent and to the side I wouldn t say it endorses separatism or men not calling themselves feminist  Still a good article though 
Feminism,1615664293,Enthusiastic consent exists just fine but it requires that you have a trust relationship so you and trust what they say and express You don t have that trust right now in fact you sound like you are having a trust crisis Anyone could lie to you about anything so how can you possibly trust their consent  I had one of those recently and it was rough That s definitely something to take up in therapy 
Feminism,1615664244,I would rather get men to not sexually assault and rape us It s funny how we even have to ask and then the ones that are  not all men can t even see that this isn t our problem to fix It s happening  to us  Do you want the world to be a fairer better world Then this is what is happening to all women around you Because of men Do something 
Feminism,1615664218,Oh yeah definitely I m not socially inept to the point where I thought it was a good idea I m just socially inept to the point I literally didn t know what else I could say 
Feminism,1615662596,Well your post ist primary example Why does a group call itself  Men s Right s Activist when they don t do anything to help vulnerable men but are exclusively ranting about mean feminists doing nothing Feminists acknowledge that many men are vulnerable and they are supporting gay men depressed men trans men assaulted men    Women s shelters exist because women volunteer donate and lobby for them They also exist because women usually don t own the home or can t pay the rent to throw their abusive partner out Nobody stops men to do the same Considering the wealth and power men hold overall this should be easy I wouldn t be surprised if there are more feminists knowing that there is an  International men s day and when it is than MRAs 
Feminism,1615662405,I think its bad He finds lesbian sex hot and thats the only reason he s allowing this There s a reason she cheated likely problems in the relationship which this isnt solving Cheating isnt right I feel in a good relationship if there are problems you try and solve them instead of going outside the relationship and if it cant work then end the relationship I know abuse exists but I believe in trying to get out before doing cheating 
Feminism,1615662269,So you are quite happy to obstruct a harmless paternity test so you can dodge the consequences of your infidelity 
Feminism,1615660808,Is there consent or is there lying Is there manipulation or enthusiasm That s pretty much it 
Feminism,1615660277,Cheating is complicated there are gray areas and various circumstances People will attack people for cheating so quickly  Not saying I m better or whatnot but it s something that should be heard out as to why Sadly   a lot of women have died when men found out the women found loving elsewhere And folks still attack those who are murdered just because they were in an affair  The boyfriend   it seems like hr s trying to control her sexuality by  allowing her only to sleep with women while being with him so that s not cool I see why she cheated 
Feminism,1615660268,Hang on what do you mean by  women being expected to do all the work for dudes   Can you explain please Thanks 
Feminism,1615660090,I have given some thought to the matter yes as most feminists in my continent have If you are interested in the Latin American perspective on this matter  this article offers a pretty good summary   
Feminism,1615660070,I think it s less about seeing that relationship as invalid non threatening and more about not seeing it as direct competition the same way he would someone of the same sex because when his gf sleeps with another woman his sexual role isn t being taken as sex with a woman is different from sex with a man meanwhile if she were to sleep with a man that would elicit more jealousy as there would be a greater fear of her replacing him with a  more preferable penis wielder a fear which isn t there with the woman  I m assuming these people are cis because I just don t think this exact situation would form the same way if any of them were trans speaking as a trans person who has been cheated on by my former trans partner 
Feminism,1615660005,I mean ya the women is a cheater and the boyfriend is gross for fetishizing bisexual women and wlw relationships but no harm no foul I suppose 
Feminism,1615659740,I can see how you would perceive it that way but to me it s more like men don t view women as a threat to their specific role in the relationship particularly sexually with a man they re concerned that that man will fulfill his own role better for her than he can but with the woman he views it as something different  which he s not exactly wrong about and therefore isn t as threatened because he doesn t feel directly replaced in the same he would if she were having sex with someone more like him 
Feminism,1615659587,I don t think men who are only okay with their gf sleeping with women instead of other men are inherently devaluing sex between women it s moreso that when their gf sleeps with another woman he doesn t feel that his specific role of penis wielder is being replaced she may be sleeping with someone else but she isn t riding someone else s dick  unless it s a trans girl in which case I suppose she might be  
Feminism,1615659579,Seeing as this has been cross posted to another sub with the intent to mock and brigade may I remind everyone that the top level comment rule is still in effect and those participating in brigade will  be immediately banned without discussion 
Feminism,1615659557,Have you considered that asking men no to attend feminist protests and not call them feminism may have and adverse effect on progress  We can t achieve gender equality unless both men and women are part of it Separatism seems like quite a poor solution 
Feminism,1615659461,Wow You cross posted this in another sub in order to mock other users How disappointing Enjoy your ban 
Feminism,1615659167,I disagree Is any animal that hunts to survive a hypocrite If you don t feed your housecat some form of meat I argue you re abusing or neglecting it  Now it s true we as humans have to be more accountable We have the brain power to understand and bodies that could adapt to an all vegan diet Does that obligate us to I don t think so For a few reasons   Best easiest source of necessary protein for the last few thousand years has been meat raised through farming or gathered by hunters We ve built entire cultures around that all over the world You really think it s ethical to go to every culture on earth and tell them to  stop eating the food your culture developed over centuries     if we all just stopped eating meat at this point   can we even imagine what the ecological impact would be What would happen to the tens of thousands of meat and dairy cows Would they all just die Would some survive Would they move into non native environments and cause havoc While I do blame humanity for its egregious interference in nature that doesn t mean I think we can just stop  We need a better less cruel system for sure That s what I m pushing for We need to coexist rather than dominate nature There s plenty of eco friendly ways  meat eaters can still live their lives I don t think it makes them hypocrites at all 
Feminism,1615659031,A lot of the double standards I see people complaining about are actually not the same situation at least not unless you overlook a lot of important factors and take it at the most pared down basic level If I judge a starving person who steals bread differently than a rich person who does the same that doesn t mean I have a double standard in favor of the poor though I m sure there are some rich people who would try to pretend otherwise 
Feminism,1615658985,oh good the privileged white woman is here to keep the latin american women in line I was nearly exposed to a different world view Thank you for saving me from that
Feminism,1615658962,Yes it is well known that meat  especially beef is a very wasteful food source However this is not necessarily true for other animal products such as milk or honey and it does not mean that you have to cut meat consumption entirely to zero either 
Feminism,1615658873,look live and let live the only thing that isn t okay is the cheating  as a woman who dated a bi guy and had talks about non monogamy with him  like I would have been okay with him sleeping with other men  safely but honestly wouldn t have felt as comfortable with him doing that with women  because I am a woman  and its like    well what am I not satisfying there what does she have that I don t But I wouldn t feel that way about a guy cause it s like   I m not in that category we aren t competing at all    like   people analyze shit too much if no one is bothered leave it alone  Don t tell me there s something wrong with the way I feel either okay 
Feminism,1615658787,I think we agree My point is it s the definition according to the people who came up with the word in the first place and generally accepted in and outside of leftist circles The exceptions are just those who don t know about the concept or its history like your example or the people on reddit who claim vegans can t use any oil products cause  a fraction of it comes from dinosaurs 
Feminism,1615658633,I thought  The Hitler Card    was reserved for places like Facebook 
Feminism,1615658528,We should let innocent beings suffer and stay quiet about it just because some people get their feelings hurt Got it 
Feminism,1615658373,A concept of absolute consent would imply that once given it could never be revoked You are correct that such a thing does not exist  there is not any scenario where someone before engaging in sexual or other activity with you could consent and be guaranteed to  never change their mind or their feelings about whatever occurs afterwards  whether there are subsequent sexual encounters the relationship progresses over time  or does not  or the own individuals feelings about the context in which they gave consent can be guaranteed not to change Your experiences as difficult and unfortunate as they are do not render whole cloth the  practice of asking or offering consent in itself meaningless or relevant however  Relationships are made up of many different components Along with sexual commitments  which should include and require consent   there are other commitments you make in regards to open and honest communication to sharing and honouring each other boundaries   etc etc It sounds like your marriage  and the relationship and commitments with your spouse began breaking down some time ago The primary issue between you and your wife is not a lack of enthusiastic consent in regards to sex with your partner scheduled or unscheduled  that is just the particular way the other ways your marriage has already lost trust respect and commitment manifesting  As to how can two people ever trust each other Relationships are about risk  you might mitigate risk by taking other actions outside of sex to build and affirm trust  like communicating offering reciprocity in aid and support etc But it s a fundamental part of the human condition that you can t ever truly know have power over or surety in regards to another person It sounds like you have some pre existing issues with trust in relationships and that your current relationship is also doing harm to your sense of confidence in both yourself and others  I cannot recommend getting solo therapy to deal with those issues with people who are trained to do so enough 
Feminism,1615658254,            But you can be offended by exploitation of    animals without being a vegan  But you can be a hypocrite       Fixed that for you 
Feminism,1615658169,Or an egg laying hen Some of the most abused animals in the industry 
Feminism,1615658160,Thanks for adding more context I will definitely check it out
Feminism,1615657857,I m not the commenter but have been learning more about nonmonogamy and grew up queer in a conservative home and city for the majority of my life  I think the issue the commenter above is talking about is that the man in the relationship is the one allowing his partner to only be with other women and this is after she had sex with someone else without his prior consent  cheating  This dynamic is not healthy Healthy relationships and partners are supposed to work as a team not have one snatch control while the other isn t looking or assert dominance to get control The need for control is a red flag that the relationship can get toxic and that s without exploring alternatives to monogamy It happens on queer spaces too and the perpetrator is significantly more likely to be a man even then Now in a relationship where a an mspec person wants to explore and grow in their sexuality if both parties agree on what the boundaries are and safety practices then it can be very rewarding It takes a lot of open communication scheduling and consideration  I recommend reading the Ethical Slut not just if you re curious about stepping outside of monogamy but also to get a different perspective and insight on relationships and sex 
Feminism,1615657646, gt is there any evidence that something like this has ever actually happened 
Feminism,1615657300,The society was created by a leftist circle and I promise you it is the definition most vegan circles use Maybe not the definition anti vegan circles use though which is really common in leftist spaces   amp  x   B The definition is popular so that white women on reddit don t use indigenous women  like me as an excuse for why they themselves can t go vegan 
Feminism,1615657105,Sure in the same way you can be a racist and still be a feminist Guess that s why intersectional feminism exists huh 
Feminism,1615656591,Yup Amino acids are very easy to get Your body actually stores excess to combine when it needs it so its very hard to be deficient Because literally all plants have all amino acids as long as you don t starve yourself or only eat bananas or something you ll always get enough 
Feminism,1615656532, gt In my opinion your responses epitomise everything that is wrong about these discussions You and many other feminists are constantly going back to labelling every opinion on this topic as just a  notallmen post However as I have explained many times That because literally that was your post about  gt I am concerned about victims of sexual harassment and I believe that is the fundamental issue at hand But people use this as a pretext for the shaming of others for reasons not related to sexual harassment When   gt Also how is the generalisations about race women different to generalisations about men They are all concerned with a victim perpetrator relationship That s because of power dynamics These statements coming from women and feminists about men have very different impacts and meanings due to that and the context of them is very different than compared to a man saying that about women 
Feminism,1615656435,That is something that wouldn t fly where I live  W Coast of United States  at least not in the major cities They would have to include trans people as well  My dad s gym in the suburbs used to have a   women s only area which was dirty and only included a few pieces of equipment I still used it for the stretching area which didn t exist in the main part of the gym but I felt like a  nd class citizen Ugh My biggest pet peeve about some gyms is when they do not have a dedicated stretching area or they have one but they also store other equipment in there like medicine balls I think many people of any gender would appreciate a space where they can get away from loud talking and grunting  But to your original question a women and trans only time might be complicated because there is no particular time that they work out as opposed to when men do Someone will always be upset because they can not go at the time that is convenient 
Feminism,1615656241,TIL Didn t know that That was interesting So you can actually have plant based protein without combining it with wheat and rice or anything else 
Feminism,1615656060,I m not teaching you shit Do your own research asshole
Feminism,1615656000,Think it s funny how you came here  asking a question when in reality you came to start an argument Thanks for making me hate men more  
Feminism,1615655975,Large scale agricultural definitely has issues but I think its misleading to imply veganism is equal in harm than non veganism in that regard  Most of our farmland and crops are grown to feed livestock   Veganism would actually reduce our amount of agriculture needed From Oxford  Specifically plant based diets reduce food s emissions by up to    depending where you live This reduction is not just in greenhouse gas emissions but also acidifying and eutrophying emissions which degrade terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems Freshwater withdrawals also fall by a quarter Perhaps most staggeringly we would require     billion hectares      less farmland  This would take pressure off the world s tropical forests and release land back to nature  says Joseph Poore     
Feminism,1615655965,Also please define what you think  patriarchy and how that exists This is also something I am interested in 
Feminism,1615655874,All men are not complicit in rape All white people are not complicit in white supremacy These comments are the exact same phraseology used by islamaphobes and racists and it is disgusting And if you had read the point I made about actually understanding my argument you would know that I don t want you to say  some men please stop raping us  I m fine with you guys fearing men as a whole What I don t want you to do is to go further in your comments about men in issues not linked to sexual harassment I e by calling men assholes saying we have fragile egos you are using the discussion on sexual harassment to make derogatory comments about all men for no reason whatsoever It s blatantly wrong And don t make this into a thing of me  policing women s speech  I m trying to ask for people to stop targeting and belittling others for things not linked to sexual harassment It s called asking people to stop being dicks and to start being careful in how they define others 
Feminism,1615655872,Thank you for the input I like to hear opinions of people with experiences other than mine so I appreciate you talking the time to explain  I can definitely see how this could be harmful to the other person  the one not in the couple and could come off as using them for the experience
Feminism,1615655845,Don t you think there s a big difference between a hard and fast curfew suggested by a lawmaker vs concerned people suggesting staying home for people who are scared It is absolutely not normalized to punish women for not staying inside after a certain time and that s what a curfew is 
Feminism,1615655673,The way I see it veganism is a choice Good on you But so long as we have cats and dogs as pets there s gonna be animal exploitation They need meats in their diet and not giving them what they need would also be abuse Now humans are indeed omnivorous and could survive and maybe even thrive on a vegan diet but that s never gonna be the norm By all means keep pushing it s a noble enough goal but it s not so simple as  stop farming animals  I don t agree with any big business meat factories I think if we invested more in individual farms we could grass feed healthier happier animals I also think it s possible to eat an animal and still show respect and compassion  I m kind of biased though Close friend of mine growing up was from a sect of Hinduism called Jainism They re vegan by religion But he never said to me  you and your lifestyle are wrong  But then I met some vegans in college Suffice it to say they soured me on the group  We re all products of the world we were born into Not being a vegan doesn t make anyone bad That s not to say veganism is bad but seriously stay outta my food I ve got my own beliefs 
Feminism,1615685571,This is why realizing I was bi after I came out as trans was tough for me I was polyamorous long before but I really didn t want to just use someone for testing especially as being demi would mean I d be basically risking friendships It worked out with someone who turned into an FWB but it really had me worried for a while 
Feminism,1615685564,What makes someone a good person in this instance Someone who chooses to act in good faith to help a person feel safe when they do not or someone who chooses to do nothing when they could do something that costs them literally nothing to help another person feel more safe in an unsafe world 
Feminism,1615685502,Isn t the function of breast feeding inherently sexual Like it s part of the reproductive process 
Feminism,1615685409,  Breasts are not inherently sexual Why The only function of breasts is to feed babies    Are you even a girl 
Feminism,1615685366,Every woman has an experience of being harassed by men Many experience this starting in childhood Women are socialized to experience this fear because of the high rates of sexual assault of which women are the primary targets Your friend is stuck in a victimization olympics with this argument of who has it worse and that misses the point If your friend does not care about women feeling safe what does that tell you about the character of your friend Is that really someone you want to call a friend Someone so devoid of compassion and empathy Who you associate with is a reflection of you and he is actively encouraging you to join him in that 
Feminism,1615685077,It s difficult to say without knowing him myself but it sounds like he doesn t feel like he should take responsibility for something that isn t his fault 
Feminism,1615684998,Ok  But does perceived safety match actual safety I think that s what he s trying to get at Like walking at night is safer as a woman than for a man yet women tend to report more fear Similar to how driving is more dangerous than flying but people are more scared of flying  Idk it s feels like he made a good point and idk how to respond 
Feminism,1615684871,When it comes to violent crime  he s absolutely right      gt According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics males experienced higher victimization rates than females for all types of violent crime except rape or other sexual assault Also the male on male crime rebuttal that I gave when he pointed that out seems to be problematic  But it just seems like common courtesy and doing nothing has the same effect 
Feminism,1615684762,I couldn t find the exact study but  there are statistics that show that men are more likely to be victims of violent crime    barring sexual assault  I ve heard people argue that this may be due to a false sense of security and not being socialized to expect threats literally everywhere they go like we do  
Feminism,1615684660,I d say he s a good person and has plenty of empathy But he did point out that feeling safe is not the same as actually being safe and I was kinda stumped by that distinction  I guess his point is as long as I m not harassing her she s safe I m not responsible for making her  feel safe 
Feminism,1615684573,I do it without giving much thought It s like holding the door open for someone It s just polite  But his question really stumped me because if I did nothing the person I m trying to make feel safe would still be just as safe 
Feminism,1615684481,That s still  no reason to have men locked up based on nothing more than    She said    We have a justice system built on the foundation of  Innocent until proven guilty for a reason   No one should  ever be sentenced for  any crime unless there s some kind of evidence Sometimes that evidence can be a video tape sometimes it can be DNA sometimes it can be impartial witnesses   But it should  never be the accusation alone that sees someone found guilty in a court of law 
Feminism,1615684480,As a vegetarian feminist and from the states you ve mentioned you ve hit the triple whammy of misinformation Comment 
Feminism,1615684472,Bathing together as a family in Japan just brought Totoro to mind for me  That s it 
Feminism,1615683862, gt For example gently kissing someones neck or ears or caressing someones can cause sexual arousal Well you don t cover your neck ears or lips when you go to the pool do you 
Feminism,1615683832, gt In response he asked me why should I care if women feel safe I dunno has he tried being a good person with actual empathy 
Feminism,1615683765,I wonder do you still not know why you do it Is it because you want to look polite or because you want to give others a feeling you would like to receive yourself Safety  Everyone has something they re afraid of so if it was in someone else s power to not enhance that fear in you by going slightly out of their way wouldn t you want them to Do unto others and all that lol
Feminism,1615683566,I mean it s true You don t  need to do anything But that doesn t mean that doing it isn t the considerate thing to do in the social milieu we live in The real question should be  why not What tangible harm does it bring anyone who chooses to do this 
Feminism,1615683429,From what I know it was originally used by black women to call out racist behaviour However it has been co opted by the misogynists to be a general derogatory term to be dumped on any woman who chooses to stand up for anything and isn t completely amiable in every way possible  so yes current mainstream usage is rather sexist 
Feminism,1615683058,I don t know if this really applies in social situations though OP didn t mention anything about working or applying yourself 
Feminism,1615682837,There are some obvious differences but not so much with the underlying feelings involved more so the way that things are built around us to drive fear into us and the way society responds as well as the specific ways in which people are affected black people don t come out of the closet so there is no hiding 
Feminism,1615682719,It s different due to the hate motivation I believe Both discriminate something that it s inherent of a group of people Both homophobes and racists are motivated by hatred and superiority complex 
Feminism,1615682628,Maybe it s like kiwi and bananas are different but they are both fruit Homophobia and racism are different flavors but at their base they are the same thing Hate ignorance and fear   So great to self examine I am trying to make sure I don t have any weird complexes as well 
Feminism,1615682575, gt He also pointed out that women are socialized to fear men even though it s statistically safer to be a woman than a man I d love to know how being a woman in this fucking society is safer than being a man  You answer appropriately It s common courtesy and common sense to not make people uncomfortable you can t teach him how to be a fucking decent person Some men clearly lack a heart and a brain 
Feminism,1615682381,Because every adult should feel safe going outside after dark and atm with the amount of rapes and assaults that go on against women they don t We really need to work on making town centres feel safe It s a psychological thing about showing you re not a threat 
Feminism,1615682260,I have a problem with it when it becomes a label that is given to any woman who says something a guy disagrees with in order to cast her as uptight or narrow minded which I have seen That s bullshit My understanding is that  Karen is not about all women it s about white women It fits into the ideas of Becky and Miss Anne and can be a commentary on white women using their relatively high ranking in the  white supremacist  patriarchy to abuse and oppress anyone who is not also a white woman or man Is this anti feminist I think that s a discussion that can t happen without examining the intersectionality of the brand of feminism in question There s an opportunity for a deeper discussion here as long as the term  Karen isn t just used as another bludgeon to silence women which I would agree is an anti feminist phenomenon 
Feminism,1615682236,That s a hard question to answer People in general are both good and bad Even the nicest person I know has been bad in situations I m a guy myself and if I really had to pick one gender for being nice over the other I d say women are nicer than men in general but there are both nice and bad people on both sides 
Feminism,1615682063,Pretty much it I try to avoid people especially at night while I m walking There s two reasons one is because I m socially anxious myself and the second is I myself look like a thug and I know people who don t know me feel scared when walking anywhere close to me I usually walk quite fast and it s not a big issue for me to just avoid people in general and go a little bit out of my way to keep distance between them and me Their perception of me can t change but then again they have every right to not feel safe in the fucked up world we live in 
Feminism,1615681973,I also couldn t agree more that whatever the status of breasts sexuality those attracted to breasts have no reason not to control themselves and not make such a big deal of it for Pete s sake I was a big boobed teen and getting  in those cases Men looking at my hoodie covered chest during every interaction is absolutely absurd To this day I dress in men s clothes because of societal body issues and it makes me furious now as an adult that we as a society would continue to cause those feelings whoever s fault it may be 
Feminism,1615681922, gt  Not exactly attractive overweight looks like your typical loser dude on the sofa and he doesn t even act that well  I m not that familiar with his work but I have seen him in publicity photos He seems to look like an average middle aged guy working a sedentary profession I think it s a bit harsh to call him a  typical loser dude  unless you consider the average guy to be a loser 
Feminism,1615681774,I d like to add that it s less helpful to focus on who is a bad person and in fact that feminism main goal is not deciding who is bad but what social structures exist to uphold patriarchy and who is harmed by it It gets painted as an attack and as men are bad and that s not really the story There are some excellent responses to your question in the thread 
Feminism,1615681389,I m definitely not saying men don t sexualize breasts But from my perspective I would say the people who sexualize breasts the most are the women I know  I m absolutely not saying that when a woman tries to look attractive in whatever way that she s automatically doing it for other people but of all the people I know the Ladies I know are the ones figuring out ways to make their breasts a sexy feature explicitly for others Contouring push up bras bra inserts water bras and actual breast surgeries that are cosmetic only  Again I don t think there is a single thing wrong if women want to do this but I do think that the people continuing and perpetuating the sexualization of breasts in the practical sense is SEEMINGLY women  I mean look at Victoria s Secret not much diversity and really not much size inclusion and I have only ever seen women in there as I walk by I don t have a comprehensive male perspective on this and I would definitely love it     On the subject of their practicality for breastfeeding only I believe human women are the only mammals that have very visible breasts outside of when they are lactating I m not sure how that can be used in arguments but it s a very very interesting subject 
Feminism,1615681065,I have   no clue what your point is You re saying that men sexualising breasts isnt the reason we can t be topless And then go on to make the point that the  real reason we can t be topless   is because young boys will sexualise our breasts     So you re making every single woman adapt their actions for the sake of a few immature boys who havent been taught to act appropriately around female breasts Do you not think that maybe allowing women to have their breasts out in public would work towards desexualising and normalising them so that boys don t see them as  magical  because they aren t magical they re ordinary secondary sex characteristics like facial hair  Also   idk where you live but in europe it s normal for both men and women to sunbathe topless and no one bats an eyelid 
Feminism,1615680674,Abridged origin In the roaring    s after WW and the spread of Ford s Model T car driving changed from a luxury to something increasingly accessible to the middle class When wealthy men or women displayed their wealth by owning a car that was considered fine When a middle class man went to work in his car that was considered fine But a middle class woman discovering new freedom in her car Can t have that that will both lower the prestige of car ownership and challenge the social norm of the stay at home wife And so those who didn t want either of the above but still wanted men to keep buying cars started this myth that women can t drive Even though women had been driving just fine before and after that 
Feminism,1615680658,i agree that person who i had in mind when i was typing this question seems to be very sensitive and unpleasant to be around 
Feminism,1615679841,I suppose as someone who spent a whole lot of my life predominantly around women I find them more approachable but I can t make any claims to niceness and virtue No individual human being can make that sort of judgement call IMO 
Feminism,1615679282,You want  little to do with women yet here you are offering your opinion in a sub about women s rights Huh  No need to reply to this comment I m a woman so you probably don t want to interact anyway right 
Feminism,1615679128,Tell your friend you don t know how to explain to him that he should care about other people 
Feminism,1615679018,No We have already covered this They answer both of your questions exactly 
Feminism,1615678994,That person hasn t met very many people or is perhaps extremely sensitive 
Feminism,1615678901,As a man I d be quite happy with this outcome I think the genders should separate as much as possible 
Feminism,1615678332,What s your first thought when someone says that nice people of a particular gender are a rarity
Feminism,1615678058,I think surveys should also mention how frequently it happens It s not like it s happening to women once When I was a waitress it was daily
Feminism,1615677955,I ve never heard someone make the comparison between men controlling their arousal and women controlling PMS but I love it Thank you
Feminism,1615677847,The topics might be covered in the wiki but it doesn t really answer my question I would appreciate it if you could approve my post in order to be able to debate about it and to understand the viewpoints of feminists better Thanks 
Feminism,1615677610,Please use the sidebar stickied post as we cover both of these topics on our wiki 
Feminism,1615677423,That s just plain wrong there are two genders It s called biology 
Feminism,1615676193,I thought this was in r askphilosophy when I first saw it This is the sort of thought experiment that s often used to tease out moral intuitions about consequentialism   specifically whether the girlfriend s  intentions matter in making a moral judgment about her actions or only their  in this case positive consequences or whether you think it is a problem that that she has benefitted from   moral luck    Personally I d say that her initial action of cheating was unethical for sure I think the boyfriend s differential attitude to her having extra relationship sex with women vs men is absolutely borne of societal misogyny but also his feelings are still his feelings If both of them are happy with the arrangement and she s being kind and caring to women she s seeing  and not trying to impose restrictions on who  they sleep with  I think the solution they come to is fine 
Feminism,1615675801,if these haven t been mentioned yet    A Promising Young Woman and  RuPaul s Drag Race 
Feminism,1615675130,The guns thing is interesting because in countries like the UK and Australia with extremely restrictive gun ownership you still see the strong disaparity in completion rates between men and women  and the availability of guns is just IMO a means to an end that fits men s attempts to find a permanent irreversible  way  of dying by suicide 
Feminism,1615674497,it really varies from feminist to feminist what they call it exactly for me it s bringing the patriarchy down
Feminism,1615674175,The woman is in my opinion the offender here Whilst the hypothetical guy didn t end up minding and let her do it again she still was unfaithful and should ve either not been unfaithful or discussed having something of an open relationship beforehand 
Feminism,1615673865,Wait aren t we saying the same thing Because I agree with you     
Feminism,1615673602,I think you two need to work on restoring trust and respect for each other before you worry about having sex Without trust there is no foundation to build a healthy relationship on 
Feminism,1615673587, gt dismatling the patriarchy and  gt harmony between the sexes are the same thing Not an either or 
Feminism,1615673437,I would disagree with this  Enthusiastic consent exists just fine but it s meant for new couples as a way to be ultra aware that they re not coercing or taking advantage of the other party  Once a relationship is well established sex does not need to have     enthusiastic consent all the time  But at that point you should have a level of communication and trust where you can be certain if they truly are consenting or not  If that level of trust is not there for you OP then yeah you should be revoking your own consent until it s back and you can be confident of her intentions The rest of it is more of a philosophical question than a feminist one   OP got a little lost in their own head I think and is really asking whether or not it s possible to completely trust someone to ever be completely honest with you  That s an understandable question too but I d rather keep ideas on consent specifically practical rather than philosophical 
Feminism,1615672857,Who made you video games gatekeeper dumbass    Also the only men who whine about women playing video games and harass them in game generally tend to be super bad at it themselves       Also galaxy brain thinking at equating FPS to video games  per se  
Feminism,1615672849,Women aren t the ones you hear screaming insults at each other for losing a game Go troll somewhere that people might put up with bullshit 
Feminism,1615672215,a The sexualisation is not intrinsic to body parts Note that in the same societies different parts get sexualised at different times and within different subcultures There are cultures where nudity and toplessness are completely normalised   the Victorians found ankles very arousing  and some people find feet arousing and I find nudity completely not arousing    b If what is sexually arousing is defined by whether you can give yourself certain neural responses then since people can get themselves off orgasms wouldn t be sexual or arousing  this absurdity should make you see the flaw in your logic     c Men sexualising breasts and having that institutionalised is  exactly why I cannot go topless I didn t have tits before I transitioned and now I do and them making them sexual and obscene is why I risk arrest in many parts of the world  They re just tits in most contexts 
Feminism,1615671718,A fascinating link to make is noticing that most cultures that made being topless illegal didn t do so until a religion enforced it   Another counterpoint a country that has communal public bathing Japan Women bathe naked with children Entire families bathe naked together There s nothing inherently sexual about the body it s about how you behave with your body or how others project their feelings about your body I grew up with family members frequently topless and I certainly was not traumatized by it Part of objectification is the mystification of it Ooo what s under the ladies blouse   Mystical magical breasts that we might get to touch if we get blessed What wondrous sights hidden from view When in reality as someone who goes to a women s only nude spa regularly breasts are pretty boring And I m sexually attracted to women They re just lumps of fat on the front of our chests They re lovely to play with but they re also no mystery Maybe young boys shouldn t be so ignorant of human biology 
Feminism,1615671578,No   I could imagine that feminist movements might become more demanding in the future and yes many women are angry at women who don t support women but this has never led to violence towards them 
Feminism,1615671540,If we grew up in an environment where breast aren t considered sexual and were out as much as male breast boys wouldn t freak out at a sight of female nipple Proof  look at countries where women s breast aren t a taboo 
Feminism,1615671250,I feel like the number is too low and the actual number is      A number of women are like me five years ago who though  come on I wasn t sexually harassed ever Boss demanding sex is sexual harassment I never experiences anything like that  What I did experience were men following me men exposing their genitalia men groping me on public transport men asking   year old me inappropriate questions men who were authority figures hugging me way too long and inappropriately men catcalling me men offering   year old me in school uniform a ride men kissing me without consent when I went to throw up on a train because I drank too much  I have multiple cases of full blown sexual assault yet my memory registered it as not a big deal and hilarious yet humiliating adventure  I think the truth is that     of women were sexually harassed and     of women were sexually assaulted I can t make up a situation where a woman isn t sexually harassed or assaulted even once in her entire life Maybe some wild child who lives with wolves and never seen people but I doubt she will be a participant in this questionnaire 
Feminism,1615670904,BDSM is an interesting one to explore there depending on what the partner was seeking it could easily be seen as entirely separate from their relationship or overlapping in ways that cross into the parts they feel should remain exclusive
Feminism,1615670830,the girlfriend didnt cheat because they guy gave her consent to be with the other girl the boyfriend is in the wrong for fetishising them 
Feminism,1615670628,The thing about breasts is that they re sexualized on women but they can be sexual for men to The only thing about a bigger chest on a woman is it is seen as scandelous Men are the ones who put this law into effect that women should hide their breasts and people don t teach children that breasts on women are normal If children are exposed to something from a young age that becomes their normal  There are some communities around the world that don t sexualize women s breasts and it is completely normal for them to go topless You have to look at certain things that men can do that women can t Taking off their shirt in a public setting being one of them 
Feminism,1615670565,Here s an exercise can you think of any part of your body that is treated the way we treat breasts  We don t usually choose to have breasts and they don t only show up when we re aroused When I m walking down the street going to work or at a beach with my kid or nursing a baby I m not being sexually suggestive Female bodies are not responsible for male reactions full stop men who have sexual thoughts about women are responsible for their own behavior and male children need to learn respect  You can think all the dirty thoughts you want about the breasts around you that s fine But that s a choice you are making I also love women and their bodies sexually  somehow I don t have an issue with nude breasts in public Just like people who menstruate learn to manage those symptoms people with higher testosterone are responsible for managing their own emotions 
Feminism,1615670455,Young boys have to be taught not to  objectivie women but you are basically objectifying women here Okay then 
Feminism,1615670359,Feminism is for equality usually that means getting rid of stereotypes standing up for people when they are wronged and really looking into systems and traditions that are damaging Whatever the outcome is is better than what we ve got now 
Feminism,1615670214,I think all around it s a pretty nasty scenario Firstly with the breaking of trust in a relationship Cheating is something that is important usually if it happens once then it happens again The woman cheating isn t alright but the boyfriend finding out then finding it  hot is pretty messed up too Not only is it fetishizing a relationship between two women It s also pretty clearly stating that he finds a woman less threatening than a man So he sees women s relationships as both  hot and not as valid as that of a man and woman Not to mention the other woman stayed when she found out that she was being used as a side partner and being sexualized People can do what they want but that is a whole bundle of issues I don t want anything to do with if it s real Yikes 
Feminism,1615669872,Thanks for responding and the clarity it makes sence It is hard to wrap my head arround it but this is something i can work with I really apreciate it 
Feminism,1615669819,The fundamentals of consent are broadly   Capacity of the person giving consent the person should be of sound mind not drunk high to the point of no control they should be old enough to give consent and they should be in a physical state to give consent whether verbal or by gestures   The mode of consent while it can be both gestures verbal it s important that the consent is fundamentally express i e given by their own volition it should be complete and not conditional   The consent should be free there should be no coercion manipulation fraud undue influence of power position mistake or misrepresentation in the way consent has been obtained There should be a meeting of the minds so to speak Every person involved should know clearly what is being consented and it should have no such coercive tactics in play making the consent free and absolute Sometimes the conditions can be such that although a person does not expressly say a verbal  no  due to influence power dynamics sexual dynamics personal history trauma etc it does not amount to a  yes either   Enthusiastic consent is term that is basically used to imply that instead of looking for a simple lack of  no there should be a presense of  yes  whether it is verbal or by gestures like positive body language When there is power imbalance coercion etc there will most likely be no express verbal consent and no positive gestural consent via body language emotional display etc While it s true people may not completely trust or even know each other consent on its own has nothing to do their interpersonal relationships history or even future Consent should not be seen has a reflection of people s lives or relationships as a whole consent should be seen as a fundamental part in every single sexual act that any people engage in whether they have known each other for one day or one entire lifetime So yes absolute consent exists 
Feminism,1615669670,They appear to be getting the    from the UN women s website which says   Only   of women aged      said they had not experienced sexual harassment  I can t find this figure after skimming the report but I believe the    figure is from asking women  have you experienced sexual harassment in a   public place   So I m assuming the    figure is from asking women  have you experienced sexual harassment   at all    although I admittedly cannot find this data in their report 
Feminism,1615693149,I see it like this  It seems like the best argument is politeness I care about being polite and putting people around me at a little bit of ease while also balancing my own ability to express and assert myself  I wont change my behavior because I think it s polite He doesn t care about politeness and putting people at ease I don t think that makes him a bad person since he s never actually assault anyone or harmed anyone  But he is my friend so I am a bit biased 
Feminism,1615693109,I m guessing that bison is the  friend from his story he is doing nothing but defending his  friend s bad behavior 
Feminism,1615693072,I think it is misogyny and anti feminist It s clearly aimed at women and it s clearly meant to shut them up There is nothing more patriarchal than shutting up women 
Feminism,1615692956,He IS a danger if he s spreading his bigotry and refusing to treat others as human beings of value What he does makes others justify their own bigotry and ignorance 
Feminism,1615692954,If my friends were in the situation I would stay out of it and not judge them Obviously the cheating woman confessed and the boyfriend forgave her and they are both happy Also I am bisexual and to be honest there is something different about sleeping with a man versus sleeping with a woman as it appeals to different parts of me and my sexuality I m not trying to say that cheating is OK but that instead people may perceive their own sexual experiences with men or women differently and I m not going to claim that the boyfriend is fetishizing because of it 
Feminism,1615692884,Tell me how you see it then because from your comments I think you are making a lot of excuses for him because he s your friend Simply because he s a friend to you doesn t make him a good person You need to be real with yourself on that 
Feminism,1615692747,Nah he s been my best friend since I was like  and we re really really close I ll call him out but dropping is extreme 
Feminism,1615692697,Plus they forget to mention that those men are victims of other men Most crimes against men and women are committed by MEN    Any time I hear someone using that argument it s always used as a justification of that person s bigotry 
Feminism,1615692696,Nobody  at least not in this thread is asking him to apologize 
Feminism,1615692694, gt Yeah I imagine nothing will convince him because he s self centered and isn t a feminist And a lot of women do get professional help that doesn t change the perceived sense of danger especially when we ve been told all our lives to change our behavior to be safe Don t drink too much don t wear revealing clothes don t be out late etc We hear that from childhood on throughout our lives and when women experience violence they are often blamed for it If he can t wrap his brain around that he s probably a lost cause I wouldn t want to be friends with someone like that I think this is an interesting case If we stop telling women to fear men in order to be safe would the fear go away  It seems like the fear is based in perceived extent of harm  fear of escalation violence and impact  rather than the frequency So even if it almost never happened the perceived fear would likely not change Like the driving vs airplane analogy Deaths from driving are more frequent but if you get into a car crash some people might survive An airplane crashes less frequently but when it does it s catastrophic  Sorry if this is an insensitive way of thinking It s just something I m curious about 
Feminism,1615692575,If I m honest he doesn t sound like a nice person He sounds like a person who is good to people he likes He clearly doesn t give a crap about how he affects other people aka women strangers 
Feminism,1615692349,Sounds like your friend is quite the sexist and is unwilling to educate himself about the oppression and discrimination women have had to face he has no empathy to even think of someone else besides himself and people like him  misogynists     Some people will insist on defending their bigotry no matter what and it s not worth the effort His comments like  statistically safer to be a woman than a man is proof of this Most crimes perpetrated against women are by men and most crimes perpetrated against men are by men That s statistically correct Throughout history men have oppressed and made women feel unsafe hell until a couple of decades ago it was still legal to rape your wife and still is legal in some countries Women have so much to be afraid of thanks to men yet your friend feels that as a male he has no responsibility to help rectify the wrongs of the past   Drop this friend he s not worth your time Rather make friends with good people who care about others People who fight against sexism racism homophobia etc This friend of yours is so ignorant and against treating others with kindness just imagine how badly he will treat you when you need help You don t need to keep trash like that around 
Feminism,1615691890,I don t count catcalling as sexual assault either I m certainly not saying catcalling is as bad as mugging My point was that I have no way to know which catcaller will escalate to something more And the original question was about why men should care Catcalling is already unpleasant and disrespectful on its own even if I could be sure that s all it is Things don t have to be life or death to provoke bad feelings and if you have any empathy at all you might care about that 
Feminism,1615691768,You know there exists a kind of bisexuality where one seeks romance from lets say men and sexual feelings from women In this kind of situation it s totally understandable that men are seen as threats because they might replace the husband but women are not because the wife doesn t find women attractive in a romantic way 
Feminism,1615691527,Look up Emmet Till Not too long ago if you were a young Black man who didn t bow his head and look down when passing a white woman you could wind up at the bottom of a river When your very existence makes someone uncomfortable what do you do Just die   Look up the Tulsa race massacre Because white women didn t feel safe  after an alleged r pe by a Black man on a white woman  a whole thriving Black community was bombed and hundreds of people killed their bodies thrown into the river   Why do we fear the man and not those who lynch him 
Feminism,1615691291,Yeah I imagine nothing will convince him because he s self centered and isn t a feminist  And a lot of women do get professional help that doesn t change the perceived sense of danger especially when we ve been told all our lives to change our behavior to be safe Don t drink too much don t wear revealing clothes don t be out late etc We hear that from childhood on throughout our lives and when women experience violence they are often blamed for it  If he can t wrap his brain around that he s probably a lost cause I wouldn t want to be friends with someone like that 
Feminism,1615691225,It s a shit world we live in if men need to start apologizing for perfectly normal and neutral stuff like walking on a street 
Feminism,1615691052,Sexual assault is such a broad category it s not correct to compare everything from catcalling to rape against mugging 
Feminism,1615691005,Other people have already covered that it s the kind and caring thing to do  and if you have to explain why kind and caring and good traits then your friend has serious issues but I want to touch on your male privilege  You benefit from being  and presenting as cis men It s this privilege that allows your friend to be so selfish  he genuinely feels he is entitled to live his life like that without actively working towards improving the quality of life for others  By taking action and consciously making space for women to feel safe you are contesting that privilege extending your empathy muscles and showing that you value women s feelings and recognise their reality These are all valuable traits especially because it means you have to go back on the conditioning we receive to isolate men and women  from both themselves and each other   So thank you for taking the time to consider both how women feel and how your presence  as well intentioned as one may be could affect them and or their sense of safety Your friend is being selfish and short sighted and by refusing to take accountability for his privilege he is further contributing to a culture that intimidates and dismisses women 
Feminism,1615690990,The reason people generally write trans women with a space between  trans and  women is that  trans is an adjective describing  women  like saying  tall women or  blonde women  Trans women are women 
Feminism,1615690981,Not only is it common courtesy but there s a ton of studies about how when everyone feels safe and able to share their voice then companies communities thrive It s long and I don t have the sources atm  I m on mobile but it s a pretty interesting argument It s the same reason why I care about the education of the people I ve never met or why third world countries deserve clean water food education and better lives We care about other people because when one of us thrives we all thrive 
Feminism,1615690885,Are you implying that rape and violence are getting more common Source please 
Feminism,1615690702,Oh ok good answer It won t convince him because he believes it not his fault women have this fear He believes that they should seek professional help if they have this fear 
Feminism,1615690672,Did you not frame his view as  why should I care how she feels  
Feminism,1615690650,I said   I   I didn t say a thing about men not being victims of assault such as rape and sexual harassment  I fail to see how men in the daily basis fear rape as women do Fear being sexually harassed and being catcalled as women do Fear being blame for their own assault as women do But although I  fail to see I don t claim it as the ultimate truth 
Feminism,1615690570,Do you only ever do things if they entirely benefit you Do you think the few seconds you re sacrificing add up to anything substantial  Check your phone See if you ve gotten an email or a text That s literally enough time to create significant distance You re gonna do it at some point anyway  When you think about it for a minute it really isn t a big ask So just do it 
Feminism,1615690419,Or you could stop for   seconds to check your phone to let her move ahead which is my husband s move  A few seconds is not a cost and your other comment about it not directly benefitting you makes me wonder what is your intention with it anyway With that statement it sounds like you do this for  nice guy points and not because you genuinely care about the women s perceived sense of safety Maybe that s why you can t come up with a solid response to your friend  amp  x   B At the end of the day we are a community of people To be good people we do things that benefit others not because it benefits us but because it is a good thing to do especially when it costs you nothing or next to nothing  amp  x   B Speaking as a therapist perceived safety is a very real experience that affects mental health Women live in a state of toxic stress and hypervigilance If you can take   seconds to help lessen that you are providing a net positive benefit for your community If you are hung up on yourself then you are selfish 
Feminism,1615690407,Guess you can t really do much with someone who s perspective is  why should I give a fuck about others  
Feminism,1615690297,Lol I think he would disagree  But      I dont think I ll be able to change his mind with any of these arguments
Feminism,1615690244,Men also fear their bodies being violated  Your comment framed it as being  getting groped or raped vs getting robbed and that s a  massive oversimplification of male victimization 
Feminism,1615690185,I can definitely understand that but I m concerned about the fact that he s arguing with you on this As a woman it s not sounding reassuring Lol 
Feminism,1615690098,He s a pretty cool guy But he s pretty goal oriented and focused so doing these things don t really occur to him 
Feminism,1615690050,The stats did not exclude sexual assault and rape It just said that that s the only type of crime that are have higher female victimization than male   gt The part of you pointed sums perfectly the different between being a man and a woman in society  gt Woman fear for their bodies being assaulted groped and raped way more than they care about being robbed I d rather be robbed      times than be groped and abused Your friend clearly lacks knowledge on the context of this data and what they represent The problem is that getting robbed is not the online crime outside of sexual assault and rape So this argument isn t very good 
Feminism,1615690011,Fair enough on the sociopath remark consider it retracted I was debating including it Time and effort to make others feel safe and comfortable is no real cost at all as far as I m concerned 
Feminism,1615689920,Ye not a big fan of throwing around words like that because it demonizes those who are actually diagnosed with sociopathy  He said that it would cost him time and effort to do that he sees no real benefit in doing  Idk don t think I can change his mind
Feminism,1615689880,Margaret Atwood did say she didnt write anything in it that hasnt happened at some point 
Feminism,1615689829,   Your own comment man The link you gave and quoted shows that the stats  excluded sexual assault and rape 
Feminism,1615689821,I suppose that s the more tactful way to put it but I don t have much patience for guys like that Good luck 
Feminism,1615689747,Ok I see But yeah I won t say it s a decent person thing I ll just tell him it s a matter of being nice 
Feminism,1615689745,Whenever I hear arguments in favour of covering up the human body because  insert body part is inherently sexual I think of three things First no body part is inherently sexual even sexual organs They are sexual in a sexual setting but outside of that they are just another body part Is washing your genitals sexual Not unless you make it Peeing Not unless you are a into that and b it s already a sexual situation Is scratching your genitals because they itch sexual Nope sometimes they just itch Teenagers get hardons out of nowhere in public in the middle of the day and that s not even sexual It just happens Puritanical views if the body has reduced them to their sexual function but they are not solely sexual They become sexual Second I think of nudism People are literally fully naked in front of each other all day and it s not a constant orgy and children are not scarred by seeing naked people around them Nudist colonies are only awkward if people make it sexual  i e creeps  Not to say it is impossible for nudism to be problematic but in and of itself being naked isn t even sexual It s hiding bodies that make them so enticing when they are revealed And I m saying that as someone who does not partake in that lifestyle at all And third can men s nipples be sexual They can be A LOT of men like their nipples played with during intimacy yet we don t freak out over men s nipples Ask yourself this question why can men s breasts sometimes be sexual but women s breast are seen as always sexual 
Feminism,1615689706,Your friend sounds kind of sociopathic If you re an empathetic person you consider the well being of others in the shared spaces you occupy It doesn t cost anything to be courteous but it can help others a whole damn lot 
Feminism,1615689700,Eh it s more of a personal thing I guess Crossing the street does cost me things sometimes It takes longer to reach my destination and it gives me a bit of anxiety 
Feminism,1615689610,I mean it doesn t cost  nothing  It costs some time and doesn t entirely benefit me when I do it but it seems polite 
Feminism,1615689550,He s a nice person for the most part but he s not really privy to every social cue I like him and this doesn t particularly do much to his character for me  I don t think he cares much about the victim hood olympics as you say I think it s more about not doing anything that would inconvenience himself because he s not inherently a danger  or at least he doesn t see himself that way  
Feminism,1615689348,Violent crime is an assault against bodily autonomy This includes armed robbery assault battery rape murder etc I m not sure this argument holds much water
Feminism,1615689296,Harmony and Equality between the sexes is it for me but you cant do that without dismantling the patriarchy 
Feminism,1615689269,I think the difference is that stalking is an intentional invasion of privacy  or at least an attempt at one which inherently makes the other person unsafe My friend was talking about not changing his behavior in public and inconveniencing himself to make women feel safer 
Feminism,1615689199,You just care because you re not an asshole It s really that simple Yes men are more likely to be murdered but are less likely to be sexually assaulted and in all cases men are more likely to be perpetrators than women and we re less physically capable of dealing with that situation Just tell him it s a matter of being a decent person 
Feminism,1615689124,I think I agree with this sentiment It s just a politeness thing and isn t really doing any harm to anyone else 
Feminism,1615689078,Yes they are This is only a continuous debate with people who hold ignorant views and lack of understanding about transgender folks 
Feminism,1615688991, gt Are you gonna care more for this random dude Be worried about his safety on the of chance a muging happens Are you gonna watch over him to make sure he is not distracted and warn him of any impending attacks or anything like that Or are you most likely gonna continue on your way If I feel safe enough to speak if something falls off of his pockets I ll more likely warn In the reality I ll acknowledge his consideration in my head and appreciate the effort he made to make me feel less endangered   gt Conversely if OPs friend was walking behind you literally not giving a fuck about you and if you notice a man with a knife going to rush him are you saying that you wouldn t even try to warn him and just run away If you do that notice how immediate moraly speaking you loose out on the  deserve to feel safe status If not giving a fuck about me is not getting close to me in a creepy way and minding his business then he s doing fine If anyone was gonna be attacked in front of me regardless I d probably scream to warn it  I think you re stretching what consideration is this context  I said if OP s friend showed lack of empathy and consideration for my fear I d be inconsiderate to him as a friend colleague I won t give a fuck anymore about how he s feeling what he s dealing with etc This is the scenario I made 
Feminism,1615688908,Just as safe but also less anxious and afraid which to me is worth at least something 
Feminism,1615688660,It s literally not that much of an inconvenience for you to walk across the road to make a women feel a little more safer Even if you know you re not going to do something to her she doesn t it s not that difficult to just make her feel a little more safe Even if you don t feel like  accommodating for someone else s needs it s not like a hard thing to do at all just be a good person brother that s all 
Feminism,1615688656,Next step I d say would be for you to be openly pro feminism to your guy friends If the topic never comes up find a way to bring it up Exemplify and normalize men supporting and believing women 
Feminism,1615688576,Yes I recently showed some other online ignorant this exact context of crime data Men who use this  argument are clearly just hiding their lack of empathy and logical thinking 
Feminism,1615688487, gt I m not implying anything I m saying the obvious    How does that work out in real life You are walking down a street with OP behind you And OP wanting you to feel safe does something ie he talks on his phone to his mom stops to tie shoelaces of his velcro sneakers whatever  Are you gonna care more for this random dude Be worried about his safety on the of chance a muging happens Are you gonna watch over him to make sure he is not distracted and warn him of any impending attacks or anything like that Or are you most likely gonna continue on your way    Conversely if OPs friend was walking behind you literally not giving a fuck about you and if you notice a man with a knife going to rush him are you saying that you wouldn t even try to warn him and just run away If you do that notice how immediate moraly speaking you loose out on the  deserve to feel safe status     gt I don t know about you but I believe that kindness generate kindness AAcknowledged kindness generated kindness Kindness done is general without the beneficent part being aware of the benefactor is pointless if the goal is to receive kindness That s not to say you shouldn t do it but receiving kindness should be the goal Good things should be done because it is right to do so and no other reason     gt If this man was inconsiderate to me when I expressed this fear of walking alone at night I d be inconsiderate to him in return    Oh   so this is a social setting So not the situation at hand of walking around at night

Feminism,1615688346,Yeah off the top of my head men are more likely to be victims of non sexual crimes and they also are killed at greater rates in war situations  obviously  Women are more likely to be raped sexually assaulted and harassed And also women are more like to be abused and murdered by their spouse Men that use their argument are technically wrong however they are showing themselves to be uneducated in how to appropriately use statistics in a debate Yeah men get killed at a higher rate because of a variety of situations but they are rarely killed because of their gender sex etc The fact that he used this as an excuse is pretty shitty of him in my opinion 
Feminism,1615688264,If I threw a bunch of harmless spiders at a person deathly scared of spiders would they be actually less safe than if I didn t No but everyone would consider me a huge asshole and for good reason And from a purely logical perspective women have a much better reason to be scared 
Feminism,1615687978,I don t think that acknowledging different people fulfilling different sexual roles inherently denotes one of those roles as lesser than another it s just true that there are differences between sex with different kinds of people independent of any value judgement on those differences and I think it s natural for people to be more inclined towards jealousy when they see someone performing a role more similar to theirs Obviously I d ideally rather there be no roles either I m a non binary genderfluid person who was assigned male at birth and is indeed tired of the ways in which society has punished me for not fitting their perceived standards of what someone with my body type should be  act like and I m not trying to impose any such standards on anyone else I m just saying in general this goes for all areas of life it makes sense for people to be more inclined to experience jealousy and resentment towards those who remind them more of themselves in the same way that people are more likely to compare themselves those who work in their own field than someone who works in a different field  It is true that there are differences when having sex with different kinds of people and to me it is valid for people to experience more insecurity over the idea of their partner sleeping with someone who reminds them more of themself than someone who doesn t because in the case of the person who resembles them more there is a greater fear of that person replacing them  I personally know this fear well my ex also trans but was closeted at the time as was I put relentless pressure on me to be a traditionally hyper masculine man and ultimately cheated on me with someone he decided fit this role better who incidentally also assaulted me During this relationship I was justifiably more threatened by his affections towards men than any other gender although my ex was pan because that was the demographic he placed the heaviest emphasis on comparing me to and that being more afraid of get cheated on by someone you perceive as more like yourself doesn t inherently denote any sense of disdain towards those who are more different from yourself 
Feminism,1615687893,I mean that s her personal experience and there s nothing beyond that 
Feminism,1615687869,Yes I am To clarify breasts are great I m a woman and I m bisexual so I enjoy them in different ways Breasts have a lot of uses and they re pretty cool However their only official function is breastfeeding 
Feminism,1615687819,I don t think that acknowledging different people fulfilling different sexual roles inherently denotes one of those roles as lesser than another it s just true that their are differences between sex with different kinds of people independent of any value judgement on those differences and I think it s natural for people to be more inclined towards jealousy when they see someone performing a role more similar to theirs Obviously I d ideally rather there be no roles either I m a non binary genderfluid person who was assigned male at birth and is indeed tired of the ways in which society has punished me for not fitting their perceived standards of what someone with my body type should be  act like and I m not trying to impose any such standards on anyone else I m just saying in general this goes for all areas of life it makes sense for people to be more inclined to experience jealousy and resentment towards those who remind them more of themselves people are more likely to compare themselves those who work in their own field than someone who works in as a different field It is true that there are differences when having sex with different kinds of people and to me it is valid for people to experience more insecurity over the idea of their partner sleeping with someone who reminds them more of themself than someone who doesn t because in the case of the person who resembles them more there is a greater fear of that person replacing them  I personally know this fear well my ex also trans put relentless pressure on me to be a traditionally hyper masculine man and ultimately cheated on me with someone he decided for this role better who incidentally also assaulted me During this relationship I was justifiably more threatened by his affections towards men although my ex was pan because that was the demographic he placed the heaviest emphasis on comparing me to and that being more afraid of get cheated on by someone you perceive as more like yourself doesn t inherently denote any sense of disdain towards those who are different from yourself 
Feminism,1615687756,Rephrase that to why should men care about women or anybody for that matter And statistically everybody is significantly more in danger from men the difference is men have more power over that dynamic 
Feminism,1615687720,Interesting I don t necessarily see your situation as  politeness  It would occur to me as a character trait Given that the person s actual safety is the same if you re doing it because it s the societally expected thing to do then whatever  Do it or don t do it you don t owe anybody anything  If you re not unsafe you shouldn t HAVE to go out of your way But if you re doing it because you care about a stranger s comfort that s a whole other tomato   Good character or not everybody has their own convictions We just have to figure out ours and not give a shit what other people think of them right 
Feminism,1615687719,I m not implying anything  I m saying the obvious  I don t know about you but I believe that kindness generate kindness If this man was inconsiderate to me when I expressed this fear of walking alone at night I d be inconsiderate to him in return Otherwise I try to be empathic and kind to people 
Feminism,1615687671, gt walking at night is safer as a woman than for a man yet women tend to report more fear  There s a lot to unpack there but there are a few immediate problems with using this as the basis for changing your behavior   The fact that women report more fear may be what s driving them to avoid situations that would make them victims of violent crime If women are more cautious their lower representation in crime statistics makes sense    Women are manifestly harassed more often in public than men in terms of stalking cat calling etc Basically every woman reports having had these experiences usually often So fearing men following them  and potentially escalating into harassment is totally rational Women are almost certainly more likely to be harassed randomly than men are to be victims of random crime    Notoriously female victims of sexual assault are often distrusted and even blamed   male victims of robbery not so much So women may feel they lack a kind of safety net  police support from acquaintances afterwards that men take for granted 
Feminism,1615687615,That s missing the point though I m not only scared of being physically assaulted walking home alone at night I m also fearful of catcalling being followed that some creep may make a note of my address etc Also I ve been robbed once and it sucked obviously but it did not impact my life I ve been raped twice and will probably be in therapy for the rest of my life You can t compare apples and asparagus and say see isn t the asparagus more oppressed than the apple They re completely different and face completely different problems 
Feminism,1615687201, gt He can not care But people will also not care for him    It s not a if  then  else statement People don t care for him regardless of whether or not he cares for others That s the experience he draws from or are you implying that you would care more about him if he tried to make women safer Or that you care fur OP because he makes women feel safer    Is that a metric I can use Should I care more for the safety of a a female acquaintance who takes part in environmental drives food kitchens etc as opposed to someone whose only contribution to society is that she works for big tobacco     gt Women don t ask much they ask appropriate behavior from men If OP s friend isn t doing anything intentionally disturbing he s decent If he thinks he should not care about women that s fine he can But it does make him sound like a utter idiot pretending that men suffer more and similar     I think indifference is adequate behavior in part because it is the norm      gt I walk across a parking lot in the daylight and pray to whatever fuck is in the sky that no men even talks to me The world is not the same for men and women Not in the day not in the night    That we can agree 
Feminism,1615687197,The questions generally not This is r AskFeminists not r DeradicalizeFeministsViaTheBrillianceOfYourLeadingQuestion I ve learned refined my opinions as a result of some of the discussion in the comments but it s pretty obvious when an OP is  asking a question that is really meant to be an anti feminist gotcha and those are not generally the type of  question that gets a lot of interesting engagement 
Feminism,1615687192,That men are victims of more  types of crime means nothing at all For example if  men were murdered  men assaulted  men robed and   women were sexually assaulted women still experience twice as much violence than men If you want to actually do a real comparison you will also have to consider multiple factors For example are men  being less scared than women more often walk alone  in unsafe areas How much of a factor is it that men make up for the huge majority of gang members  criminals in general Are men more likely to try start fights Etc etc I don t know the answers to these questions but they re very important if you want to know who s statistically more likely to be a victim of a violent crime  based on their gender alone  
Feminism,1615687180,I d rather be a victim of violent crime than rape or sexual abuse And in any case I m sure they re not considering domestic violence in this statistic 
Feminism,1615687147,Sure you re not responsible You  can be a kind person and make someone comfortable when it takes no effort on your part though I also cross the street and generally avoid women at night  it costs me literally nothing and if it makes them feel better that s great and I m happy I could make someone s life a little less shit Why is this so hard to understand 
Feminism,1615687122, gt he doesn t feel that his specific role of penis wielder is being replaced she may be sleeping with someone else but she isn t riding someone else s dick That is the whole problem That world view depends on putting all women in their own sperate class which apparently stands below  penis wieder  That not only devalues the sex between women that devalues women Besides it is also just inaccurate with the right tools and toys anyone of any gender can be a penis wielder 
Feminism,1615687056,So if a woman  and a feminist says VERY FEW men are genuine nice guys what s your thought That shes the main denominator 
Feminism,1615686961,Why exclude sexual assault though Is that not sufficiently awful to make us afraid Is getting literally murdered the only thing I should be afraid of I could experience anything from mild harassment to rape to kidnapping to murder The milder things are more likely but I still would prefer to not have them happen on a given outing And if someone is mildly harassing me I have no way of knowing how far they ll escalate That puts me more on edge than I would be if I could be certain that there would be no escalation I can t have that certainty so I have no choice but to take every situation seriously 
Feminism,1615686805,It s common sense that every claim should be investigated But to call every person who doesn t have evidence a liar knowing that there s a higher chance of them telling the truth due to how rare false accusations are is the dumbest shit ever Just because someone is found innocent in the court doesn t mean they re actually innocent Just like you people bitch about innocent people in jail there s an army of rapists walking free just because they know they can always claim it s hearsay if they get lucky 
Feminism,1615686711,You have the right to do that  As OP s friend has the right to not be considerate  He can not care But people will also not care for him  Women don t ask much they ask appropriate behavior from men If OP s friend isn t doing anything intentionally disturbing he s decent If he thinks he should not care about women that s fine he can But it does make him sound like a utter idiot pretending that men suffer more and similar  I walk across a parking lot in the daylight and pray to whatever fuck is in the sky that no men even talks to me The world is not the same for men and women Not in the day not in the night 
Feminism,1615686584,In particular when a heterosexual person believes that members of the opposite gender are awful it s probably because they ve put themselves in a position to be hurt by members of that gender rather than their own E g people of both genders will cheat on their partners but a straight woman can only have the experience of being cheated on by a man so in her experience men will likely have been worse to her than women 
Feminism,1615686306,Yuuup The right love to co opt useful concepts and twist overuse them until they are no longer fit for their original purpose It sucks because it is valuable and necessary to label highlight and discuss the racism of white women but one of the tools that women of color developed in order to draw attention to that discussion has been turned into a misogynist dog whistle for any insufficiently subservient woman For another example I remember when reality based media was becoming concerned about the rise of fact deficient rightwing propaganda the term everyone started using was  fake news  Then you know who got a hold of that term and suddenly nothing is true and everything is permitted 
Feminism,1615686304,I think the key thing here is that  safety is a strange standard for what could be considered acceptable behaviour We could easily imagine an alternative situation where instead of coincidentally heading the same way a man has decided to actively follow after a woman walking home in the dark for whatever reason  maybe he s seen her around and is curious where she lives Let s also say that he has no intentions of doing anything or even approaching her i e he s not actually  dangerous  In such a situation we can easily say that she is in fact still perfectly  safe  But just about anyone would still recognize this behaviour as completely fucked up Because she has no way of knowing his intentions and because the distress it would cause is already harmful all by itself regardless of safety 
Feminism,1615686126,Damn after reading this I think women should have free pads tampons I was gonna say they shouldn t be taxed cuz u need them Decent ones are fucking expensive Being broke and finding a pack of   pads for  dollars saved my life once Unless u wanna see my bloody mess   should be free
Feminism,1615685911,We are socialized to respond how we are treated it s a rare few who treat others better than we have been treated The friend is drawing from his past of no one giving a shit about him and applying it blanket for all humanity It s like the confusion I feel when hearing people say women ought to feel safe at night      and I think no    no one should feel safe at night that s when security is lax and criminal activities begin Going out at that hour is a risk for everyone you should feel scared    I walk very silently and quickly there have been atleast  instances where someone really wigged out as I passed them I don t stop I don t check to see if they are OK I don t reassure I just keep walking rapidly out pacing them Perhaps that s reassuring to them because it implies that my focus is not on them I just behave like the world is a free range with genderless meat shaped obstacles all around me that I must navigate around Surely that s enough
Feminism,1615685807,The part of you pointed sums perfectly the different between being a man and a woman in society  Woman fear for their bodies being assaulted groped and raped way more than they care about being robbed I d rather be robbed      times than be groped and abused Your friend clearly lacks knowledge on the context of this data and what they represent 
Feminism,1615718001,All  top level comments   in any thread must be given by feminists and must reflect a feminist perspective Please refrain from posting further direct answers here  comment 
Feminism,1615717951,Yes there are some thoughts that might sound sexist but it doesn t sound like they come from a general sexist attitude You have intrusive thoughts that try to explain it  these don t come out of nowhere though we re still in a patriarchy  They might vanish with the insecurities Everyone thinks they re  less than sometimes and judge themselves much more harshly than others probably do  As a teenager and young adult I was insecure about my small boobs and thought dudes would think less of me because of them It s pretty deprecating I m older now and that thought never returned in like   years 
Feminism,1615717447,I do think there is a huge beauty bias in the world If I hang out with a handsome partner that reflects well on me it gives me more perceived status and success Society tells me that having this status is very important We are also bombarded with messages that tell us value lies in appearance I definitely think you can be a feminist while being very critical of and struggling with the beauty bias in the world  But I can also see that it can feel unfair and make you cynical I think the biggest flaw I see in your internalized logic is the idea that people are interchangeable Your reasoning sounds like Your personality is worth   points and the other guys is also worth   points But his face is more symmetrical and so women will choose the other guy  or dump you when they can find a guy with a better calculated value  That argument is very reductionist  it leaves out a lot of real life details You could compare it to a large scale research study But to apply it to yourself also reduces you it becomes a kind of self objectification It reduces you from a real life person with hopes interests passions and aspirations to  a carrier of value  That also encourages you to objectify other people in the same way I think the best way to step out of that system is to take steps to improve your own self esteem and self love Not because hot chicks will automatically slide into your DMs after that But because it allows to you step outside of a system of objectification in which happiness is highly conditional and hard to attain and keep Good luck 
Feminism,1615717199,Yes they are body issues But I somehow felt it could be some subconscious misogyny Because the fear that a woman I am dating might leave me for  better men where better means someone taller or someone who is richer etc This kind of belief in incel ish because it supports hypergamy that incels swear by I firmly believe that most women are not like that and wanted to challenge those beliefs That s why I posted here What you said is absolutely useful though Most of my closest friends are women of my age While most of them do like conventionally attractive men they are in loving relationships with men of different shapes and sizes They also encourage me to ask someone I like out which I never did  this is a body issue again because I felt I am too unattractive to date   I also am taking therapy which probed to be very useful It was not initially for body image issues but I am going to talk about them in my next session 
Feminism,1615716950,This  My last serious LTR was with a post op  I normally think it s tacky to mention but it s relevant here trans woman We also had a  no other men agreement  One day she cheated with a trans guy As hard as it was I had to leave her She actually had the nerve to try talking her way out of it  So yeah similar role is a very important detail It s not just about the penis for a lot of us  I hope this adds to the discussion in some way Thanks 
Feminism,1615716814,Just my  cents from reading a bunch of a b o but omegaverse fic doesn t have to be misogynistic  or misandric  Often it can be pretty feminist in tone by subverting the trope i e having the omegas betas and alphas fight against the societal hierarchy Yes there are obvious parallels between gender and the patriarchy but they re not necessarily condoning of gender roles or the  rule of alphas On AO there s actually a tag for subverted abo I like to think of ABO as a philosophical query or a thought empathy experiment I find it interesting 
Feminism,1615716339,Internalised misogyny describes women accepting the devaluation of women as valid So this is a term for women not men What you describe sounds more like a body issue than sexism You re insecure about yourself and your worth and reactions from other people make it worse You re at an age where validation from a peer group is important so this can lead to some damage and anxiety You should try to find a group of people who you trust and who support you If this is really weighing on you you should seek counseling 
Feminism,1615716203, gt You think you re describing a feeling something that resides inside an individual But we re trying to tell you it s not just how women see the world it s a reality that affects half of the population in a specific way at the hands of the other half of the population    I hear you And I am saying it s both    We are living in a time that is virtually the safest in recorded human history And yet if you ask a woman from   years ago vs a woman today they are gonna tell you that they feel unsafe    It s a reality perceived by one half of the population by the bad acting members of the other half Members that the other half fears too by the way           gt Women are telling you that they feel unsafe You say you see women feeling unnecessarily unsafe Why wont you take women at their word and accept that what they feel reflects reality     Because it doesn t Because to accept them at their word requires me to see the other half of the population as predators or as schrodingers rapists I am a person who doesn t even see people as schrodingers theives     gt What you consider idealistic  changing norms and realistic  women gaining agency is only your opinion What many communities have made possible is the former and people who have privilege only ever really consider the latter because the latter doesn t require relinquishing some privilege    Have you ever considered the fact that you asking for help   no demanding that we change the way we do things in our daily lives to make strangers feel safer comes across to the half that you are describing as entitled    Violence defines the world we inhabit It colors everything from our friendships to our enemities to even how we need to deal with assholes in traffic We have learnt to live with a constant low level of anxiety with a constant low level of threat hanging over our heads that s the price of our freedom You can have it too No one made concessions or tried to make us feel safer or welcomed  The world is a hostile place  that s our reality    And on top of that many women expect us to do more to help them feel safer not only simply things like crossing the road or make ourselves less threatening than we are   which is all very doable But then they also expect us to do things like speak up when cat calling or everlasting occurs    Do they not consider that by doing so we subject ourselves to the possibility of an escalation Eveteasers are assholes but they are unlikely to escalate to groping women how ever what do you think happens when a     Manlet calls them out on it Don t you think they are liable to feel emasculated and required to retaliate with physical force to regain it    As a group women feel entitled to feel safe to ask the other half of the population to help them but I am not gonna help them until the stakes are high enough for me to try and help  the lack of my help leading to assault or rape  do you know why  Because men deserve to to feel safe too but we know that we are only as safe as we make ourselves    It was a huge point of contention for a post on r menslib I recommend reading it The users there make this point a while lot better than I am able to    I am a     guy which is midling in my country I am stronger than I look but even so I am not gonna interfere with an eveteading incident because off the top of my head I know of  instances over the last month where a man was assaulted for protesting  one stabed with a knife  he died     If I see a crime in progress a physical one I will intervene or atleast call the cops  but other than that I would do nothing If someone does less than that ie doesn t involve himself for fear of life and limb I won t judge him 
Feminism,1615716017,Oh cool I am new to the terms Thanks for clarifying 
Feminism,1615715766,The starting point of feminism is in fact that a patriarchal power structure exists The very concept of which is that women are in a system that strips them of power and gives men more power over them Quite naturally the in group has more power than the out group to control the social dynamic 
Feminism,1615715684,Yea I suppose But yours isn t outright misogyny It s more subconcious Internalised misogygny is a term generally used for women who project sexist beliefs about women on themselves and on other women
Feminism,1615715213,Maybe I must have used another term I want to challenge these beliefs I am not really sure what to call them Maybe it is just misogyny 
Feminism,1615715080,Doesn t  internalized misogyny refer to a woman who holds sexist views against her own gender
Feminism,1615714915,I am not having a hard time seeing what sparked my insecurity I am having a hard time challenging that insecurity and seeing from a different perspective Just answer this one question would you not date a woman simply because she does not have some conventionally attractive trait but an otherwise amazing woman If you don t then won t that make you shallow Do you think that no man dates a woman who does not meet the criteria that you attest as  perfect  I told this multiple times humans are complicated They have a wide range of preferences or qualities they are attracted to  In a way you actually helped me Because I needed to formulate arguments against you who believes in all the things I want to challenge One person s meat is another person s poison There is no arbitrary standard of attraction Different people find different things attractive I can confirm that from personal experience 
Feminism,1615714119,You seem pretty level headed Having a difficult time seeing what sparked the insecurity 
Feminism,1615713434,A quick look at the study shows that it is very badly designed As I mentioned attraction has many facets Without taking those into consideration I don t think we can get comprehensive results The study only included penis models not humans Don t you think that there would have been different results if there was a guy attached to that penis There could many influences then For example a woman might have a strong attraction to certain physical features and that person might have a smaller penis Do you think that the woman will now choose that guy just because of the penis Don t you think that results may be even varied if you gave descriptions of each guy Say like one guy might have a massive penis in the picture but is described to touch women inappropriately Wouldn t that influence the result The point is men are not walking dildo and have various traits and personalities Women are not hivemind and different environments breed attraction to different traits and qualities Whether these particular researchers believe it or not there are many studies that concluded that there is a strong social factor to attraction And people are beyond their penises and vaginas so attraction can vary 
Feminism,1615713396,You think you re describing a feeling something that resides inside an individual But we re trying to tell you it s not just how women see the world it s a reality that affects half of the population in a specific way at the hands of the other half of the population  Women are telling you that they feel unsafe You say you see women feeling unnecessarily unsafe  Why wont you take women at their word and accept that what they feel reflects reality  What you consider idealistic  changing norms and realistic  women gaining agency is only your opinion What many communities have made possible is the former and people who have privilege only ever really consider the latter because the latter doesn t require relinquishing some privilege I hope you think about that difference a little bit 
Feminism,1615713047,He said he wasn t asking me Then he proceeded to ask me lol You see question marks in his comment right 
Feminism,1615712628,I clearly directed the question towards feminists  I don t know if you are a man woman or non binary but let me tell you that this post is very much directed to questioning challenging those notions Besides have you critically seen the study How many participants were there Did they take into account social conditioning What were the ages of the women in the study What are the mean response and the standard deviation What are the dependent and independent variables Are there any other studies against this  It is easy to claim studies concluded something But there are many factors that might prove those theses theories wrong Especially when it comes to social psychology and issues like attraction which have significant influence such as social conditioning environment previous experiences etc Many racists want to prove certain races are unattractive by  science  But they are not objective truths Attraction can have many facets Despite never being in a relationship I did like several women who weren t conventionally attractive completely because they were amazing people Similar studies like you said would say that I shouldn t be attracted to them but I was  All I want to say is if you cannot critically think and argue about the claims you are supporting especially in cases of science then begin doing that instead of trolling on the internet You are neither helping anyone or yourself Humans are of huge variety we cannot say this is arbitrary of what attraction  should be 
Feminism,1615712083,I use female avatars all the time and this is the reason I used to give this wasn t ever true but I d say it cause I didn t wanna seem  gay       so it s possible a lot of people give that reason just because they think that s what they re supposed to say 
Feminism,1615712016,Yeah I m obsessed because I m small My insecurity doesn t change what studies say Thanks for the pep talk 
Feminism,1615711933,That s just bullshit Besides based on your history you are a bit too obsessed about this topic to think clearly So I m not even going to argue right now
Feminism,1615711650,That s perfectly fine But there s tons of pubmed studies saying it So I m not just making it up 
Feminism,1615711575,i find it helps if you focus on the actions of the bigot rather than the effect they have on the person they re effecting when you call them out      Like don t defend that specific woman just call out their sexism when it happens I find that usually goes better 
Feminism,1615711527,Wow This comment is not going to stay here for sure   
Feminism,1615711180,I m not a feminist but in the multiple studies on size they do rate the guy as being less masculine

Feminism,1615707132,But fear is a personal thing a lot of the feeling of non safety that I see in women is because of a deep ingrained fear that has been pushed into them by the messaging that they are weak and fragile Men have similar fears but we are taught to accept the risk as a part of living we are taught that we are responsible for any and all things that happen to us Hyperagency I won t speak to the negatives of it they are obvious However there are positives to that approach in life I can and will offer help to someone who needs it Someone who needs it tangibly However I don t belive that we can ever make someone feel truly safe that s for themselves to accept or not While the obvious answer is to find ways to make the world safer realistically the only way to reclaim the night to to change the way we deal with risk not to avoid it but to manage it and to belive that we can And of course to not blame the ones who are not able to  
Feminism,1615706752,People say it because that s what modern feminism is a fascist and power hunger cult just like the nazis were 
Feminism,1615706279,I m sorry if i offended you but can you explain a bit why im objectifying women in this post I don t want to provoke i just want to learn 
Feminism,1615706277,Are you a man If you are you probably have your own lived experiences which you can use to contradict your views I m sure you ve heard some upsetting things from men which you can use in defense of feminism I know that s not a whole solution but it can get you thinking  Good luck  
Feminism,1615706021,Exactly the patriarchy isn t explicitly deciding to oppress individual women while they re walking down the road but that s the effect of indifference It takes actively changing your behavior as a man to help reduce the patriarchy s restriction of women s experiences 
Feminism,1615705231,I think what you ve been doing up until now is right It is important to speak up to bigotry and misogyny when you notice it and I applaud you for doing it The backlash you re experiencing is the same kind feminists get when they refuse to coddle men As patriarchy is a social system there are also women part of enforcing it Hence the negative reactions from women to your actions  It s generally in the interest of patriarchy for men to not step up to bigotry to just let it slide for them to only be interested in protecting a woman in case of sexual desires While contradicting that you will obviously stroke the fur the wrong way for more people than just the one you re calling out on bad behaviour Keep doing what you re doing and know that the comments of   gt   she wont fuck you     She s not your girl  are  natural reactions to that  at least in patriarchy and don t let yourself get dragged down because of these It s the price every activist has to pay Ignore these comments the people saying this aren t as woke
Feminism,1615704544,I m glad you brought this up because it does highlight why this discussion can be so difficult It s so critical to not tear one oppressed group down while trying to prop up another It s further complicated because  Karen has definitely been coopted and used in misogynistic ways but that s not how it started There are a lot of shades of racism blatant racism aversive racism ignorant racism etc and this manifests in a lot of different ways in different situations When Black folx describe a recurring way in which white women can and do abuse their privilege often in ways that play off of their own oppression in the structure of patriarchal white supremacy  see  Central Park Karen as others have mentioned it s important to listen to that Naming things is a powerful way to highlight structural dynamics but of course a single word or name like  Karen is going to be reductive and can easily lose its nuance or unfortunately be coopted In my experience it s So Hard To tell people they re racist and expect them or others to listen Having terms to describe how they are doing that helps I m not sure I support the ongoing use of  Karen given the points you ve made but there s a lot to be learned from its origin There is no real male equivalent for  Karen because in these discussions white man already tells us plenty about a person s privilege And I would point out that in pop culture you  do find references to Steve Chad Dan Kevin etc I do think that the reason they haven t caught on the same way as  Karen is because of misogyny 
Feminism,1615704317,If caring only applies to women  and excludes men does that count as benevolent sexism So it s good and bad at the same time 
Feminism,1615703962,I suggest checking out r StreetEpistemology and try framing your conversations from that standpoint Mutual respect an inquisitive approach to understanding and carefully guiding her through deconstructing her internalized misogyny from a place of how they relate to her core values 
Feminism,1615703546,Hi I ve talked about it on here before but I used to be your friend a few years back  I was a borderline alt righter who was obsessed with anti feminism anti social justice and was a bigot who would join in  raids towards feminist groups What got me to change was people using subtle  disguised feminist leftist  and social justice language and talking points For example if your friend brought up male suicide don t use the word toxic masculinity or any feminist words She will only think you re calling all men toxic and won t listen Instead  Say something like  men are pressured into being a traditional version of men which can cause them to bottle up emotionally and not seek help   She ll probably agree with you if she agree with MRAs If you keep using disguised language and talking points she might change or better yet might even research for herself and change 
Feminism,1615702936,I didn t say he was a typical loser dude I said he LOOKED like a typical loser dude He is fairly successful whether or not I know why I ve only seen him in things where he is mild to moderately overweight and not middle aged but did look like he looked a bit older than he was from bloating But you did seem to miss the issue tv is pairing up merely average looking or worse dudes with super attractive women And not vice versa So considering him to be average looking is just making the point If you refuse to put up average looking women and instead only model attractive ones on tv in movies etc  then the same should be done for men Or just make them all average looking 
Feminism,1615702804,I find the whole idea of being a   white knight kinda dumb like just let people be  kind to each other I don t have a lot of advice but I think being nice is always great
Feminism,1615702615,I totally agree with you Idk Maybe I m just spitballing here Not exactly sure what my original point was anymore  And ty 
Feminism,1615701867,I m fine I m as cool as a cucumber here I m not a feminist but I m the only person who called it out that comments like these are like water to an MRA dying of thirst Sure it s just one person but they had many upvotes before it was But not one single person here spoke up and said  hey that s not really cool 
Feminism,1615701262,How about dropping the tags  anti feminist feminist and take one argument at a time then analyze it and see if the r thorique has flaws and if you agree with it In the end the content should be what matters Men right movement have good points worth investigating on and feminist arguments are valid very often but not always 
Feminism,1615701187,Breasts are a secondary sex characteristic which means they develop differently for males and females  in general and like you said they are often erogenous zones and are sensitive  But just because something is a sex characteristic or an erogenous zone doesn t make it inappropriate or in need of covering Adam s apples and body hair are secondary sex characteristics and most parts of the body are erogenous zones for someone There s no logical reason for why women s breasts need to be covered that isn t related to societal perspectives
Feminism,1615700105,Read literally anything by Andrea Dworkin specifically though  intercourse by her is really good and so is  pornography how men possess women 
Feminism,1615699826,For me the goal is the liberation of women which requires dismantling the patriarchy Equality isn t my goal 
Feminism,1615699800,that seems way too simplistic and seems like a way to dismiss any and all counter arguments men as a group or even as an individual may offer The patriarchy isn t a ku klux klan like group gathering in board rooms rubbing palms together saying   how do we fuck women over today  It s a corporation with sentience but without morality whoes only concern is how to continue to exist in this world How to keep accumulating power As we live in this world both you and I struggle to do the same thing to gain enough influence to get to chose how we live To go from obscurity to fame to go from undesiredable to attractive To be validated as much for who we are as what we do and so we play into it The patriarchy is upheld by both men and women actively and passively and in much the same proportions Maybe check your biasis today 
Feminism,1615699176,It s worth acknowledging that there is a difference between interpersonal and institutional systemic racism While white can experience prejudice on the basis of race they can not be oppressed on the basis of race Whiteness is normative and white people exist in society as the dominant social class meaning there is no institutional prejudice or systems of inequality relating to race that impacts or makes the lives of white people more difficult Reverse racism is generally something you hear in response to white people being asked to examine their privilege or take responsibility for reinforcing social structures rooted in white supremacy Your question is a complex one Racism and homophobia are both oppression that is formed around structures of normativity and ethnocentrism The two manifest in society in different ways and I am not sure it is particularly productive to compare the two 
Feminism,1615698605,Your friend s reason might be better expressed as she does not feel safe topless around men who might give her unwanted attention For what it is worth I breastfeed and when school age children of my friends are around they are curious and want to see my baby drink milk They smile and ask their moms if they were breastfed and it becomes a discussion on mammals 
Feminism,1615698462,It s only considered socially inappropriate because it s considered sexual   The imposition of sexuality onto something nonsexual is a cultural phenomenon And culture can change but not if we don t actively work to change it Since the normalisation of breasts will benefit most women then isn t that something to strive for Just because something is socially unacceptable now doesnt mean it should remain that way forever 
Feminism,1615698144,I do find it ridiculous I just don t see what the fact that a body part is considered  sexual or not has anything to do with whether or not it s considered socially appropriate There s no inherent reason why twerking is sexualized but it is still considered inappropriate Same goes for being topless It just seems like a misguided appeal to authority in the form of biology 
Feminism,1615698042,The status quo or everything as it currently is IS misogynistic in that our institutions are built by men for men  Welcome to r askfeminists 
Feminism,1615697894, gt First no body part is inherently sexual even sexual organs They are sexual in a sexual setting but outside of that they are just another body part This      Also lowkey reminds me of a story about a woman showing her boyfriend how she puts in a tampon And after she inserted it he asked  why didn t you moan  lmao Like just because something involves a part of the reproductive system doesnt mean it will elicit a secual response 
Feminism,1615697448,Because if breasts aren t inherently sexual then why should we have to cover them up Imagine if women decided that men s hands are sexual That they can t be shown in public because that s obscene So men have to buy    gloves to cover them up gloves that are uncomfortable and dig in and leave marks on their skin Male celebrities get harrassed by tabloids and have abuse levvied at them when the gloves accidentily slip and show a bit of hand And then men say  fuck it i don t want to wear gloves anymore Hands aren t even inherently sexual  And women reply  that doesnt matter because  we find them sexual so you have to do what we say and cover up  If you find the above senario ridiculous then you can probably understand why the oversexualisation of breasts is ridiculous 
Feminism,1615697211,Exactly or to be informed that what they re doing is a problem and insist that it isn t 
Feminism,1615697181,Depends I guess I adore shit schlock movies from the   s   s grew up on mst k and they are usually filled with stuff that wouldn t fly today But that s me laughing at the movie rather than along it More contemporary stuff like friends and the rest I just find that extremely unfunny A really good example is everybody loves Raymond and agreed watching a few episodes I was like okay he s a shit husband and now what Are we gonna build on that The funny was nowhere to be found
Feminism,1615696657,OP said breasts are to some degree sexual body parts and I was explaining why I think that s not the case at least outside of patriarchal social norms 
Feminism,1615696472,The word is sexist Why is there a gender specific insult for racism when racism isn t gender specific and women aren t more racist than men Why is there no male equivalent insult  The idea the word is about calling around racism is a pretense in the first place   it s literally just used as a synonym for the word bitch at this point and men on the internet are loving the fuck out of it to use it to harass women in situations that have no relation whatsoever to race If you want to call out a racist just call a racist a racist You don t need to  bring in and weaponize the preexisting cultural attitude of contempt towards women 
Feminism,1615696365,The thick of it is excellent Peter capaldi is great as Malcolm tucker The side characters are pretty fun too
Feminism,1615696146,Not sure what the fact that  breasts are not inherently sexual has anything to do with it though There are a lot of countries where a woman s shoulders are shoulders arms chest legs etc are sexualized and considered inappropriate 
Feminism,1615695733,I dont know I was an activist for years and pulled quite a few women out of the hole but i was also very experienced in debating these talking points by that point For every anti feminist talking about there is at least   probably more excellent counters and since most anti feminist youtubers are terrible people it is usually easy to find proof that they don t know what they are talking about Without knowing her exact positions and reasoning it s hard to tell you what you could say And you should not feel weird telling wrong people they are wrong Like i said i pulled quite a few women out of the anti feminist rabbit hole and from my experience as long as you are not condescending or rude it should be okay You do need to know what you are talking about though and she has to be open to discussing it Her huffing at your evidence is not a good sign though 
Feminism,1615695699,Then he s not believing women about their own experiences and actually going as far as to pathologize it 
Feminism,1615695629,From a feminist perspective everything is misogynistic given enough thought    That would be a fun drinking game game though 
Feminism,1615695617,It s not just polite it s acting in accordance with feminist values to work towards a world where women and men can  feel equally safe 
Feminism,1615695598,i think people should stop  searching for things to be offended by 
Feminism,1615695436,I would tell all the people with opinions on it to write them down like really get into it  pages back and front on their opinion why they think what they do and any far reaches of thought this takes them to I would then instruct these people to fold this information up as small as it will go  so its got nice pointy hard edges and then proceed to place this with all the other worthless shit they produce by inserting it up their asses WHO CARES IF SOME DUDES FINDING GIRLS FUCKING OTHER GIRLS HOT yeah maybe shes a bit of a dick for cheating on him but obviously he could deal with it and still be happy with her so who cares 
Feminism,1615695412,From a feminist perspective indifference is misogynistic Enjoy being part of the norm but it s not feminist 
Feminism,1615695326,No problem And I do appreciate you being considerate and also asking about the specific reasons Most men don t really see what women go through on a daily basis in public so it can be hard to conceptualize  For reference I was first followed by a man when I was   with my aunt He followed us for several blocks and eventually we hid in a cafe to escape him When I worked my first job as a teenager I was cat called between  and   times  no exaggeration on each lunch break when I only walked    blocks I bring male chaperones to bars with me but if the guy I m with goes to the bathroom a man will immediately come to me to hit on me This was compounded with sexual assaults I had experienced  anything physical was from people I knew and I eventually shaved my head and would leave the house only wearing baggy sweats to avoid street harassment My story isn t unique Most women mentally consider their entire night as far as transportation goes before they wear a cute outfit It s a constant thought process for most women So it s really nice when men who don t know you are also considerate on your behalf
Feminism,1615695318,You behave like the world is genderless because you have the freedom to do so Women cannot afford to do so because of all the men who target them for benign women So that s your right know that what you re choosing serves to maintain the status quo where men walk around with more freedom than women 
Feminism,1615694799,Technically sociopathy is not considered an acceptable term in psychology and is strictly a criminal justice criminology  label Traits commonly associated with  sociopathy or  psychopathy can fall into the category of antisocial personality disorder but the terms are considered quite offensive within psychological mental health circles 
Feminism,1615694519, gt It won t convince him because he believes it not his fault women have this fear How incredibly flawed is this logic by the way  I m not responsible for             happening so I m just not going to give a shit about it and potentially harm people with my ignorance and behavior with no remorse    amp  x   B I haven t heard a single good argument to support his side of this at all 
Feminism,1615694472,And thus instead of asking ourselves  why  we ask  why not   In the words of the great William and Theodore  Be excellent to each other 
Feminism,1615694372,Thank you for helping me see it in a different light 
Feminism,1615694324,Your friend sounds   lovely  I m lying  He sounds like a jerk 
Feminism,1615694279,The issue is we still  feel like we re being followed Most women have trauma of a sexually violent or harassment nature Many women have been followed or harassed by strangers I don t know many women who have never been cat called or followed by a stranger Many women have PTSD  being a woman is actually listed in the DSM as a risk factor for PTSD  You wouldnt walk through a room full of veterans banging pots and pans because you might trigger a trauma response from someone Being conscious of making women feel safe is similar You don t know if the woman you re trailing has PTSD from being stalked by a stranger or some other trauma that makes her hypervigilent of men
Feminism,1615694185,This is a great point I agree that white women who use their privilege as a weapon should be called out for it I remember the story of the woman who was in the park and she called the police on a black man who was bird watching At the time  Karen seemed to refer to that kind of racist behavior specifically from white women Now it s a term that seems to have misogynistic undertones that are hard for me to explain but I know it when you see it 
Feminism,1615694141,I think it s awesome of you to take the time to explain him btw As you said he doesn t care because he doesn t feel the issue has anything to do with him So bring back the point of view on someone he technically should be more concerned about like his girlfriend sister mom 
Feminism,1615693957,Seriously And the edits about his friend s girlfriend Cringe  Oh poor me I can t decide who I agree with  
Feminism,1615693824,You are incredibly biased Your friend is sexist and lacks empathy and you stand by him in that and even question if you are not convinced by his views yourself   You even have your own sexist biases to contend with judging on the things you ve said here It s more than talking about politeness when you looking at his comment about men experiencing more violence to divert from the fact that women overwhelmingly experience more sexual violence Let alone the fact that it s men that primarily perpetuate all forms of violence It s like that one liner  Men are afraid that women will laugh at them Women are afraid that men will kill them  If you can t recognize the difference in experiences between men and women and at least have some modicum of empathy about it you re dealing with misogyny then 
Feminism,1615693802,This stuck out to me too It s one thing to not go out of your way to do it It s another to try to convince your guy friends that they shouldn t
Feminism,1615693748,Dude someone who says things like your friend is not a cool guy Maybe to YOU but his attitude towards others puts him in huge a    hole territory    I m so glad my partner and his mates are the types to stand up against the discrimination and oppression of others they treat women LGBTQ and POC s with common decency Restores my faith in humanity that decent men do exist 
Feminism,1615693540, gt I think this is an interesting case If we stop telling women to fear men in order to be safe would the fear go away No because all women know a woman if not many women who has  have been raped You asked somewhere else if men had power to change this dynamic Yeah if they stopped assaulting women Men are the primary perpetrators of violence against all genders Ya ll have the power to stop that by not committing crimes Until that happens   until a girl is born into a world where she doesn t hear about her relatives or friends getting assaulted or isn t assaulted and harassed herself women won t stop fearing men 
Feminism,1615693477,I mean that s a whole other thing Racism and sexism unfortunately do coexist Till and the victims of the tulsa race massacre were victims of racism justified by white men through sexism You say it as if it was the white women doing the lynching when it was due to white men being mad at black men  in tills case Bryant s husband in the massacre hundreds of white men for not knowing their place and infringing on their property 
Feminism,1615693348,This is so true I was thinking this but I couldn t put it to words 
Feminism,1615740039,i m going to challenge your idea that people leaving their significant other because they ve found someone more attractive is shallow  I ll agree it s shallow in the case that the person leaving actually really liked loved their SO However we shouldn t pretend that people have fallen out of love and left for someone who  happened to be more attractive in some kind of sense That happens all the time I think OPs fears are valid but he should know that it shouldn t stop him from trying to find love because surely someone out there will like him regardless of his flaws like you said However I d also advise OP to keep himself on his toes maybe try and exercise better himself in someways to prevent the potential of his looks playing a factor in someone falling out of love with him Because that definitely does happen and we shouldn t pretend we live in a Utopia where it doesn t 
Feminism,1615739856,Also STIs are less likely to transmit from vagina to penis than the other way around I think men taking responsibility for wearing a condom is pretty important My female friends say that most of the men they ve hooked up with needed to be told to put on a condom More condoms in media would be good Sex scenes almost never have any mention of a condom I have a vague memory of rap videos in the   s showing rappers hooking up with women and a string of condoms being shown in a cool way More education about condoms would be good too We all got that demo showing how to put one on But no one tells you about all the little fumbly details that a young man will encounter during that process Also sex positivity is important Women should get to feel good about the fun stuff they do too More videos like this   
Feminism,1615739840,So you literally want to find out the bare minimum necessary to not be a bad guy I m sorry but that doesn t make you any better 
Feminism,1615739690,It s not disingenuous at all I genuinely want to wash my hands of this I don t want to be targeted by all the posts littering my social media feeds about how terrible men are 
Feminism,1615739564,It s not even  disguised  just clear We tend to use a lot of specific vocabulary and forget that most people just aren t familiar with it 
Feminism,1615739451,Oh yeah i know that Its just how i wrote it I dont let bad shit pass just cos its someone i know or thought was good
Feminism,1615739325,Others have written good answers but I wanted to add that you should try to change your perspective from  confronting bad  people  to  confronting bad  actions   Separating people into good and bad can make us overlook the bad actions of people we consider good 
Feminism,1615739322,Consent culture and sex positivity  flawed concept as it is can take a bite out some of these problems but the entirety isn t going away until the entire culture that feeds them is tackled I m afraid 
Feminism,1615738979,I want to address number   You say you re afraid that women will  realize there are better men who are more handsome have bigger penises whatever and leave you I ve seen similar ideas in some red pill circles and I do think this is misogynistic It s subtle but it makes it seem like women are shallow and don t know what they want Think of yourself in that situation  if you got into a relationship with a woman who had some physical flaws would you eventually  realize that there are more beautiful women out there and leave her This implies that you didn t really think about your decision to enter into that relationship  If a woman chose to be in a relationship with you I don t think she would just wake up and realize you re not attractive and leave you Most women are pretty decent decision makers at least as good as men so if a woman decided to date you it would be because she saw your flaws accepted them and still wanted to date you She wouldn t later  realize you are flawed and leave you We are all flawed  That being said I do think your bigger issue is your self esteem I think working on that will really help you and is a step toward creating a healthy relationship with someone you love You sound like an awesome guy an awesome feminist and any woman would be lucky to have you 
Feminism,1615737865,Right but it would exempt me from being targeted by any of the social movements protests and riots etc And I don t need to feel intrinsically guilty for being male If that s what it takes then count me in   
Feminism,1615737575,While I agree that sometimes people can be easily upset I also think there is no harm into working out why they are upset and examining your own actions and thought processes for fault  I think just as often as people get needlessly upset people blame other s emotions on them being too easily offended without examining whether or not what they did is actually objectively offensive  As my Biblical Theology professor always said it is better to have strong loosely held beliefs and be willing to examine them for fault at any given time It is only a sign of growth to refine or change your opinions or actions

Feminism,1615736560,Question If a person fails to read the rules of the subreddit they ve just found today and then is politely asked to follow those rules but responds to that request by calling the mod a Weinstein sympathizer and a rape apologist how is that not an attack How is that at all a reasonable response No 
Feminism,1615736496,Yes as mentioned in my post I understand why  notallmen is a stupid hashtag Thanks insight nonetheless 
Feminism,1615736348,It s a fucking disgrace what else could I think It s simply horrific Women shouldn t have to fear to be kidnapped and killed just because And we all know the police doesn t actually protect the people they never do but the fact that a police officer did it is kind of adding insult to injury  On the other hand   for me a Latin American woman this is not exactly new Like in my country it seems that every week we hear on the news about a woman who has disappeared only for her corpse to appear days or weeks later or sometimes never And don t even get me started on Mexico where this happens every day Same with police brutality towards women in my country there are reports of women that were detained on the March  demonstrations and were sexually abused by policemen  Anyway As we say here in LatAm ni una menos nos queremos vivas

Feminism,1615736170,I don t know what  I m good means here Like  as long as I don t rape anyone and I don t let my friends rape anyone if I happen to come upon them when they re trying to I don t have to put any more thought or effort into any of this

Feminism,1615734361,Okay so if I don t rape anyone and none of my friends do then I m good right 
Feminism,1615734262,I don t think these things are related For some women  probably the majority a man s height and penis size do matter for some they don t Just like for some men  probably the majority a woman s age and weight do matter  you ask yourself if they do for you but for some they don t So if you want a partner you will need to find a match End of story 
Feminism,1615734136,I d prefer mixed gender spaces with strict and well enforced anti harassment policies and teachers bosses promoting equality As a non binary person I prefer being in a group of people with various gender identities over being the odd one out in an otherwise homogenous group
Feminism,1615734091,I ve read this elsewhere and I think it s a helpful way to think about the  notallmen hashtag  notallmen is the  alllivesmatter of the MeToo movement It s a knee jerk reaction to redirect an important conversation that diminishes the people trying to speak out just because their experience makes you feel uncomfortable Nobody said that all lives don t matter nobody said that all men are abusers It so profoundly misses the point 
Feminism,1615733838,Sometimes For me it depends on whether there s a substantial problem particularly an ingrained disadvantage to be overcome 
Feminism,1615733818,I agree this is not helpful but generalize and lumping a group of people into a box isnt helpful  I have yet to meet a man who hasn t discussed been taking advantage of monetarily by a woman but I by far don t think this is all or most women  Not even half  I don t think a hashtag is the answer but I also don t think overgeneralizing is the answer   I have been raped twice Both by women  Alcohol and violence and public humiliation were a factor in one I have been physically beaten a few times because I refused to hit a woman back based on my values  However I hasn t affected my views of women when dating or any of my social habits or the way I do things   I don t like those people but have never looked down on a whole gender poorly because of it 
Feminism,1615733231,Deal with your own demographic   that s how men can help If you see shit behavior call it out especially people you know Silence is acceptance That s it No one is asking you to do anything other than call out shit behavior when you see it and then learn how to explain to your demographic why their behavior is problematic  amp  x   B Every guy using  NotAllMen at least lets us know they re part of the problem as that hashtag immediately dismisses the lived realities of most women The men who aren t  NotAllMen are calling out shit behavior and standing up they SHOW they aren t the problem by demonstrably being part of the solution Words are cheap when action is what s required 
Feminism,1615733156,I dated a guy who could not wrap his head around the fact that women don t get off on inserting tampons 
Feminism,1615733128,I love that monologue That dude is doing some great work 
Feminism,1615732936,I mean   what do you think we think about it A woman was kidnapped and killed just minding her own business  BY A POLICE OFFICER and then the police went on to manhandle a bunch of women at her vigil Like honestly what are you expecting us to say here 
Feminism,1615732874,Oh god I m so sorry I can t imagine The whole country just feels like a brutal senseless mess right now

Feminism,1615732630,Daniel Sloss does an excellent bit about this in his  talk to your boys monologue  you can check out the relevant part here   The frustrating bit of this is that every man says  well I would never mistreat a woman like this and neither would anyone I know  but then who s out there hurting all these women Sloss point is that he ignored problematic creepy behavior of his friend towards women for years dismissing it as banter just a joke harmless doesn t mean anything by it etc  and then his friend went on to rape a woman  To say nothing of the fact that women are sharing their stories of being assaulted by men in the wake of the Sarah Everard murder and men are being like  yeah but what about MY feelings   People also think of rapists and such as masked men jumping out from alleys to attack lone women when in reality women are way more likely to be raped by someone they know Which means it s someone you know too Highly recommend watching that bit It does cut off slightly early but I m sure you could find the full bit somewhere 
Feminism,1615732459,So if I cheated on my wife with other men and my wife found about me cheating and the thought of me having gay sex turned her on and she would like me to carry on having sex with men   My wife would considered a controling monster in this relationship and she would be to blame for my cheating 
Feminism,1615732344,It is sad that a person cannot walk alone safely at night merely because of their gender and furthermore the police s conduct at her vigil wherein they physically assaulted the protesters is disgraceful 
Feminism,1615732334,I ve been to a girl s only school and see some benefits there  at least for the age of       That s where the gender divide in subjects  girls do well in languages boys do well in maths starts and ends approximately It s also where girls and boys get really judgy with each other on body issues Since they can t avoid people at school this might protect them somewhat I think that s the age where the biggest damage is done in education and mental health After that I can say that women who went on my school were more likely to choose their paths pretty easily Yes there are struggles and discrimination but most aren t very intimidated to begin with 
Feminism,1615732220,Yup you re already having a pretty outlook and you re not alone in these feelings I think you have a lot of thinking to do and I m not sure another long comment is going to add anything Re the Indian part I think the media and the behaviour of men in india reflect badly on the diaspora in the US it affects self esteem quite a bit I d look for positive role models that reject and defy these things Lily Singh riz Ahmed Hassan Minhaj are all ppl that come to my mind  Good luck friend   
Feminism,1615731992,I don t care for men who use that hashtag Because it s certainly not all of them but enough of them so every woman has experience with sexual harassment assault or worse And then focusing on the fact that they re one of the good ones and don t  deserve to be generalised makes me sceptical of how  good they are at best  In terms of what you can do how to approach it I found this dude on Instagram the other day and like his approach Maybe you would benefit from watching his video He basically explains how looking after your mates and making sure they don t hurt others is a way of showing friendship and caring for your mates  It s really good

Feminism,1615731376,What happened at the vigil last night was a fucking travesty 
Feminism,1615731248,What should I think about it It is terrifying and a tragedy She did everything she should have been doing by societies standards and still got singled out by a member of police and killed  It s disgusting And scary And puts every woman s safety into perspective Hell they told women to stay inside while they investigated  as if we weren t already thinking three times about every walk taken alone in the dark It s ridiculous  And honestly the aftermath shows exactly why things like this continue to happen  with men telling women how bad  they have it and how we should get over it before they even identified her remains I don t want to hear it The last few days were triggering to the extreme with no place that isn t either infested with men looking to play the whole situation down or filled with women who are terrified and mourning  I hope the man who killed her won t be let go for some arbitrary reason But if he is   I won t even be surprised And I hope there ll be lasting change now but I doubt it Especially as large parts of the population are busier challenging the validity of people s grief and outrage rather than stepping up and doing something to fight the problem

Feminism,1615730750,It s tragic and I hope the person who did it goes to jail for very long time 
Feminism,1615730550,Here are some articles you might like Readings on relationship anarchy might also be helpful here I ll try to find more examples shortly  For Lovers and Fighters   by Dean Spade There s a Spanish version available but I can t find it  gt It was a relief to me to find out in my teens that there were feminists mounting a critique of romance I saw how the myth of heteromonogamous romance lined up to fuck women over to create a cultural incentive to enter the property arrangements of marriage to place women in a subordinated position in the romantic dyad to define women s worth solely in terms of success at finding and keeping a romance to brainwash women into spending all their time measuring themselves against this norm and working to change their bodies behaviors and activities to meet the requirements of being attractive to men and suitable for romance I see this myth as both personally damaging to people in that it creates unrealistic expectations about ourselves and each other and causes us to constantly experience insecurity and also politically damaging because it s a giant distraction from our resistance and it divides us  especially based on the fucked up self fulfilling stereotypes about how women compete with each other  Sadly although the usual tropes are focused on heterosexual romance much of this gets carried into queer communities as well and surrounds our approaches to sex love and romance to varying degrees It s important to have a critique of the myth of romance that looks at how damaging it is to us in our personal lives and how it is designed to fuel social arrangements codified in law that were invented to subordinate women and make them the property of men  On the salvational quality of queer friendship   by Jonno Revanche  gt While some of our straight peers grow into their late   s and begin to invest all of their energy in their spouse many LGBTIQ people grow older together in less linear ways  Romantic Love is Killing Us   by Caleb Luna  gt I don t want to be loved I want to be cared for and prioritized and I want to build a world where romantic love is not a prerequisite for these investments especially not under a current regime with such a limited potential for which bodies are lovable Which bodies can be loved cared for and invested in 
Feminism,1615730386,a The vast majority of people are still deeply invested in patriarchal norms   b When you say  people lie  I want to maybe help you see that this is not a universal view by far and many exist that don t care about stereotypical notions of what is desirable while others do This makes people different from each other not liars unless the exact same people say one thing but act differently    c I want to maybe talk from my own experience  I lived as a man for a long time before I transitioned I haven t been single for a long time and since I started to date  at around the age of     I haven t been single for more than  months    I have had no trouble attracting people of all genders  admittedly  I have only ever dated one straight person and while I have had to date loads of people to find people that were into me  I was super skinny  not very strong quite nerdy autistic and couldn t really bother with penetrative sex  I was still able to find people and keep those relationships for a long time  I m currently dating three partners  two guys and a woman  all of who are bi and I found before I transitioned  there has never been the threat that any of them would  abandon me for a more normatively desirable person  
Feminism,1615728901, Hey thank you for your amazing response Definitely the complete idea could be described as toxic masculinity It perpetuates some pretty questionable traits like  chasing girls Because one thing we need to realize is that girls women are   not  goals to achieve or things to chase after They are people You   form  relationships with people We never chase after friends We make them because we have similar interests values or cultures Another thing that it perpetuates is the idea that you need to be muscular and big to be attractive or love yourself which is disturbing to me because I personally never find big muscle or super low body fat attractive What is the point of doing something if I don t find myself attractive Weight has never been an issue to me because I lost    lbs twice but gained it back due to depression and loneliness But I see what you are trying to say I love to lift weights and workout because it is healthy not because I want to have big muscles or something My insecurities stem from things I cannot change like my height or my penis size Another thing that toxic masculinity perpetuates is sex as a performance To be honest sex is viewed as something done to a woman rather than mutual pleasure If you watch any mainstream pornographic video it is centered around PIV sex and the idea that bigger is better If you view it as a fun activity out of love passion or attraction then things like penis size insecurity won t stem out  One analogy for this could be bowling with friends You go bowling with friends not because you want to win but because you want to have fun The friends who take it personally and are always trying to win will probably annoy others We should start looking at sex the same way It is not about winning  orgasm  but having fun Sometimes you win sometimes you don t but what should matter is if everyone having sex had fun If you start taking a lack of orgasm personally which toxic masculinity does you will start having problems  I also wanted to share how Indian men are viewed in the west which messed up my self esteem Again this stems from toxic masculinity and a little bit of racism Indians are either seen as misogynistic jocks or nerds who don t have social skills Either way they are seen as most unattractive But should it matter Attraction is completely personal What some find attractive may not be attractive to others so I don t think I should feel bad The racism part is concerning though I never ever visited PUA websites and stuff I always hated them One thing that I always believed was I should not put up an act to attract women Because if that is the case she liked what I told her I am not what I am Which is the cornerstone of a toxic relationship Also they are usually filled with misogyny and viewing women as prey which is weird considering I want a loving relationship not a prey predator relationship My height has been big insecurity because shorter men are considered weak This again is perpetuated by toxic masculinity As far as I know I am pretty strong Also I am in no way interested in fighting or physical violence So it should not be a big factor Some women may feel height is an important factor but that doesn t mean anything to me other than being incompatible with them But toxic masculinity is a real devil violently affecting women but silently affecting men I am trying my maximum not only to challenge these thoughts but ask my friends to do the same 
Feminism,1615725865,Exactly And women are just as human as anyone else Don t believe the incels 
Feminism,1615725374,I think the term you re looking for is secondary sex characteristics 
Feminism,1615725199,I completely agree with HampsterInAnOboe and I have to thank you for asking this question Only just this morning because of your question I stopped trying for  breast play to do anything for me I ve struggled with some unrecognized shame that it has never appealed to me beyond pleasing my partner and while I knew that breasts were not inherently sexual I realized that on a deeper level I felt bad that I did not find it arousing You ve helped me notice this shame and eliminate it 
Feminism,1615725075,Thank you That actually gives me a great perspective shift Because at the end of the day humans have multiple dimensions and will have hundreds of reasons to make decisions that we may not predict  There was a statement in The Flash in a recent episode You cannot predict emotions 
Feminism,1615724834,I realize I didn t really reply to your OC but it was triggered by the idea of humans as replaceable and the laptop comparison We are not laptops We are like plants Each unique and with personality 
Feminism,1615724498,Hi I moved to North America from india at a similar age as you  i was    and had this experience While I m not overweight so I cannot even begin to understand your experience I was really short and average looking Since I was young I had tons of body image issues mostly because of what I saw other  perceived men do They were jacked were always in relationships great at sports amazing dancers It felt like the world was just unfair to me tbh  When I moved to America this just escalated     x The partying culture all the white boys were so much taller than me all the clothes didn t fit me and once again the  always be in relationship mode That and how the media shows that I should  hyper sexualized  pick up artists axe body spray   which made me feel even worse that I was getting rejected when I asked people out   This made me actively try to  become white so I could fit in more  I m now   and I ve been through a lot but I have to say that I m finally beginning to love myself for who I am I feel FREE  I ve been in and ended one amazing relationship which happened not because I had a massive dick or  abs it happened because we loved the same board games and enjoyed each other s company  I ve no longer try to assimilate and become white I m happy with my skin color and I ve accepted that looking average is not a bad thing There are different strengths to offer  I wanted to take some time to reply to your particular points   People lie about lots of things But they ll always find a reason to justify why you may not be good enough I can t lie and say that aesthetics are not important But in my life I ve found charisma and confidence to be more important due to my average looks So just stop giving AF about what they re saying and just cultivate some healthy passions and friends and see who it may lead you to Work on your self confidence unrelated to women s appreciation of it Also no one cares about dick size it s not visible externally  I know surprise  men obsess about it so much and if when you are having sex they pass on you for that They probably need a reckoning with their idea of masculinity too    This is the idea behind hook up culture There will ALWAYS be someone better than you Just accept it I assume you re not into hooks ups so the time and energy that you put into a relationship determines the healthy status of it rather than your aesthetics    I don t think you are misogynistic  you seem to be the opposite an ally  but you may be suffering from toxic masculinity because you re expecting things from the opposite sex A few years ago I joined r Menslib and read books from bell hooks Liz plank to help me understand how masculinity is really a brainwashing engine built by patriarchy Since then I don t see any need to conform    Read some feminist literature on masculinity There are some really good stuff there Why feminist literature Well men and the patriarchy have written MOST of what we see Clearly that hasn t worked for us Maybe it s time to read up on the true tenants of feminism and realize it s not a hive mind If people like you and me do not subscribe to the masculine hive mind it s not reasonable to assume feminists do   Follow some minority influencers you like on tik tok Follow indigenous people fat people super skinny people non conforming men You ll see the world has so much variety and interesting things to do besides dick size and women I ve found these to be amazing eye openers about my own views on the world and gives me confidence that I am unique and beautiful too 
Feminism,1615724081,It sounds like you already know that it is inappropriate as a man to explain enforce feminist values but you re seeking  permission or validation to proceed anyway When a woman participates in the oppression of other women they are experiencing internalized misogyny as a product of being raised in our misogynistic society it s bad but it is still a product of misogyny Instead of targeting women struggling with oppression women would benefit from observing you police other men As a white woman it would be inappropriate for me to police a black person on internalized racism I can know that racism is wrong but never fully understand the daily impact of a racist society and its affect on my personality and values   which means I have no greater authority or perspective to offer someone in their situation and I should continue to police racists that share life experiences and privileges and that I could offer sincere perspective to 
Feminism,1615724040,Yes pretty much When I feel like I m not in control or I don t feel good about myself I really like to dig down into the theory until I feel I understand it I think you are like that too That makes it really tempting to dive deep into laptop buying tendencies so you will understand it all But in the process it s really easy to forget that we re not actually laptops And thinking of yourself as a laptop is not healthy I hope you can change that view 
Feminism,1615723555,I think a lot of what you re looking for would be filed under  amatonormativity  a term that originated in feminist theory and is now also used widely in queer theory  Google that and you ll find lots of hits  Some good non paywalled stuff I like    Ways Amatonormativity Sets Harmful Relationship Norms For Us All  Everyday Feminism     Down with Partners     Amatanormativity and Relationship Anarchy  
Feminism,1615723486,I understand your concern about feeling that women are of a  hive mind  That s valid It can help to challenge your perception of women in general Women are so often considered as women first What I mean is that really women are human beings Why not try to see them as just people first People are not all the same and  you seem to understand that you can t predict what people are going to do or say in many situations Also FWIW my boyfriend is the same height as me 
Feminism,1615722955,I reported them to a mod That s also speaking up
Feminism,1615722797,I agree with others saying subconscious misogyny is a better way to phrase it than internalized  just as an fyi  Honestly a lot of body issues and dating expectations preconceived notions that we have may come from patriarchy no doubt and this can influence any person of any gender in various ways And there are studies showing society has a bias towards attractiveness But there is no reason to objectify yourself and think of women as points and yourself as points as another commenter said  height is   points personality is   points penis size is   points etc  breaking yourself and others down into parts where we rank things into such categories Life is hard enough and much more complicated than that anyway And women are more complicated than that as well most of us don t go  is his smile wide enough are his muscles big enough adding up points its much more holistic and for a lot of us it s also how a person makes us feel that plays a huge component So assuming women do think in terms of  points like this is where the subconscious misogyny may come into play  darn you patriarchy   Also good luck with therapy    You seem like a thoughtful person who will work hard and figure this out 
Feminism,1615721837,I personally do not believe the strength of a female character has anything to do with whether she exhibits more masculine traits or feminine traits The strength of a female character is about whether she is depicted as having agency over her own self or whether she merely exists to help and support the male character s own journey and self discovery  For example let s take Ripley from Aliens as an example Apparently the role of Ripley was written to be unisex where a male or female cast member would be allowed to play the character Ripley didn t exactly look like a typical female character in an action film of that time She wasn t wearing any makeup She wore practical clothing as opposite to skin tight cat suits with stilettos and she was treated like one of the guys on the ship  She is never used as a prop for other male characters journey She exhibits strong leadership and survival instincts Despite her masculine traits she has autonomy over herself and drives the story forward That s why she is a strong character Her gender is not used to portray her as weak Her strength comes from her resilience a trait that both men and women can possess 
Feminism,1615721628,I think what people label as masculine or feminine should be changed like being a leader It should be none I don t think there should be any masculine traits or feminine traits It just created an unnecessary divide of both sexes 
Feminism,1615720911,Definitely patriarchal ideals have a role to play here and attraction in general One simple fact is that modeling agencies do not accept guys who are less that  ft  at least that d what my model friend told  Let s not forget that modeling agencies are heavily male dominated So this generally comes from the idea that tall men are stronger and more authoritative But is that really a case We are not gorillas to decide leaders based on physical fight  Usually the features you described like shoulders length or chest fat in men are picked on more by men in my personal experience For example I firmly belive that it is just patriarchal conditioning that people automatically assume a guy is tall when someone says he is attractive  But yes there are many other factors which effect attraction What is that person s personality like One of my friends found a guy attractive at first But after knowing that he is a raging misogynist she never found him attractive again Even I had someone whom I wasn t initially attracted to but found her increasingly attractive as I got to know her more What may be attractive to one person may not necessarily be attractive to another because it is completely personal 
Feminism,1615720528,  Plus most of those guys have been raped assaulted  usually physical violence rather than rape by other guys I d advise OP to stay away from gangs himself when walking alone He seems sensible enough to do that 
Feminism,1615719814,I get what you are saying and I think too quickly people can jump to say any physically strong determined cool under pressure stoic woman is  masculine  why not say she is  Midwestern American   It s just as arbitrary  Why is a physically strong woman not feminine  All those adjectives describe an Olympic gymnast or a professional ballerina for example  how is Simone Biles or Misty Copeland not feminine   I also do get the argument that we rarely see feminine coded traits being the ones to say the day  At best we see feminine coded traits being supportive and helpful and masculine coded traits as heroic  That too reinforces gender roles However I do agree that there is this pattern where we cast any woman expressing masculine traits as  not feminine and also not quite ever capable of doing so called masculinity  right  in a way we don t do with men who show sensitivity nurturing caring etc 
Feminism,1615719706,Well a strong woman in action movies swearing like a sailor making sexist jokes likes to shoot things up Oh yeah to recognise her as a woman she s wearing make up nice hairstyles and sooner or later has to play the seductive vamp  That s not a female character and nothing of it screams  strong  Erin Brokovich was a strong female character  though the real Erin Brokovich seems to be a badass too  
Feminism,1615719644,While your specific issues aren t necessarily  internalized misogyny  patriarchal values and standards do have a role in this  The problem stems from the patriarchal view of what is masculine and what is feminine Traits that are usually associated with women are often considered unmanly not manly enough esp in the Indian context anything fem is considered automatically funny and below the standards for me Physical features like upper body fat thigh fats smaller heights longer hair    Basically anything that is typically supposed to be a feminine trait when seen in a man is considered unattractive ugly  It s tough to break through the mould of patriarchal thinking we have grown up with but it s possible Ask yourself this question why exactly does a stereotypical standard set by patriarchal notions should be the only definition of masculinity or even attractiveness Any standard set by society isn t the only standard Physical traits are just minute details when it really comes to long term relationships While people may choose someone superficially attractive to go on dates with having a wholesome relationship depends on what happens after and who they are as people 
Feminism,1615719578,eminism is intended to benefit everyone as a whole I think to explain this its good to use neutral language stay far away from any demonisation of both men and women in the name of feminism  Sometimes when women are very anti feminist it may be because they have a lot of male influence and loved ones in their lives Hearing radical and misandristic feminist takes can really push people away and I really hate that reality Some women are also happy with their role in society and subservience in a subconscious or conscious way and thus don t see the need for feminism as they feel equal and appreciated MRA standpoints may help because of this if she cannot sympathise with the struggles of some women its likely she can with male struggles By explaining and tying them into feminism you may be able to get the gears turning as to why its a good thing  honestly you could maybe go further and begin to explain why her views also hurt you as a person MRA and feminism are linked by the societal functions and expectations that oppress them I think its a very slow process because it does because conspiracy theory territory with some people in the alt right pipeline I would heavily use your friendship and knowledge of her situation and the people around her to sway her outlooks I mean look at all the evidence testimonies and outrage there is in the UK at the moment with the Sarah Everard case Overall its something she has a privillage and a luxury to plead ignorant and dismiss genuine issues 
Feminism,1615718796,I just want to try and tell what I understood so you can correct me if I am wrong You are telling that there might be many other factors which will influence dating decisions And that viewing them objectively and making generalizations can just result in objectification of both myself and people around me because I am seeing personality traits of people like features of a product Like two laptops with same features but completely different build can result in different demands  If that is what you said I kind of see how illogical it would be to apply to humans Because everyone has different traits sometimes unique to that particular person But even if we take the laptop example people can make different choices despite the one with a great design being a better choice objectively Price could be an influence functionality could be an influence or a person might like the laptop with an okay design because of a personal preference While this might sound like objectifying I am just trying to put my understanding that many factors might influence a person s choice and decision and it is difficult to consider them all Is that what you tried to say

Feminism,1615398695,I never realized that before thank you a lot it s really opened my eyes a lot more Of all the major social media platforms I see most conversations happening on twitter so I thought it was mainly there Like for instance I ve talked a lot about ADHD  cause I have it and when I finally saw it trending a few weeks ago it felt like it was finally being talked about It also took me a long time to finally find a pocket online where ADHD was actually being talked about too  I ll take your advice because I ve spent the past few days away from twitter and I ve felt a lot happier and now I m more inclined to find the conversations I m looking for somewhere else Like just looking through one of the subreddits recommended to me on this thread I noticed a huge difference in the language being used

Feminism,1615397763,So I m telling you what I am because I know SM uses that format  it s a problematic and ineffective format but you re using it precisely because that s what other people do You think that s how a conversation about an important issue  supposed to go To put it gently twitter is a great platform for short punchy communication It s meant to be a little abrasive abrupt  that s the nature of the platform But as fun as it is twitter is not where  everything happens and it s not true that just because something isn t a trending hashtag it isn t important and no one cares about it My best advice to you would be to spend less time online so you can recalibrate your conversational style and capacity I know for me that the communication  styles associated with many SM platforms have resulted in me not even using twitter and curtailing my participation on other platforms  because I don t think they promote effective or meaningful conversation 
Feminism,1615396630,I didn t notice that I use a lot of language like that it s what I ve picked up from social media I ve never realized it wasn t okay I ve seen a lot of conversations brought up using that kind of language I was just trying to find where the conversation I m looking for my intention wasn t to shame anyone I ve tried a couple times on social media to talk about it but I ve never found any engagement for it so I honestly just didn t know where to look for it Tbh now everything I ve learned from people s responses to this thread has made me realize how bad social media is  or at least twitter with looking for the conversation I m looking for I also know I m horrible at communicating what I m trying to say so sorry for that

Feminism,1615395035,Yeah I think patriarchy runs so deep and is so entrenched in everything that we really do need to dismantle and rebuild from the ground up  every norm and assumption our current society is built upon tends to be at least somewhat tainted by patriarchy Doesn t seem reforms operating within the current societal system can cut it 
Feminism,1615394981,I personally find this kind of absolutism very frustrating You make these general statements like  No one is talking about this  the conversations are  never present  but at the same time admit you haven t been active in trying to find spaces or people where these things are discussed online I think it s way less productive to try to shame people into talking about an issue you want to talk about by accusing them of not caring or purposefully ignoring something  and yes though it may not be your intention  this kind of  no one language is absolutely antagonistic and shaming than it is to be pro active about something you care about If  not enough people on social media are engaged in this topic and you really care about it  then you need to signal boost those topics and show some leadership for increasing the visibility of the things you care about in a way you think is appropriate sitting around waiting for someone else to do it for you is truly baffling to me 
Feminism,1615394624,Thanks You know it s hard to imagine a time when this won t be an issue So long as men are in power This government system was not designed for women or people of color We need to just dismantle the whole thing and start over If only we could   
Feminism,1615394484,Oh god yeah don t ever hit on someone at work They can t leave and in most cases they re required to be nice to you regardless of how inappropriate your behavior is 
Feminism,1615394446,I struggled a lot with internalized misogyny I also lived on fantasy and adventure books and I think those played a role in how I wanted to present myself to the world I was also bullied quite a bit so I think I started trying to find an identity in  not fitting in  because the more I tried to  fit in the worse it got for me because I was very very bad at understanding and reacting to social cues That combined with the internalized misogyny translated into  I have to act like the boy characters in the books I read for me for a good part of my childhood Oh also I m gay So there s that lol I have some gender stuff I ve   barely  scratched the surface of too though it s all so hard to untangle  I ve only just come to terms with being a lesbian in the last few years I grew up in a religious family and kid me being gay would have been wholly unacceptable even if I hadn t been ostracized at school I think I can understand what you re saying about the romantic narrative between girls and boys I really really didn t want to kiss or marry a boy  though at the time I thought I was making that feeling up and would eventually want that and being a tomboy might have been another act of rejection for me 
Feminism,1615394380,I keep thinking we re getting lead up to  feminist icon Lena Dunham or something 
Feminism,1615394257,I ll seek out those platforms more then I didn t know where to start honestly but I have a better idea now And yeah I recognize that with social media A lot of what I ve learned about feminism in my classes never seemed to be present in the conversations I see on social media 
Feminism,1615394084,  Do you understand what cancelling means Or are you just mad about it because you feel it s  unfair or  goes too far    If his sister has unresolved feelings about what happened or never knew it happened and found out as an adult  then regardless of when the incident occurred or why he is definitely accountable to apologizing to  her  at the very least He did a wrong he should seek to correct that wrong if he is able This can look a variety of ways and may or may not be a  public event   If someone apologizes to one person they behaved inappropriately towards but then continues to behave that way in future interactions  that suggests that they weren t accountable for the behaviour The work they did towards remediating the harm they caused wasn t genuine  they apologized as a means to escape accountability They are still liable therefore for the harm that they caused A trend like this might be called a  pattern of behaviour and suggests that a private or public confrontation regarding the offender is not adequate to correct or deter the person from continuing to harm others  a more serious consequence or intervention may be required 
Feminism,1615393674,I think that s a matter of curation on your part  you see more of what you seek out  If you aren t seeking out people and organizations that give platforms to these ideas  that s not necessarily the  fault of the people and orgs etc you are seeking out to follow It doesn t mean the issue isn t considered important or relevant For all the talk of algorithmic alignment and echo chambers  social media will not actually present on a platter the information you desire It s an active relationship 
Feminism,1615393003,What do you mean when you say  cancelled  what comes under that heading for you 
Feminism,1615392712,Same It s women all around the world who will lead the march against the right   
Feminism,1615392459,It s been a while since I ve seen it in whole I know those exist but I feel like they haven t gotten much recognition with what I see on social media 
Feminism,1615392453,I m not from USA but I am voting against the same lunatics in my country   
Feminism,1615392422,I actually looked for that thread to link it but it seems it was by the OP 
Feminism,1615392090,Cancelling someone in this manner is holding them accountable for their actions There are consequences for what people do Even now if it is just coming to fruition 
Feminism,1615392076,Only one way to mitigate it  I use that word because my pessimistic ass genuinely thinks we can t avoid it is to Vote Those Bastards Out  If you re a woman vote And vote against the right wing 
Feminism,1615391953,I feel like you already posted this question a month or so ago 
Feminism,1615391396,Can we please stop using  cancelled when we mean  held accountable for their actions  These are ridiculous situations How was a    year old person  accidentally sexually assaulting someone Furthermore are you suggesting that we should  cancel somebody for a mistake they made when they were a child Children need education and potentially counseling not  cancelling  If someone is aware that the thing they are doing is wrong and continues to do it they should face the necessary consequences for those actions 
Feminism,1615390654,Did you watch the entire documentary It explicitly named a number of programs and advocates trying to change the situation for boys 
Feminism,1615388910, gt This is already the law in the US it is not in France and Germany unfortunately  
Feminism,1615388703,I think that for anyone of any gender leaving a career to raise a family is a hugely dangerous career move that can leave you trapped in a marriage where your partner has all the power and literally no one should do it without a very clear and frank discussion of  what would happen if the working partner was no longer living or able to work or we got a divorce  that results in the homemaking partner feeling that they d be adequately safe and independent in the case of the worst happening But that being said I think stay at home dads are equally awesome brave people as stay at home moms 
Feminism,1615388462,I dunno why do some girls like Barbies Kids like different stuff  I feel like I ve always liked the stuff that I like and people came up with names for what that made me The thing that I don t get is what the arbitrary cutoff line is for who is a tomboy  All the girls in my neighborhood climbed trees and rode bikes and played sports  Some of them also played with dolls  Some of them also played with dinosaurs  Some wore pants and some wore dresses  There s some magical line where you like enough girl stuff that you re  normal and too little and you re a  tomboy and it really just feels like arbitrary boxes trying to divide up and pathologize a normal variation in human interests 
Feminism,1615387953,Yes but that is an exception as you mentioned so it is better to go with the general rule 
Feminism,1615387852, gt Further a mother should not be able to unilaterally add a father to the birth certificate In most places it is not the case that someone can just randomly pick anyone to put on the birth certificate  the father has to have been present and usually also sign the certificate themselves This was also already discussed elsewhere in the context of this thread  which again I m presuming you did not actually read The problem with this whole thread trajectory is that you are outraged at me about something that largely doesn t happen the way that you ve decided it has I find it very depressing how often I have to tell people that if an issue is of such significance to them  it behooves them to have a more complete understanding of the nuances and specifics of the subject 
Feminism,1615387665,one of those FDS tinged  I m a  real feminist because I take advantage of men things it seems
Feminism,1615387446,Other commenters had good points but I d also like to add that standards for women are stricter Like those benefits aren t just contingent on being a  feminine woman but also a young and attractive one Also the role we have to perform in order to reap any  benefit is a subservient one where men are expected to perform the role of a superior Being constrained into  any role is harmful sure and that s why conversations are held about toxic masculinity etc But it s so different to be constrained into the role of superior vs inferior leader vs follower paid labor for the family vs unpaid labor for the family 
Feminism,1615387069,This Anna Bey person seems to be some sort of lifestyle influencer on social media I don t think she has anything to do with feminism 
Feminism,1615387064,This is probably one of those threads where OP drops some inflammatory shit and then never comes back 
Feminism,1615387039,Some people really want to get fucking murdered We re not about to make murder socially acceptable regardless and any person who wanted to get murdered going around defending murderers like  well some people like ME  like getting murdered would rightfully be punched in the fucking face Like how would the catcaller know that the woman they re calling is into it or not Any person advocating for predatory behavior because they re personally into it is disgusting and selfish I m into being slapped but I don t go around like  well some women  enjoy it when people are talking about dv like are you fucking kidding me 
Feminism,1615383707,If you see this as a valid question why are you still alive What a kafkaesque debate we have here 
Feminism,1615382874,I joined the Satanic Temple when I saw the writing on the wall a couple years ago If the Supreme Court deems bodily autonomy unconstitutional they will have to fight through my religious freedom next 
Feminism,1615382679,Yes I was thinking this I do know people that have met in such contexts but it s always been triggered by some of factor for a example I know a very eccentric couple that met in a local  shop after stopping to comment on each other s outfits They hit it off immediately so the proposal to go for a drink wasn t unexpected I think a lot of people struggle with context and reading situations
Feminism,1615382168,We should question everything that s how I learn at least So I m still trying to understand the objectivity in what you re saying Your justification seems to be that number of options in one s life is the qualifier for goodness in one s life that having more options is inherently better than having less From my point of view that still seems like a  subjective opinion 
Feminism,1615382098,I m looking at DC and wondering why the fuck we have to keep playing this game Forget Roe v Wade  stop relying on a fickle judgement that can be obsoleted in one stroke of a pen if  people share the same opinion For Christ s sakes it s been almost   years   Congress needs to codify abortion rights in law 
Feminism,1615381057,I never said that all men would have sex with all women I am simply giving examples where I have heard men express sexual desire for what they claim are unattractive or average women to illustrate the difference that I believe the previous commenter was referring to The jogger situation is from personal observation I have been shocked to see literally every car driven by a male slowing down and or the driver looking out their side and rear mirror Every single one I have been the jogger and a person walking behind the driver I have had men admit to me that feel compelled to look at female joggers My point is I have never seen women do this but it is apparently quite a common behavior from men 
Feminism,1615379272,yeah I assume the argument would be that if you don t want to have any babies you shouldn t be having sex Despite the fact that that s never ever worked in the history of ever 
Feminism,1615378168, gt That would be a hard sell considering many people don t even know they re pregnant by then The argument will be that women should just be  more responsible and take the initiative to check their pregnancy status consistently and rigorously To a man or an older conservative woman who has lost sympathy for those with unwanted pregnancies or just someone who s generally out of touch that argument will likely make total sense 
Feminism,1615377976,You are not entitled to free speech on Reddit my dude Also  r feminism is very clear about the fact that they are a space for feminists to talk about feminism not for people to come and antagonize and ask questions that are critical That s the point And that s fine because sometimes you just want to talk about your thing without people bugging you about it 
Feminism,1615377686,Ah so now all of a sudden you don t want to carry a critical conversation just because it s inconvenient I thought we were supposed to be up to talking about things from both sides to understand one another 
Feminism,1615377436,I think you misunderstood what I said Being a man gives you a bonus over being a woman  at least in most societies  this applies to all of them But then there are many other parameters and  bonuses like being white being rich being intelligent etc Each human being starts with  bonuses and  maluses  I don t know how to express this differently  And because all humans are made of many different qualities and characteristics it does happen than men will be less privileged than some women But the fact is that in our societies we put values and hierarchies between the differences between humans and in that sense being a man is considered more valued it gives you an advantage and this applies to anyone being in that category But of course you re not only  a man  you are many other things that will influence your place in society And yes there are advantages a black man has over a woman You could become president of the USA for example Or in some countries you d have much more rights than women Or you have less chances to be sexually assaulted etc This of course doesn t mean all black men have it better than all white women It s like saying men are generally taller than women It doesn t mean ALL men are taller than ALL women it doesn t mean that you cannot find MANY women who are taller than MANY men etc   but the general statement still is true men are generally taller than women 
Feminism,1615376807,I already had a consultation for it a few years ago so I m on the books fortunately 
Feminism,1615376711, gt Do we really have to have a conversation about how the feminists of of    s era are not the same as the feminists today Do we Apparently we do I didn t even read the rest because this is ridiculous 
Feminism,1615375294,lol demmian is a MALE who thinks his phil   class lets him talk down to women 
Feminism,1615375054,I agree with you as well I wanna ask you something though do you use TikTok Because that platform is one of if not the most toxic social media right now The petty gender war between men and women is ridiculous and it s so sad to see so many  feminists saying all men are rapists and whenever someone tries to say otherwise they respond with  it s a large enough portion of men to classify as all of them even though it s like       And it s also sad to see the men on TikTok shutting down actual feminists just because they re women 
Feminism,1615374638,Please don t be sorry You are so on point about everything 
Feminism,1615373104,My role of thumb is if they can t physically remove themselves from the conversation don t hit on them So ie people in line barista s and service employees etc 
Feminism,1615372948,I think it s simply misogyny to call girls who like  boyish things a  tomboy  Everyone is perfectly allowed to like whatever they find interesting We should stop gendering activities and hobbies for good Climbing trees and liking cars doesn t make you less of a girl than liking dolls and pink skirts 
Feminism,1615372885, If that s what they want to do that s cool Men embracing their nurturing side is a good thing for society  They  and their working partner is she is female face a lot of sexist backlash in society  Being completely financially dependent on another person is putting yourself in a power dynamic that can be abused  that goes for stay at home men or women
Feminism,1615372655,Not only that but following feminist on instagram made me realise my internalised misogyny even though I called myself a feminist It is shocking how many of the things we believe are normal are rooted in patriarchy So in that sense we improve ourselves our mindset Following feminists that recommended important books say things I have never thiught about before and would have never fought for if I didn t know  But it is alw ys funnt to me when someone especially a male tries to show we are not feminists enough
Feminism,1615370563,Since my country finally made abortion legal in     it s so sad to see the US go backwards at this stage It s like one step forward two steps back for women
Feminism,1615370085,I m not even American and even I know this is a false equivalence because the republican party of today and the republican party back then were not the same and basically have completely different platforms 
Feminism,1615368977,Hey how else would your kid have   years of working experience by the time he she left the college 
Feminism,1615368967,It s a reactionary movement all movements have to start at some point 
Feminism,1615368574,I m mostly worried about my friends who are still stuck in the States and my sister who might be forcibly moved there by our parents later this year 
Feminism,1615368126,My partner and I would ideally love a situation where he is a stay at home dad and I work We d like to homeschool while the children are little  until about age     and he d love to be the one who was primarily doing that Once the children were in school he d likely go back to work but for several years he wants to be at home with the kids and I d be fine with that We both have our own savings accounts so if he needed to be financially independent he could etc  Will we ever be able to afford to live on one income Probably not but if we could we d definitely strongly consider him staying home with any children for their early years 
Feminism,1615365606,The elderly and babies get raped what they wear has no bearing on whether they will get raped or not a rapist will rape regardless of how a victim dresses 
Feminism,1615365297,Around here women get cat called even when their hair is messy and they re wearing a full tracksuit Revealing clothing isn t needed for men to act like beasts 
Feminism,1615365124,This is a really good point I don t think career Republicans want Roe v Wade overturned as they d lose a whole block of single issue voters Would be really surprised to see more than just a theatrical performance at the Supreme Court 
Feminism,1615363874,I am sorry that sucks a lot As a man it pisses me off when women aren t taken seriously or are treated differently for something a man would be praised looked up to for I can only imagine how tough that must be Sry  
Feminism,1615361125,Yeah that s what my impression has been I hope it didn t sound like I was implying there was evidence in the opposite direction 
Feminism,1615361022,On a philosophical level I would say yes biologism is always using  nature as the explanation so womanhood becomes a thing that is shaped by nature and not by society If you assume that there is no binary gender  which is scientifically correct you can t exclude trans women except your argument is sex nature  This is the same concept modern far right groups are using  ethnopluralism to justify their racism and sexism  for example the caring nature of the woman   the white woman needs to be protected from the sex driven barbaric immigrant etc or some climate change movements that tend to slip into social darwinism etc this has the potential for fascism but the main issue is that it supports fascists argumentation 
Feminism,1615360311,She is not a self proclained feminist  This question is disingenuous because she actually identifies as a  traditional feminist  whatever hell that means and is a critic of  modern feminism saying feminism no longer serves the interest of women  She s basically a Christina Hoff Sommers who calls herself a  factual feminist but is really anti feminist because she spends her life railing against feminism So calling Anna Bey a feminist while probably being very well aware she s anti feminist is disingenuous 
Feminism,1615359970,I haven t watched freaks and geeks but that sounds exactly like what I m trying to avoid so thank you for saving me from that disappointing watch  
Feminism,1615358148,He s a POS I have an IUD at the moment but I am seriously starting to think about and researching sterilization of some kind I m very concerned about those methods being restricted  even more than they are now with some doctors just unwilling to do it unless you re married and already have kids sometime in the future as well Women live on a knife s edge in this country 
Feminism,1615357931,I humbly disagree If you consider living with the trauma to be worse than death then according to this logic then a rape survivor is better off committing suicide since you consider the death to be less bad thing than a traumatized life 
Feminism,1615357633,We can t It ll violate the separation of powers clause and be ruled unconstitutional FDR s own senate commission in the     s came to the same conclusion as will likely Biden s in a few months The court was only expanded a few times hundreds of years ago because as the union took in more states they needed more judges to keep up with the workload of travelling to each state by literal horse to hear cases And since these days the court stays in one place and just picks and casually chooses as many and whatever cases it wants to to hear while the Appeals Courts hear the rest the workload precedent is long dead  The GOP have closed every avenue to stop them 
Feminism,1615357507,Please refrain from using terms like  male or  female as nouns  Man and  woman are very much to be preferred  
Feminism,1615357180,I m very worried that it ll be overturned The way the GOP has been playing politics with the supreme court it s just a matter of time It s time to increase the number of justices to the court

Feminism,1615432680,I feel like most women these days are over sexualizing themselfes and then complain about being objectified 
Feminism,1615432665,I don t know if it s feminism exactly but you re right  I think the cultural divide between men and women in the US is different to the UK American men as the traditional target TV market in control of the remote are offered material they can relate to and aspire to like the  ordinary guy who is actually a cool guy in disguise and the  funny cool guy as well as the more aspirational  obviously hot cool guy  US women have traditionally been a market for TV advertising who are just expected to buy what they see and so they were offered aspirational tokenism fit for the male gaze primarily Men didn t want to see regular women on TV and women wouldn t buy their Nordstrom dresses  I think it s worth noting that the BBC revenue doesn t come completely from advertising I m pretty sure all most of TV station revenue in the US comes from advertising  and free to air television over there is fairly competitive 
Feminism,1615432330,cool and props for you to calling that  but what does having a need to dominate sexually has to be equal to rape the key word missing in a sexual act and rape is consent and that s the bedrock if two people consent what type of activity and with what dynamic they engage in it doesn t matter  i mean we might agree on this that beating a random person out of the blue just to test your street fighting skills is the definition of arsehole behavior but when you wrestle with your siblings for fun it s not arsehole behavior both are acts of physical agression but labelling both as  toxic masculinity and  boys will be boys is like comparing a tea leaf with a cup of English tea 
Feminism,1615431757,Entirely     in agreement This is an issue that really bothers me about American  and thus Canadian TV Men can be anything from stunning to meh but women are ALWAYS stunning In Canada we do a tiny bit better job with our  serious business programs   but yea It all sucks and I don t know what to tell you other than it s DEFINITELY not your imagination 
Feminism,1615431559,Same I m American and I have noticed this phenomenon for   years Good call y all 
Feminism,1615431447,wait you won t protect your loved ones and would instead argue and debate with someone who just slapped your mother sister out of the blue what s toxic in protecting your loved ones and teaching others not to screw over your loved ones  if you don t teach them a lesson they ll go on and be more and more open to attack others because they were never stopped 
Feminism,1615430383,it s not public opinion in the democratic sense where the majority of people have the opinion and so action is taken What happens is small minorities of people on twitter are being very loud which is then making employers cancel their employees

Feminism,1615427729,I first believed her more but I read that she had lied in a court because of that her lawyer dropped her So not as much anymore Joe Biden was creepy though but he seems to be behaving a lot better lately Cuomo is the bigger fish nowadays 
Feminism,1615427427,I am not from the USA and I do not now the details of all the allegations I think the democratic party went with the option of a not ideal white establishment guy because that is seen as and quite possibly sadly is the  safer option for getting more votes than anyone of colour any woman or anyone not from the mainstream political clique

Feminism,1615420786, Masculinity doesn t only have negative traits It has lots of positive ones Toxic masculinity is meant to only refer to the negative ones Negative male gender roles might be a better word choice 
Feminism,1615420084,That is what then is the meaning of feminism Do you behave correctly and everything will be fine Nobody argues with this Don t tell others how to behave and admit that a girl can be masculine and a boy can be feminine Nobody argues with this Do people like to generalize Yes But this is a property of thinking We cannot get rid of it completely When you are a neural network forced to make decisions in situations where there is not enough information to make decisions this is simply inevitable At the level of thinking 
Feminism,1615418057, gt It is not true to say that  masculinity only has negative traits Toxic masculinity does not mean or imply that masculinity   only  has toxic traits The fact that you have to differentiate it from masculinity in general is the clue 
Feminism,1615417846,We can t vote the Supreme Court out And with Amy Coney Barrett we may now be fucked 
Feminism,1615417642,Aren t these same characteristics leading to male dominance in power and gender wage gaps It is not true to say that  masculinity only has negative traits 
Feminism,1615416647,Because white people and men already have the majority of the power It s really quite simple  Girl power Black power etc imply  yes let s have a share which we are currently not able to access   White power and  Male power imply  let s keep the majority of power which we already have  
Feminism,1615415663,Buy  why are men more likely to employ the methods they do compared to women  Why are their resulting rates of suicide higher Perhaps due to the lack of support and counseling they receive men are more likely to attempt suicide while in a deeper depressive state and thus are  sure of their decision In contrast perhaps women are more likely to still feel conflicted about their decision to commit suicide and therefore employ less instantaneous methods Men are also more likely to self medicate via substance abuse which may have an effect on how and when they commit suicide That choice to self medicate could again be attributed to a feeling that they must deal with the problem themselves rather than seek help You cannot simply say that there cannot be any relationship between suicide and social stigma surrounding mental health support simply because they don t attempt suicide more often than women In fact there is  plenty of data to show that they seek help less often and that this is correlated with holding more traditional views of masculinity  
Feminism,1615415586,Being male or being white already implies having more power because we are in a racist and patriarchal system  Claiming that a white person has more power for being white is to increase that difference in power and it is racist the same with men  On the other hand to claim that women or Afro descendants have more power is to reduce this inequality of power because it is to grant more power to those who are currently oppressed and expelled from the spaces of power 
Feminism,1615415502,Is this the    s  Are people still saying  girl power anymore   But anyway to answer your question   how many girls or even women have been popes bishops presidents prime ministers imperial powers warlords  hmm even that term seems to give the answer  or in any significant way had the power and force of the state to impose their will on others  Seems kind of obvious to me how that is different from  white power  
Feminism,1615414950,I think you re focusing too much on what you re calling basically  arsehole behaviour  An important thing to understand about toxic masculinity is that it s less about behaviour and more about the societal expectations that compel that behaviour the kind of thing you re looking at  is one example in which say a man is expected to respond to an insult with violence  or at least the threat of violence  or else he is weak and unmanly  But toxic masculinity manifests in other ways Just a couple of days ago a friend of mine ended up alone in the drink next to his upside down boat in an inlet in the damned Pacific with no lifejacket no radio and bad chances It was sheer dumb luck that another boat just happened to go past him and hear him yelling for help and plucked him  and his dog out of the water He d been in the water quite a while by that point and likely wouldn t have lasted much longer But just try suggesting to this guy  I love him but he makes bad choices sometimes that perhaps he should have a life vest when he s on the water and carry a handheld radio on his person or maybe attach his damn killswitch cord when he s running   good luck Because he s apparently more afraid of looking scared or not brave or not tough and specifically  not manly  than he is of death itself This is the kind of toxic masculinity that gets a lot of men killed  and nearly killed him on Monday Another example is men not reporting sexual assaults against them because they re worried that by asserting that they didn t enjoy it they re somehow not  real men  Or men not reporting domestic violence because allowing oneself to be abused by a woman makes one a weakling So we re not just talking about  arsehole behaviour here We re talking about a whole societal notion of what a  real man ought to be  a notion that can be held by men and women both  and examining just how destructive and at times lethal it can be 
Feminism,1615413605,I really dislike the term  toxic masculinity  mostly because I hate the term  toxic   but I think you re overlooking what the term is trying to get at a little bit Feelings of aggression are not intrinsically wrong In fact very few feelings or even impulses are wrong in and of themselves What s  wrong is the actions you take because of them It s not wrong to be angry but when angry is the only emotion deemed legitimate to express and only in specific ways that is very much a problem Your experiences with expressing your emotions or your friends experiences may be different and that s great I ve noticed a lot of younger men who feel comfortable expressing a wide range of emotions Personally as a queer person I ve mostly lived in progressive communities and while I ve had a couple run ins with homophobia I really haven t experienced all that much and don t usually even think about it when I m out with friends or partners But that does not mean that my experience is the same as other queer people Similarly where gender socialization is concerned there s research out there that paints a different picture of male socialization one which may not affect your generation but certainly affects many men in their late   s and   s If you have access to a library database you can search for this research yourself A quick search of my own brought up the following research  Confirming Gender Stereotypes A Social Role Perspective        which found that when men were put in high stakes and emotionally vulnerable situations they were significantly more likely to conform to gender stereotypes   Silence and  in visibility in men s accounts of coping with stressful life events        which looks at strategies men use to mask stress and anxiety and  Individual Differences in Masculine Gender Socialization as Predictive of Men s Psychophysiological Responses to Negative Affect        There s a lot of literature out there which is worth exploring  gt a woman can do a lot when she s all powerful Patriarchy is a  structure  not an individual Women can also reinforce patriarchy   and in the case of powerful women they often must do so to get where they are

Feminism,1615413416,Technically don t all actors always have makeup on in movies  All jokes aside you re right For the most part  There are exceptions The Walking Dead for example    thank goodness the producers were sensible enough to save most of the makeup for the zombies  Ok Clearly it s time for a nap Then perhaps we could all be inspired to write a more realistic screenplay 
Feminism,1615412168,What happened to u oracular duck If you don t mind me asking 
Feminism,1615410522,You were given an example of toxic masculinity being that men and boys are told to  man up and not given the emotional tools or support to deal with distress Statistically men are far more likely to have successful suicide attempts Men deserve to have the same level of support in times of crisis as women 
Feminism,1615410288,I ve watched the show some time ago so I have a fading impression The rape scene in the first episode The show touched the topic to show off it s gritty atmosphere which it lost right after While I think art can touch every topic this was done disrespectfully and only for shock value The female characters in the scene were drawn in a way where it seemed to fetishize the act The male characters simply got killed Regarding the fan service I remember it having the red haired farm lady with her breasts taking up half of the screen and defying laws of gravity 
Feminism,1615410252,I think that lots of man view the term  toxic  masculinity as an attack but they don t fully understand it It may not be the absolute best terminology but it is true  It is true that men have much worst outcomes when in it comes to suicide medical outcomes and can often suffer from mental health because they don t seek support Toxic masculinity refers to social standard where men must be stoic not show emotion and not seek out help Think of it more as gendered standards that are enforced on men and ultimately have negative outcomes When people say  remove gender from society they are generally referring to the erosion of gender roles For example men can do jobs traditionally held by women I would agree with you that there have been female world leaders that have done terrible things I think the fact that the vast majority the worlds leaders are men is the issue 
Feminism,1615409998,Exhausting yes but by r askfeminists standards I wouldn t call him a troll  Granted that s a low bar 
Feminism,1615409864,Even America had restrictions on male voting rights  So again feminists have spun a dishonest reading of history
Feminism,1615409799,Just because you personally haven t experienced it doesn t mean it doesn t happen but your experiences aren t the norm   gt men who rape are egotistical arseholes who feel that they can loose masculinity if they don t control the surroundings   But they re still men who are convinced that dominating women sexually is necessary to be masculinity That s what toxic masculinity is We know that but a lot of men don t that s why we talk about it 
Feminism,1615409512,agreed and it was especially bad around   s with all the govinda stuff raging I still don t think that it s upon the movies to teach kids the meaning of consent it s upon the parents and schools and that has been happening now also a bigger hindernce in putting it all together is the uneven nature of laws in India the laws around rape especially after nirbhaya episode tilted in favor of women  and a man still is mocked if he presses a rape charge against a woman  see honestly what you re describing is bad parenting it s upon parents and schools to impart that knowledge to teach the difference between good and bad touch and to teach the concept of consent but to address your point further if a woman rapes a man   i won t automatically say that she did so because of femininity or that it s toxic  that s where my gripe lies because suggestions like toxic masculinity gives off a vibe that it s somehow ok or masculine to rape which it absolutely isn t  also i hope you broke every fuckin bone in the body of that  year old bastard A similar incident happened with me where a guy slapped my sister and safe to say i got a bloodied face and he had to get his nose reconstructed 
Feminism,1615408776,Regarding your last sentence they know and they don t care If a woman dies from lack of access in any way they will blame her in some way shape or form The politicians who propose and vote for these measures have money and connections to get abortions for their family and mistresses if needed plus the pull to silence those who perform them They re about as  pro life as a land mine but no matter they ll be cheered on by idiots   Arkansas has a lot of abstinence only  sex ed and the highest teen pregnancy rate so as we can see their methods don t work Again no matter the results don t mean shit as long as you can pretend to be  pro life  even as the bodies pile up 
Feminism,1615408675,I m from India and the culture does not teach people the concept of consent As you ve probably seen Indian movies and culture in general normalizes stalking street harassment and sexual assault A  year old touched my little sister inappropriately when she was  years old This and other experiences people have shared with me tells me that sexual assault is not some isolated behavior of some arseholes It is a systemic cultural problem that women s rights are not valued No one is actively teaching boys to rape but many of them grow up without understanding what consent is because sexual assault is so commonplace 
Feminism,1615408302,and i respectfully diagree with that position I don t know where exactly is this thing of  emotions makes you less of a man going on I ve never seen this displayed once in person and the only time i ve heard  men don t cry was when i was crying in a friend s arms and he told me that in the most calm and caring way there was no force to stop me from crying only a suggestion that sounded more like  it s ok things will be fine  other than that i ve never once witnessed this idea that emotions make a man less manly in real life the idea is only visible in movies and even then it sounds like a projection to show the  Hero image  I agree and that s why i feel it s a stupid thing to suggest men who rape are egotistical arseholes who feel that they can loose masculinity if they don t control the surroundings i mean when has fear of lack of control a sign of masculinity I d go as far as to say always being uncomfortable in your surroundings and trying to make things the way you are otherwise it s a threat is probably anti masculine it s a type of behavior psychotic arseholes engage in 
Feminism,1615407391,or it can simply be that men are more effective at suicide like i stated more women attempt suicide but the methods women employee are weak if i am to accept your position then it should be inferenced that more men  attempt suicide when in reality they don t  men use methods like guns to kill themselves which is instantaneous death women use methods like pills that give them a window where they can be saved it s simply the effectiveness of method that s employed  to accept your position data must show that more men are attempting suicide    which simply isn t the case   
Feminism,1615407124,No this guy is a troll We don t want him in r menslib 
Feminism,1615406945,Regarding suicide stats show that men seek mental health support at significantly lower rates than women This is typically considered to be a result of the perceived stigma associated with men admitting acknowledging that they are struggling with problems like depression 
Feminism,1615406597,Oh definitely I guess my point was more  that if I m in a shop I don t mind people talking to me  if it s spontaneous about something random and not about hooking up dating To be honest I quite like those small interactions and have met a few good friends in very random situations 
Feminism,1615406517,  what about it it only shows that more men commit suicide than women  I mean i ve seen this thrown around so many times by both sides Look at the suicide rate   what does tell exactly women try to attempt more but men die more because of suicide as they employ effective measures the group with highest rates of suicide in     is still men aged       since you mentioned suicide here s another interesting stat the     figures suggest that life expectancy of men in UK is     years while it s     years for females on an average a female lives longer than a man       text Figure       Life   expectancy   at   birth amp text By          life   expectancy   in      see   Figure      How does that prove there s patriarchy in UK if anything it proves that women have it better than men and live longer in UK 
Feminism,1615406110,I just want to state that what I m about to say isn t an accusatory statement whatsoever I have a great piece of advice about her content if you identify as a feminist You know all the parts of Roma Army s content that you look at and deem as anti women misogynistic This is the same way many men feel about many feminists due to the ones that approach feminism in the way she approaches men s rights  and there are many women that do some going far enough to proudly declare themselves misandrists  Not saying all women who are feminists do but there are many out there that do The way a group is viewed is as an average of all the views of the people who declare themselves a part of said group Each time a man comes into contact with a misandrist who declares themselves a feminist it hurts the collect view and good faith of all the other feminists out there That s why it s so important to speak up about the negatives you see within the groups you associate with This isn t meant to be an attack on feminists this goes for men s rights activists as well or really any group We tend to immediately defend a cause from our point of view not realizing there are people out there identifying in the same groups as us but not acting right This is something we all know instinctively but I think we get so attached to our group identities we get in the us vs them mentality where we can t accept even earnest genuine criticism 
Feminism,1615406052,Yeah watch it again through a feminist lense It s pretty bad Even the way they manage and justify their career moves are through this gendered angle that isn t ever addressed or called out The whole series had a LOT of problems in hindsight It s an interesting time capsule 
Feminism,1615405946,I understand that But no couple can realistically be the  happily ever after Disney couple right It always seemed to me that the appeal of the portrayal on Marshall and Lily s relationship came from the fact that they were a realistic couple that yes loved each other deeply but would also act selfishly and hurt each other from time to time but always would end up talking through it They would held grudges for past actions but still try to overcome them But that might be an idealized version of them I have in my mind 
Feminism,1615405943,Perhaps you should look up the disparity between suicide rates of men and women in the UK There s your objective evidence

Feminism,1615404812,I mean I think there are certain ways that social interactions absolutely do work to preserve inequality  I think that learning to  look out for these things can end up turning on you and becoming a new form of hyper vigilance for women and other marginalized people  So rather than pointing to specific things that are  red flags that someone isn t a feminist  I think it s safe to just talk about feelings If you are feminist and in conversation feel safe about honestly expressing that  then likely you are in a safe relationship with someone who isn t going to go out of their way to harm you on the basis of your identity or gender  If someone says things or behaves in a way that makes you feel unsafe or uncomfortable  you can try to approach that person and have a conversation about it and hopefully clear up a misunderstanding or some thoughtlessness on their part or if what they said or did is a boundary violation for you disengage and do your best to avoid that person in the future as you would anyone else who seemed to be making you feeling uncomfortable or unsafe on purpose The thing that s hardest is that you cannot always avoid or disengage and unsafe person or situation or sometimes because the situation is so unsafe  you can t even reflect fully on whats going on and might only feel that way in retrospect  that s okay You won t have the energy or capacity to respond to every moment what matters is your ability to eventually get to safety and to heal from difficult experiences  gt Which isn t entirely possible in loud settings or when someone is bombarding another persons mental state all the time If someone is   bombarding  another person in any way for any reason  all the time    that is the red flag That is that person demonstrating that they don t notice or care about the boundaries of others A person like that is typically not a safe person to discuss sensitive issues with

Feminism,1615403645,i agree that s why i said ceremonial monarch and added the point of Thatcher and May 
Feminism,1615403570,But    let s  not catastrophise Keep  the vibes    positive    my dude  
Feminism,1615403393,Eh Victoria was not particularly politically educated and her first Prime Minister Melbourne was a considerable mentor to her and exerted a lot of influence  And yes there were something like twenty prime ministers during her reign  Prime ministers absolutely were a thing   Elizabeth II has never had any political power merely ceremonial  In regards to England   the Anglican Church didn t ordain women until      and women could not be consecrated as bishops until       Married women weren t allowed to hold property until       Women couldn t vote until      limited suffrage for women over   who owned property began in        Peerage laws still are male primogeniture not absolute primogeniture   with the exception of the monarch peerage titles and lands still go to the eldest son  Land and title passing from father to son and excluding daughters is kind of the most old school definition of patriarchy 
Feminism,1615403264,No i actually looked up for terms like  when did UK became a democracy and it gave a bbc article about the peoples act of       that s how i assumed it was a monarchy before that cause the Viceroys here in India were subjects to the Queen after UK took over in      i do admit that i made a judgement of error there though  i ll check out the menslib sub thanks i just hope they aren t radical because it triggers bad memories thanks again 
Feminism,1615402845,I mean you could read about Queen Victoria and the history of parliament and the prime minister on Wikipedia  It seems like you didn t even take  minutes to do research before posting baseless claims here and asking people to take the time to refute you  My advice to you in general if you re actually interested in learning about gender issues is to take responsibility for your own education  Find some articles books podcasts youtube channels whatever  If you make a polite request in a new post here or in r menslib I m sure you d get some good recommendations I m serious about checking out menslib those guys are pretty cool 
Feminism,1615402774,well thank i ll look into it a little deeply now  but honestly i still don t find it quite convincing that it was all due to patriarchy and that in case of Victoria there was absolutely no sway or control over her subjects her prime ministers were powerful sure but she still had a lot of sway over them  also i d like to add that i wrote for Elizabeth  the current queen and not the first one and that s why i said a ceremonial monarch because of the whole constitutional monarchy thing in her reign it has happened twice that the two most powerful positions in UK were both with women   first in the case of Thatcher and recently under Theresa may  bur yes i ll look more intothings you suggested thanks
Feminism,1615402442,Nope Victoria was not an absolute monarch at all  And Prime Ministers were very very much a thing during her reign  Walpole was the first PM and I think that was the      s 
Feminism,1615402130,Even if we had legislators with a spine there s nothing they could do bar pass a bill that d be blocked by a federal judge within an hour  Republicans covered their bases with this a long time ago In the   s they pushed for an expansion of the lower courts to ensure the SCOTUS never got overburdened which as it was a     moderate conservative majority at the time they intended to destroy the prior precedent for packing so that it could reign unchallenged and unchanged for decades Reagan then started the idea of swapping out the moderate conservative majority on that court with radicals that could serve a solid far right wing agenda but was blocked with people like Bork because the Dems had the senate Things then deradicalized for a few decades but now the GOP is back to those same principles and ideas and thanks to the lower court expansion   years ago have wiped out the previous precedent for court packing So the only way to stop them now is not to give them anymore seats  Breyer and then win the next few elections so that we can replace Thomas and Alito 
Feminism,1615402114,i did say i find some of it India but honestly i found none in London 
Feminism,1615402032,afaik Victoria was an absolute monarch and the concept of Constitution and prime ministers came much later  as for constraints i think those hold true irrespective of the gender of monarch   isn t it i mean it s a bit difficult to digest that a man as a king would hold more freedom and control over his subjects than say a woman as queen  i mean truth be told i originally intended this post for men only and that s why i posted it on askmen i have had a few bad experiences with some radicals feminists in past and i am basically someone who s in once bitten twice shy situation when it comes to someone who say they re a feminist A user told me to post it here otherwise he thought i am just circlejerking for karma which i never really understood If i wanted karma i d post a cat gif on r aww   anyways thanks a lot

Feminism,1615401870,If you can t see toxic masculinity at all in India or the UK you are deliberately avoiding looking 
Feminism,1615401828, gt Victoria was a monarch and controlled UK for a good  decades as a dictator even under Elizabeth the UK is a constitutional monarchy with the ceremonial head as a woman how exactly is UK a patriarchy when for the majority of last two centuries it was under Women first literally and then figuratively  Well if you know much about English history I don t know how you can point to Elizabeth as anything other than an example of how the country was very much a patriarchy then  Her father divorced his wife of over two decades broke with the Catholic church and beheaded a woman all to get a son  beheaded another woman for infidelity too and divorced another under the guise that she wasn t attractive enough though his own impotence was probably more of an issue there   That Elizabeth was the  Virgin Queen and never married was precisely because of patriarchy  Any man she married would have been King of England and the English absolutely did not want a foreign king and there was too much court in fighting for anyone to accept a fellow lord as King  Plus there was all the drama with the Protestant leaders especially those in Scotland having a big issue with Queens ruling especially if that made them head of the church as well  Was quite the issue for Elizabeth and her cousin Mary Queen of Scots  Just because due to her brother s sickliness and dying young her father s illegitimate sons all dying young and her older sister s death Elizabeth managed to get on the throne doesn t mean the entire system wasn t quite patriarchal   By Victoria s reign the monarchy s power was by no means absolute and the Prime Ministers during her reign  all of whom were men had quite a bit of power themselves  Worth noting too that at the time Victoria came to the throne married women were not allowed to hold property in their own name among a great number of restrictions of rights  That every so often due to deaths and lack of male heirs a woman gets on the throne really doesn t prove England was not a patriarchy especially if you look at the history of primogeniture and entail  I mean it s been in the   st century when they finally changed the rule so that the first born child of the monarch regardless of gender would inherit  Before that it was always the firstborn son

Feminism,1615401434,agreed but then i just don t see any evidence for such toxic masculinity happening around for most part neither in India and especially not it UK without giving out much details i went through normal schools and universities  had a healthy mix of men and women in my circle and i never really saw men not opening up  i mean sure  women were more expressive at times but men too in different situations the only time i can think of this expression of  toxic masculinity was during the infamous Delhi rape case when the interview of the rapist came out we weren t like   he is a male and hence he s toxic and scum    it was simply agreed that he was an arsehole and had it been a woman in his place the same thing would be said  that s what i meant when i said that the term toxic masculinity seems like a projection and i feel really put off when someone suggest  teach your boys not to rape  i mean come on are parents really teaching their boys that it s ok to rape or is it just arsehole behavior that s projected on men I am yet to meet men who believe that despicable behavior like rape can be justified in any form

Feminism,1615400977,I don t really feel like arguing with you about it Take me at my word or don t 
Feminism,1615400867,That doesn t have anything to do with what I ve said 
Feminism,1615400835,but extremes are and correct me if i am wrong   manifest only in certain situations and that s when it becomes arshole behavior innit sure at extremes aggression can be really harmful if it s used as method only to abuse someone   but that doesn t invalidate the whole feeling of agression as bad or toxic  no i respectfully disagree I mean i ve been around men s  groups throughout my life but i never once heard these expressions like  men don t cry taught as solid lines on stone for most part they were said with compassion and  a way to suggest  it s fine  honestly i ve seen all my close friends cry in front of me  ask for help when they needed and i did the same a few times the only difference i noticed was that the need was communicated non verbally and we kinda understood when interventions were needed  aren t we already doing that i mean some of the top most chefs in the world are men some of the sharpest CEO s and politicians in the world are women I admit it might be a little evident in India but in UK   i saw none of those constraints at least not in my workplace and industry  but a woman can do a lot when she s all powerful she can induce structures where more representation of woman is visible she can create laws and ordeals that might affect conditions of women if we assume that patriarchy was putting women at a disadvantage previously 
Feminism,1615400214,The term  toxic masculinity does   not  mean that masculinity masculine traits etc are inherently  toxic  The term is used to describe how specific ideas of masculinity are thrust upon men in ways that are toxic to them and to others For example being naturally stoic is not an inherently toxic trait Making a man believe that he must be stoic and not express his emotions lest he seem like  less of a man is toxic That man may have emotions that need a healthy outlet and if he does not think he should seek one he may suffer negative effects to his own mental health and or take out his emotions in unhealthy ways on others 
Feminism,1615400024, toxic masculinity was coined in the   s by the mythopoetic men s movement not by Gillette in       toxic masculinity does not mean that all men or masculinity is bad it is a specific term used to discuss aspects of traditional masculinity that when borne out to their extremes hurt men and others around them the idea that  men should just cry more is an extreme oversimplification the only socially approved method of emotional expression for men is anger we tell men from day  that  boys don t cry   man up   tough it out  etc like why do you think men are so reluctant to ask for help if they are suffering from anxiety depression etc  we don t raise boys with the emotional toolboxes they need to work through a lot of feelings and emotions that they  just like any other person  has  feminists want to remove gender is also not really the case most feminists advocate for the end of gender  roles  we don t want to make it so that gender does not exist or is not known we just want people to feel free to do whatever they want outside of the constraints of what we think men or women  should be do look like act like patriarchy    men bad patriarchy is also not disproven by having a female political leader if    of your government is male having a female political leader doesn t mean much

Feminism,1615467325,I can t remember the name of the book though That s why I m asking I figure I may come across it if I keep looking  There were specific workhouses for unwed mothers as well in Victorian England  can t recall what happened to them later  And the pushback against these shelters in USA was precisely because they were for fallen women who society didn t think were worthy of aid Except I don t have a source for any of this since I can t remember the name of the book 
Feminism,1615467062, gt Sorry I mean why is objectification dehumanizing Because we are not objects We are sentient we feel we experience the world we re aware We re alive Saying someone is an object is saying they re not alive or that their life has no value or worth   gt Why is this a bad thing Wouldn t you say that a person s body is a thing Would you be happy if people treated your body like a meatsack A vessel Would you like to be groped or handled as a thing Because that s what we do with objects  The body itself can be a  thing  however humans and animals aren t simply their bodies We have consciousness awareness sentience But for you knowledge even when a human is non aware in a coma it s a human not a thing    gt   Object a thing that you can     see       or     touch       but that is not usually a     living        animal        plant     or     person          gt A specific individual material entity especially one that is not living or not sentient     amp  x   B  gt It seems to me like the bad part is the presumably unwanted invasive sexualization and not the objectification  Objectification doesn t need to be sexual as I stated and exemplified with the Holocaust analogy Hitler objectified non aryans and didn t needed to sexualize them

Feminism,1615466303,Wow Fantastic take As a dude this tracks very well with my own experiences 
Feminism,1615465705, gt Objectification means that you reduce a WHOLE PERSON  with personality values ideals dreams opinions feelings and all that stuff you know  to their bodies and looks So far I would agree  gt This is dehumanizing  To me objectification is treating something as an object but not claiming it to be  just that object especially not outside of the scope of the objectification Hence if I were to objectify someone I d still recognize the rest of their personhood but just not concern myself with it in the particular matter  gt Their opinions and feelings do not matter because they are not humans but objects To me the notion of something being human and and an object are not mutually exclusive A peron s body is an object to me that doesn t detach the rest of that person from the human  personality values ideals dreams opinions feelings though and thus the objectification doesn t grant me the right to treat them as  just objects like you go on 
Feminism,1615465495, gt Why Could you elaborate For example the Holocaust Hitler only considered important valuable esteemed those who were Aryans They were true Germans So therefore anyone who didn t fit his standards didn t had worth so could be killed and enslaved  Hitler didn t saw fellow humans as equals he took their humanities when stated that they could be killed enslaved and that their lives didn t mattered   gt Could you define your interpretation of  objectification for me please  Objectification is treating people and animals sometimes as objects as things  Through the course of history women couldn t vote couldn t decide their futures couldn t choose their spouses They were objects of bargain marriage was created to form alliances This still happens as a group treatment thankfully in the west things are more progressive however many countries and regions still remain this behaviors bounded by law or not   gt Objectifying to me means focusing on the body of someone  This objectification is sexualization but objectification does necessarily means something sexual   gt but I don t see how that s enabling someone to now  own them  In milder cases saying someone s ass is nice doesn t always translate as disrespect and objectifying However if this someone goes up to a stranger and say this randomly in a  non appropriate place such as club  where maybe the stranger is there to flirt or not  this can be seem as objectifying because you merely say something invasive about someone s body regardless of how they ll feel  In worse cases men will see women s bodies as vessels for them So they ll abuse grope assault and rape them Because women s no is not relevant for them 
Feminism,1615465172,Most rapists aren t motivated by a strong desire for sex Generally it s about power because they can not because they are so sexually frustrated they just have to have sex 
Feminism,1615464796, gt When this is done in a structural level you literally considers less human  Why Could you elaborate  gt When women as a group are objectified Under my current understanding of  objectifying  the notion of objectifying a group of people is incoherent so I guess it s really a different semantic interpretation of  objectification  Could you define your interpretation of  objectification for me please Objectifying to me means focusing on the body of someone without denying them the rest of their personhood but merely not concerning yourself with it at that moment I would expect something like someone saying  they have a nice ass to be seen as objectification but I don t see how that s enabling someone to now  claim them as their ownership 
Feminism,1615464624,What is NOT wrong with objectification Objectification means that you reduce a WHOLE PERSON  with personality values ideals dreams opinions feelings and all that stuff you know  to their bodies and looks This is   dehumanizing    Objectification of women is one of the major causes why many women and young girls starting from the age of   have physical and psychological health problems related to their looks such as eating disorders anorexia anxiety depression  More importantly it is one of the building blocks of the notion that women are bodies and commodities that are owned by others and exist for others This notion is exactly the reason why women are not seen as equals and are mistreated abused violated  Their opinions and feelings do not matter because they are not humans but objects so I can treat them however I like  Sounds plausible right Consider how black people are still being mistreated abused and violated today because they were enslaved owned and not seen as equals by white people for centuries Consider the mass murder of the  uncivilized Native Indians by the  civilized white men and the mass murder of the  untermensch Jews by the   bermench Nazis Objectification leads to dehumanization which in turn leads to violence and social injustice This is not a far fetch but a psychological fact 
Feminism,1615464303,The root of it in the US seems to be the grip that Christianity still has on some people Always amazes me looking across the Atlantic and seeing attitudes that seem hundreds of years out of place Not trying to demean all Christians though just an observation 
Feminism,1615464274,You know despite commenting earlier re size strength differences in men and the likelihood of female sexual assault i think your  benevolent sexism angle makes sense   Walking non woman friends home is good too  We should all look out for each other for sure 
Feminism,1615463129,Everything  But ok let me break it down  When you objectify a person you dehumanizes them which means you compare and atributes value as if they were the same as a chair When this is done in a structural level you literally considers less human even if they re the same species as you and sentient When women as a group are objectified men as the power holding group and majority think that they own these  objects   Which leads us to fathers thinking they own their wives and daughters and can say what they dress with what they can watch where they can go etc When romantic partners do this is the same and sometimes these objectification causes the death of these women who seemingly can t make their own decisions if these men don t approve it

Feminism,1615461265,There is no fucking egalitarian movement or coherent philosophical tradition It s a word misogynist men use to invalidate feminism I don t have patience for your type 
Feminism,1615460843,This is not a grand theory but when I m sexually frustrated I can just well masturbate  If I want to have a sex with a person to me it s more more about loneliness intimacy excitement validation connection It makes me wonder if men conflate a physical need with emotional status and identity needs 
Feminism,1615460174,Women experience sexual frustration we just don t tend to have a sense that we are entitled to have someone do something about it 
Feminism,1615460137,I m a woman that occasionally dates younger men My stance  in theory is that anyone over    the legal age of consent here is an adult deserves respect and is free to do what they want with who they want  That said there is a HUGE power difference that comes with age it s incredibly difficult to navigate and very easy to take advantage of Older people generally have more financial resources more self confidence know more about how the world works It s very easy to influence groom or manipulate a younger person who is still figuring themselves out I ve been very careful and I m still shocked at times to see what kind of influence I had on younger partners and friends I shudder to think what someone with bad or even callous intentions could do I m guessing society thinks it s not possible to take advantage of younger men as easy as younger women   You can use them for sex but that s what young men want in the first place right   The most vulnerable group of young men I ve seen are in their early   s They ve just finished college they don t have a job yet and don t have a girlfriend All of their college friends are getting jobs getting married and moving away while their own life seems to be in limbo The seem to literally exist in a vacuum waiting for their life to start but unable to get it started They are extremely susceptible to an older person just taking them under their wing  So um   in short there might be infantilization of younger women but a relationship with a significant age gap is a power imbalance that should be taken seriously in any relationship 
Feminism,1615460028,I agree I mean lots of women go through the same and they don t believe themselves entitled to men s bodies

Feminism,1615459541,thats an interesting article but i dont think it explains male privilege to      just one side of it  
Feminism,1615459534,If you mean it like that it s about as helpful as saying  people are atoms Obviously people are biological neural networks  well people are the rest of their bodies too but that s besides the point that s what brains are How is it relevant in any way You re trying to sound more scientific while your point isn t deep at all and doesn t really connect with the topic at hand very well at all 
Feminism,1615458860,A commenter on this sub linked this article recently and it s blown my mind  How Extreme Need Leads to Male Entitlement  
Feminism,1615458573,In addition to the other comments it s also a good idea to offer to walk men home  Don t know the crime statistics where you are but when I was young and lived in a city the area where I and most of my friends lived had a big issue with mugging and not so much with strangers assaulting or raping women walking alone and I had some guy friends who were mugged  none of the women in my circle were partly out of luck and partly because we were used to practicing situational awareness when alone and learned to be more safety conscious  I would say there is a bit of benevolent sexism to only asking women if they need a walk home but I put that more on a cultural issue rather than a you issue  we certainly hear a lot how things aren t safe for women and often they aren t so it s not bad to want to help keep people safe So long story short nothing wrong with offering respect the answer you get and it s also probably a good idea to offer anyone regardless of gender a walk home if you are someone with really good situational awareness personal safety habits 
Feminism,1615458509,People are neural networks Humans are not artificial neural networks yes The point is precisely in the need for conclusions with a lack of information  And learning of course 
Feminism,1615458265,To answer this you ll have to look back at the history of how women and their sexuality was and often still is treated to this very day For women talking about their sexuality over history it s been seen as taboo Or they ve been called terrible names for being sexually independent and making the choice to have sex It s still an issue with people today A lot of partners are obsessed with how much sexual experience their partner has Or if they won t have sex with one particular person there s a chance that she ll be called a prude Even women who don t feel sexual attraction like people who fall on the asexual spectrum are often told that having sex could  fix them Women have been taught to handle their own sexual frustrations Whereas men are often still encouraged to talk about having sex in a manner that they are getting something that they should all experience This is damaging to everyone since many of them aren t taught to handle their own sexual frustration in a healthy manner And women are left to minimize their own sexuality 
Feminism,1615458154,Of course women experience sexual frustration But women are conditioned to not talk so much about their sexual desire for fear of being labelled a slut or worse 
Feminism,1615457770,This is definitely something that s true if you watch British television then you can see it for sure In American women have some ridiculously high beauty standards thrown at them all the time From advertisements television magazines anything and you can probably find that it only has the prettiest women plastered on the front telling women that THIS is how they can look If only they put in a little effort and bought the products As for men in television if they re wanted to watch it then there is usually someone relatable to them Or someone that they want to be This is why you ll see the range from average looking guys up through model looking guys With average men they can relate to them and with good looking men that s someone that they might want to be  Women aren t expected to relate to characters on their looks 
Feminism,1615457528,Trigger warning on a comment Like you couldn t help but keep reading Oh man lawd
Feminism,1615457407,You don t see older women dating younger men nearly as much though when it does happen there s a big issue of a power imbalance I think a big term in all of this isn t infantilization but a type of grooming If someone takes a young vulnerable and socially dependant person and puts them in a situation they can t leave from easily it s sort of isolating them from what a typical situation for them at that age might be If there s any type of power imbalance in a relationship that makes it so someone else can t leave easily then there s a big issue overall

Feminism,1615457371,My country South Africa should serve as an example to many Since the fall of apartheid in South Africa the representation of black people in the media has both increased and become more realistic and nuanced as opposed to only hearing the propaganda of a racist regime   However a shift in the political class and shifts in representation alone do not translate into big changes within the economic structure of society As a white South African I live in what is essentially a bubble of first world amenities Whereas the majority of the population  black still live in deep poverty This is the lagacy of apartheid town planning  which was a more extreme version of redlining     This racist legacy is actually very persistent and has little to do with the  racist or otherwise attitudes of people now I live in a monster of a house that is worth literally millions which I could never have afforded on my current salary But my grandparents got it under the apartheid regime dirt cheap because it zoned and developed land for white people  Now my black colleagues who work with me earning similar or even more cannot afford to move into my area just as I could not I just happen to live there in a house in the richest area of my city already so don t need to earn enough money to pay millions for a house Also my ownership of this property means I can leverage it and aquire debt  if needed very easily at favourable rates because the banks see that asset in my portfolio Whereas for my black colleagues with the same salary are unable to leverage to get the same debt at favourable rates Which means in South Africa white people still  mostly live in rich areas and black people still  mostly live in poorer areas Now in that the laws of the country are no longer racist black people have trickled into my neighborhood   They however are not middle class because middle class couldn t actually afford to move into the area they are often rich  Disney is NEVER going to critique society at the level of economic structure It sells feel good attitudes to people and is very happy with the economic status quo because it sits up at the tops of that heirachy 
Feminism,1615457201,There are a lot of things that come into play when you re talking about why it takes so long for something like this to happen A good deal of societies used to see women as second class citizens we ve moved up in the world but there s still a lot of stigmas It takes a lot to change the hearts and minds of everyone on the planet And sometimes that s something you can t do in just one generation Some people just don t want to see others as equal you can see different occurrences of this all over the place If they look and see what they re doing is wrong then they have to admit that for their entire life they ve been doing it 
Feminism,1615457003,The question that s relevant here is did she ask you to walk her home It s true that you should hold the door out to anyone who is coming behind you And you should talk about how a meal is paid for Split it pay for your own half or take turns paying for the meal The thing about walking someone home is they have to trust you enough to let you know where they live  Especially if someone lives alone 
Feminism,1615456414,Okay Thanks I figured it wasn t really a good option but I m pretty socially inept and didn t know how else to approach lol 
Feminism,1615456250,Dangerous people would also say all those things so that doesn t really help  But when you offer to walk her home it s nice to make clear somehow that her refusing is an option and not a big deal to you like um   Hey it s late do you want me to walk you home If you prefer to go by yourself that s fine too   
Feminism,1615455912,I m from Scotland and as a kid used to truly wonder if the British were genetically inferior Like we ve been breeding within this tiny island for so long we ve messed up our gene pool thus creating vast differences in female attractiveness between here and the USA Then I spent some time there and realised I d been hoodwinked by the media   although our pasty skin could still do with some help

Feminism,1615455262,This wasn t something I even considered Would I just simply say straight out that I m not trying to find out where she lives for malicious intentions Or is there a better way to be reassuring Do friends worry about this as well If they agree to my question should I reassure them on the way to their home as well 
Feminism,1615454266,If you are in a date situation there s some additional concerns the women in question might question your motives about wanting to walk her home After you walked her home you know where she lives You may attempt to invite yourself in or use it as leverage    Well I walked all this way the least you can do is invite me in     These are certainly things that run through my mind when a date offers to walk or drive me home Which isn t to say   Don t do it   But it s good to keep in mind 
Feminism,1615453201,Basically every human is indoctrinated into gender roles from before they can walk talk and throughout most of their lives Its really difficult to shift at large scales views that are so ingrained that they appear almost axiomatic to most people I think that to me the only hope is gradual incremental change over generations 
Feminism,1615452867,Hey dude Amazing points you made Don t fret too much  for a lot of people speaking in general not meaning anyone specific   anyone that has a different view to them becomes a  mra or an  incel  Learn not to get too affected by it There are thousands and thousands of people who would probably agree with you just not on here   
Feminism,1615452479,Atleast you agree feminism is not for men    I mean its literally in the name FEMinism
Feminism,1615452056,I don t think it s sexist It makes sense for  on average physically larger and stronger people to protect physically smaller and weaker people women tend to be safer when accompanied by men and there is safety in numbers  The basic logic could apply to other situations  an abled person accompanying a disabled person or a person of the dominant local racial group accompanying someone of a less common group in a less accepting area There s only really a problem if the man views the women as inherently less competent and or tries to make her accept an escort  Not implying you ve done will do these  
Feminism,1615449452,A lot of media has a tendency to portray bigotry as actions by individuals towards individuals and the solution to bigotry as individuals changing their individual behaviors  This is a lazy copout Racism isn t just the kkk burning wooden crosses or neonazi chanting about Jews replacing them Racism is when Black men receive harsher punishments than white men for the same crimes degrading Black neighborhoods ability to recovery economically Racism is when doctors don t know what it looks like when a Black woman is in pain Racism is when Donald Trump gets away with serial rape but Anthony Weiner goes to prison for sexting Most importantly racism is a system most of us contribute to by participating in the institutions that impose it   Sexism is likewise systemic but I m not the best person here to go into detail about that  From that perspective Ellis is right bigotry can t be overcome with platitudes and tokenism because it requires us to recognize our role in it and work towards dismantling norms and institutions It doesn t matter how many people see a Black protagonist in Princess and the Frog if we don t address redlining and generational poverty  Of course representation has value which I assume that Lindsay mentions But representation alone does not undo oppression no matter how good and unracist unsexist we feel while watching it

Feminism,1615439991,In addition to ugly men appearing on tv and movies they also don t need to be good at acting  Talented women struggle to get roles if they aren t exceptionally beautiful or if they are past   years old Even if they do end up getting a role it is usually acting to be someone s mother or some other minor role behind a man  If a woman if described as ugly she usually is a gorgeous famous actress wearing glasses braces and messy hair and still by the end of the film turns out to be beautiful after all while the  lesson of the film being that looks don t matter  Anne Hathaway in Devil wears Prada America Ferrera in Ugly Betty

Feminism,1615438651,Hey dude just wanted to throw out a thank you for asking the question in such a thoughtful way     I find  chivalry to be sexist and i don t generally like being treated different on the basis of my sex  But there are undeniable biological differences where the average male body is stronger than the average female body and then of course women are more likely to be targeted by sexual predators   So as a woman i have appreciated guy friends or partners who care about my safety and offer to walk me home 
Feminism,1615438221,I think the more precise question to ask is are we okay with this double standard White power and  male power  no one really uses that one have been historical phenomena with violent genocidal histories Whereas things like  black power or  girl power  a rather dated phrase represent an affirmation of the value of historically marginalized groups in society White male power seeks to dominate others whereas black girl power seeks to fight back against that domination Because recent history is worse with one it elicits a stronger visceral disgust towards it The problem I see is that shunning one while permitting the other does leave open the potential for people to abuse it like with redefining racism as being  prejudice plus power  which is clearly a self serving modality to excuse black racism While one wrong is worse than the other we should acknowledge that two wrongs still don t make a right 
Feminism,1615438068,Nope  I ve sometimes been walked home by others and I have walked others home  and I used to live as a man before I transitioned If things are likely not safe or if someone is tipsy or may not be able to defend themselves it is a pretty decent thing to do    If you have men in your life who are in a vulnerable state you better make the offer to them too  only making the offer to women can be sexist

Feminism,1615435492, I ve noticed it also   Others have commented on British TV  I ve been watching an interesting French TV dramady on Netflix  Call My Agent  about a talent agency in Paris  The difference between the women in it and those on many American shows is immediately noticeable  One of the lead characters would never appear on an American show because of her nose  Early on the show made a point of emphasizing how how American female actors are constantly pressured into plastic surgery when one of the French women is pressured and declines  I think the wide range of normal women on this French show is an essential part of this show s high quality by allowing for better character differentiation and depth 
Feminism,1615434389, gt rape is never considered  manly   Of course no one is going to admit to it When men are told that their masculinity is directly correlated with their partner count then you re going to see men getting sex by force This is what leads some men to commit rape and also leads to male rape victims of women rapists to be congratulated   Rape culture  I know you heard this term before is about acknowledging that certain commonly held beliefs result in rape and victim blaming    gt none of those behaviors are looked up as something to be positive    Yet so much rape persists
Feminism,1615433785,This is part of why I think I often prefer British tv shows as an American woman  that and I appreciate dry humor  
Feminism,1615433723,rape is never considered  manly  whacking a stranger on road for no apparent reason is never termed  manly  that s physical assault fighting your siblings for fun isn t physical attack and creating a submissive dominant equation between two consenting adult isn t rape  i don t know who s pushing this idea but no society or group of sane individual rewards  rape as manly behavior none of those behaviors are looked up as something to be positive about and this holds true even for the neckbeards who just want to fill their bellies with beer and ride their Harley 
Feminism,1615433590,I have noticed this as well In almost any British show I have caught people of all genders are only slightly above average in their attractiveness or average and it is their acting and character center stage That is not to say acting is not on point in American shows  it is but it definitely does seem there is more emphasis and necessity on having good looking people in the acting industry Some of my friends have noticed this too and in fact one of my best friends  who has watched a lot more shows than me pointed this out to me And of course that physical attractiveness emphasis and standard is disproportionately on women I do not know enough but I do wonder if this is a mirror to American society

Feminism,1615479806, gt many feminists refuse to work with groups like the MRA uh yeah we SHOULD be on the same side but they kind of fucking hate us their whole schtick is being reactionaries  against feminism and many  if not most of them are raging misogynists  gt egalitarians They re not a  group  They don t do anything They re just people who are at best fine with the status quo and at worst are just anti feminists who ve put on the mantle of  I just want equality to avoid looking sexist  gt even parts of the lgbt community What are you referring to here TERFs 
Feminism,1615479027, gt your data will be skewed by the fact that women fearing for their safety while outside at night may be less likely to be out late and therefore less likely to be victims of violent crime simply because they remain at home This is a super important point Women are also less likely to be outside  alone for similar reasons and thus are less attractive targets for robbery

Feminism,1615478824,From the abstract  Adjustment was made for prior mental health status   There was no significant association between number of sex partners and later anxiety and depression   Increasing numbers of sex partners were associated with   increasing risk of substance dependence disorde  r at all three ages  So it seems that the main correlation they found was about substance abuse not other mental illnesses This makes sense to me given that many drugs  especially stimulant like meth and cocaine can cause sharp increase in sex drive and decrease in inhibition leading to compulsive sexual behavior Addicts also report difficulty maintaining long term romantic relationship so it makes sense that they would switch partners more often than people with stable relationships 
Feminism,1615478652,In America  males experienced higher victimization rates than females for all types of violent crime except rape sexual assault   
Feminism,1615478313,Correct It s awful for all the reasons and often the acting suffers too I watch a lot of TV from abroad and I ve noticed this for decades 
Feminism,1615478262,Well if you re not interested in charitable discussion that is fine I never said all stories had to be economic or class stories did I  I never made any claims about revolutions you are putting things into my mouth and all I was trying to do was be honest and explain how I saw things You seem to be after a fight Perhaps someone else will be down for that   But not me well not today anyway 
Feminism,1615477955,Then you should be happy and thankful that Disney isn t trying to be anti capitalist Why do you want your revolution commodified Also why are people unable to accept that in a fictional world a monarchy isn t neccecarily an oppressive system like it is in real life since you know it s not real  So your saying that representation is a liberal thing and progressives generally don t see it as progressive unless it s in the       percent of movies that portray systems of oppression being dismanteled 
Feminism,1615477946,Agreed A couple of other possible aquatic GOAT nominees   Penny Dean   In      Dean swam the English Channel in      the first sub eight hour EC crossing in history  Her time was more than an hour faster than anyone had swum it before  I recall her saying that she could have gone faster but her pilot didn t believe she could go as fast as she knew she could So he chose a start time that given the tides wouldn t allow her to go faster than she did   Dean held the overall English Channel record for sixteen years and the women s record for twenty eight Only one person has held an English Channel solo record longer  Matthew Webb   EC swimmer    She was World Professional Marathon Swimming champion by a massive margin in      then went on to coach and help others make long swims She trained Chad Hundeby the guy who eventually broke her English Channel record                 Cynthia Nicholas   First woman to swim an English Channel two way        She beat the men s overall record by nine hours and   minutes Between     and      she was Queen of the Channel i e  she had swum the English Channel more than any other woman Allison Streeter took over in                      That s only a small part of what either of these amazing athletes accomplished  and in Dean s case  because she s still coaching  continue to accomplish

Feminism,1615477556,I don t really think this study shows that having multiple sexual partners is harmful or that  promiscuous sex causes or leads to depression anxiety and substance abuse issues I think what it shows is that certain risky behaviors and certain mental illnesses tend to coexist and having  promiscuous sex is classified as a risky behavior especially for women People with anxiety depression or other issues may self medicate which can include promiscuous sex and substance abuse Correlation is not causation here I also would like to know what the definition of  promiscuity is here People often talk about it as though it s some definite thing but when asked what that actually means don t seem to have a concrete answer Is it ten partners Twenty Thirty What about serial monogamy Occasional hookups or casual sex Some people think  five partners is  promiscuous  Is it I personally have zero issues with anyone having as much sex with as many people as they want provided the sex is consensual and they are engaging in mutually respectful safe encounters 
Feminism,1615477516,And being mugged is still influenced by gender I was mugged at knifepoint while in the woods with a partner a while back and he said a big reason he cooperated was his fear that I would be sexually assaulted Neither of us were concerned that  he might be sexually assaulted 
Feminism,1615477480,The question then becomes what you mean by progressive v standard liberal politics  Standard liberal politics is one which is only concerned with setting things up such that we have more women and black and black women billionaires They will set up some welfare programs unlike libertarians but finally when all is said and done the deep structural economic inequalities will remain Liberals are not racist but they are Capitalists Progressives as a political movement generally are like a Bernie Sanders or an AOC both are not racist and are interested in structural economic reforms   Reducing burdens created by massive inequality and setting up a system which minimizes the possibility of such inequalities to arise within the economy at all  Also don t under estimate Capitalism it will happily make a profit on anti Capitalist sentiment without blinking an eye Mass printing Che Guevara  a big anti capitalist icon on red t shirts and selling them to lefty teens from rich backgrounds is something Capitalists not only would do they do it  Disney s decisions with respect to all this is all about branding marketing and sales 
Feminism,1615477466,That s an interesting fact Women remaining at home for fear definitely needs to be taken into account Otherwise the analysis will be very much misleading
Feminism,1615477452,I mean a big part in why  equality wasn t achieved yet is that many feminists refuse to work with groups like the MRA egalitarians  even parts of the lgbt community
Feminism,1615477360,Yes so what Your try to justify and invalidate sexual objectification is getting weirder and weirder 
Feminism,1615477185, gt Men are way more likely to be victims of violent crimes when outside Are men more likely to be victims of violent crimes than women  when both are outside  or simply more likely to be victims of violent crimes than women are I ask because if you aren t comparing  men who are outside at night to  women who are outside at night  your data will be skewed by the fact that women fearing for their safety while outside at night may be less likely to be out late and therefore less likely to be victims of violent crime simply because they remain at home 
Feminism,1615477170,And that hinges on the definition of  object  does it not 
Feminism,1615477123,I would     rather be mugged than sexually assaulted or raped These two crimes are not comparable Someone taking your purse or wallet or watch or whatever sucks and is scary but you can replace those things 
Feminism,1615477045,I am neither a Democrat nor a liberal  though I realize some people use  liberal to mean  left   I believe that both Trump and Biden have a history of sexual assault as I suspect is the case for a large number of people wielding political power I like neither Biden s politics nor his history towards women I voted for Biden because US electoral politics is extraordinarily binary I don t consider elections to be my main theory of change and I don t think Biden  or the Democratic party will save us all I will continue to fight outside an electoral context for a better world 
Feminism,1615476925,You have to look up your local statistics I don t know where you live 
Feminism,1615476882,Haha this isn t about philosophy here You are looking into the wrong dictionary This is about objectification of people  
Feminism,1615476824,According to left wing people now respectful representation of women isn t progressive unless there s messages about dismantiling systems of oppression to back it up
Feminism,1615476754, gt unabh ngig vom Bewusstsein existierende Erscheinung der materiellen Welt auf die sich das Erkennen die Wahrnehmung richtet What part of being matter is dehumanizing As far as I m concerned everyone is always an object and objectification is the act of interpreting someone trough their object body alone without considering metaphysicals 
Feminism,1615476682,Yes it matters The point of this sub is so that people who come here can get a specifically feminist perspective from people who are educated on the topic Given that just yesterday you were asking to learn more about feminism and your demonstrated lack of familiarity with feminist discourse you are not qualified to give that perspective Your participation is relegated to nested comments only Further argument on this point will result in a ban 
Feminism,1615476583,That s correct There is also a handy picture example in the initial removal comment 
Feminism,1615476483,Objectification means  making someone into an object  Dehumanization is part of the definition 
Feminism,1615476361,Literally no one said that it s gonna fix everything But how does that mean that there s nothing progressive about it at all in other ways Also wouldn t you claim that Focus Features also has no interest in changing the economic structure that sets people at a disadvantage And yet they made a movie that tells the viewers that unionizing is good and storming a CEO s house is good So is it just Disney 
Feminism,1615476230,Honestly if you re adamant that objectification isn t dehumanizing there s only much I can argue  Humans don t see themselves as objects nor see animals or plants as objects A chair is an object a table a book But a cat is not an object it s a living being a dog is not an object At least for most humans it s this way as far as I perceive  If you don t think it is that s ok It s your opinion However women feel that is does dehumanize it Just because it does hurt you it doesn t mean it doesn t hurt others It requires empathy to understand this too 
Feminism,1615476134,No representation can be a good thing even without being attached to an economic critique People even those traditionally excluded from doing so have stories to tell of their lives that do not involve political or economic analysis   Allowing those stories to be told is good It allows us to see the humanity in each other But representation alone isn t going to be the magic bullet fix of the structural legacies we have inherited from our history Consider the one percent if grandfather s left the billions to grand daughters there would be more representation But the basic structure of wealth distribution would not have changed at all  Disney as I see it is kind of like that They have no problem with women or black people becoming super rich and moving into the    representation  But they have NO interest in changing the economic structure that set people at a disadvantage because they are beneficiaries of that system  I don t see disney as being  afraid necessarily more that a multinational organisation like Disney has no incentive to change how things are done having black and female executives is  good on the surface But the machine hidden beneath that service would remain largely untouched 
Feminism,1615475958, gt Objects are indeed required to be non living  anything that is visible or tangible and is relatively stable in form    something material that may be perceived by the senses    a material thing that can be seen and touched    in german but similar to before  
Feminism,1615475954,I feel like you re confusing liking someone s physical feature and objectification There s a clear distinction between the two Let s take your example You look at a woman You think she has a nice ass You approach and meet her In this example a couple of things matter First the look Is it a glance or a gaze Second the context Is this woman a business partner you meet in a professional setting Are you in a more comfortable setting like a party at a friend s house Third the encounter How do you approach her Are you polite Are you in a position maybe too close where you could possibly make her uncomfortable Let s say you see her at a party and think she is sexy In one scenario you approach her introduce yourself and start a conversation in a polite manner This is not objectification In another scenario you approach her check her out from head to toe and then say  hey sexy  This is objectification There s nothing wrong with liking someone s physical feature and being drawn to it This is completely natural There s nothing wrong with complimenting someone in a polite way either  obviously not like  you have a nice ass   What s wrong is to REDUCE people to their physical features consciously or subconsciously If you respect women and see them as humans you ll act like in scenario   If you subliminally think of women as objects you ll act like in scenario   Regardless of which both of these approaches are stemmed from your own perception of women That s why how you think of and perceive women matter quite a lot The thing is though while some men who have an objectifying sexist perception of women openly exhibit abusive and violent behavior physically and sexually many men who have the same perception of women do not act that way and they are not even aware of their own perception Objectification of women in media commercials movies porn perpetuates the notion that women are physical and sexual objects for male pleasure and they are not real human beings with their own desires opinions feelings etc As a result many men develop an unrealistic hypersexualized perception of women which manifests itself as emotional abuse and power play in close relationships and it harms women s emotional well being One example from my own life is my ex who loved me from the bottom of his heart acknowledged me as a person cared about my opinions Yet he used to criticize me for not being sexy      not wearing make up not being  feminine enough  According to him I was supposed to wear sexy outfits at home compromising my need of being comfortable in my safe space He wasn t even aware that he was asking me to act as a sexual object for his pleasure Objectification goes much further than it seems
Feminism,1615475721,I can justify calling the sexual harassment being bad because it can cause harm to the person I don t see the justification for calling the objectification bad without the definition of such making it inherently dehumanizing which is fair but not part of my initial interpretation question 
Feminism,1615475701,I haven t watched too many british shows A few which would you recommend  Definitly American shoes are gloomy looking men and beautiful young women as their partners etc unrealistic  We usually match with people who reflect our own level of attractiveness 
Feminism,1615475692,does it matter i can still make a comment you dont need to know everything about a subject to talk about it
Feminism,1615475656,OK got It no problem  I m not the smartest person and I m really bad with the internet   Englisch is not my first language   Could you please tell me what  nested comments are it s just not the first comment right I can still post as the second comment right  
Feminism,1615475587, gt I think you re confusing objectification in the sense of  to acknowledge the physicality of a person with the one that is meant when people discuss  objectification which is  to focus on the physical attributes of a person to the exclusion of all else   No I do think of the second interpretation but very limited in application The example I ve used to far being that I see a person in a bar or something and objectify them to essentially perform  visual attraction analysis if that makes sense I acknoledge the entirety of the person but only consider their physicality for that moment that is everything else is not part of my conscious thought So indeed reducing them to nothing but physical attributes but keeping in mind that those are only a part of what makes the person whole as well as not letting that objectification being a salient factor of your interpretation of them as a person in the long term  gt You claim to think about people s bodies without losing sight of their personhood thoughts feelings etc In which case you are not objectifying them You are thinking about their physical bodies sure but not to the exclusion of other factors That is not what is meant by the term used in feminism  and broader when people discuss objectification You seem to be on board with the idea that reducing people only to their physical traits and ignoring all else about them stripping them of thoughts feelings agency is bad So you a likely going to agree that objectification in that sense which is the one meant when people discuss how objectification is harmful is not a good thing and has the potential to be harmful That seems to be the conclusive answer 
Feminism,1615475289, gt I believe victims But isn t that statement circular reasoning  It presupposes that the alleged victim is in fact a victim  The revelation that she lied under oath repeatedly is devastating to her credibility

Feminism,1615475016,She says that there s nothing progressive at all about representation unless it s backed by a deep analysis of structures and hierarchies  She doesn t once state how they could have made remakes of Aladdin and The Lion King with these messages appropriate for  year olds Also anti capitalists who think that they d be happy with Disney if they did make movies like this are wrong If they did anti capitalists would get angry at them for  commodifying the revolution So you should be glad that they aren t
Feminism,1615474909,I mean   okay My life is perfectly fulfilled without children and yours may not be and that s fine It s not  sad  it s just different people wanting different things out of life It s also rather rude to assume that someone cannot or is not  educating and forming the next generation because they do not have children of their own That is far and away not the only way to contribute 
Feminism,1615474886, gt You plainly ignored the two sources I provided  How is conceeding that based on the alternate interpretation of  object  you can indeed call objectification bad  ignoring those sources They form a centerpiece of my argumemt now  gt However I think you do need to realize or at least respect that just because you don t understand a concept or a logic it doesn t mean it s incorrect  Which is why I have conceeded given the alternative interpretation of  object   gt Objectification is harmful to women Women feel bad bothered and disgusted Do you understand this If going by the definition of object that requires it to be non living i e objectification  is intrinsically dehumanizing yes 
Feminism,1615474741,So the only way for representation to even be a little progressive is if it s backed up by an economic critique And the reason why Disney doesn t do this isn t because their afraid of inspiring people to start a revolution or something They don t do it because they make movies that are supposed to be entertaining and easy to follow for  year olds
Feminism,1615474682,I mean I m a man and I like children and want to be a father Not that you have to like the same things as me just cause you are a women but a life without doing all I can to educate and form the next generation to be as good as they can be   Sounds kinda sad to me

Feminism,1615472795,Yeah it s a not a perfect article  It tries to explain rape which in feminist theory is  correctly imo thought of as having to do with power and dehumanizing rather than any kind of desire It s heavily anecdotal it s not a     explanation But it does track with most of the consent incidents I ve had in the past year with men who sincerely liked me and cared for me but still pushed or crossed my boundaries

Feminism,1615469237,Hi your post has been because it s not a question and isn t really appropriate for this subreddit 
Feminism,1615469175,It results in bad treatment because then people don t give a shit how you feel what you want or if they hurt you They just do whatever to you and then act offended if you object Like if you go to a dance club and men just come up to you and start touching you and grinding on you without asking or even looking you in the face  they don t see you as a person they see you as a sexy piece of furniture that s there for their pleasure 
Feminism,1615469086,Yeah I think religions everywhere flourish on the suppression of women 
Feminism,1615469082,Yes but individuals aren t averages Should you only offer if you re actually stronger or larger than the woman you re asking That would actually be a reasonable stance but it doesn t have anything to do with being a woman I also think you can help simply through safety in numbers

Feminism,1615468601,   holy crap you re right I forgot all about that movie 
Feminism,1615468430,Ironically the successes of feminism often lead to anti feminist backlash which can make the road to equality much more incremental And speaking more generally progress is never a straight line anyway 
Feminism,1615468422,Some Christians find it distasteful to join a religion with the word  Satan in it though and I can respect that 
Feminism,1615497350,Can you expand a bit on what a  gain is  Because strictly speaking I m feeling more comfortable using a fem avatar therefor I m gaining something 
Feminism,1615497282,Thanks for your consideration for my comfort I m gonna be honest I don t understand my reasons either Hypothesis are myriads and I can t discriminate the valuable ones from the others I just empirically know what makes me feel more comfortable What I also know however is that I m comfortable enough being identified as male as to not seek to be identified as something else However you also made me realize that my post was poorly framed How do you feel about this situation in general  Let s say in MMOs for example provided that the avatar isn t unacceptable  gear looking consistent with the task tackled as reasonable body proportions as possible etc 
Feminism,1615497152,I m not sure I understand ti be quite honest and that may just be me not having a decent enough handle on the reality of this But to me its undeniable that women and men face different perils so it stands to reason that there is advice given specifically to women I do understand that there are certain aspects that are needlessly used against women  blaming clothing choices etc   but surely it s agreeable that in order to better equip people with the skills to stay safe it is integral to provide them with the most relevant advice according to their specific situation 
Feminism,1615496526,Nobody s talking about Sue Bird She s played   years and counting for my beloved Seattle Storm and is a sure bet to make the WNBA hall of fame 
Feminism,1615495607,Exactly my sentiment If somebody walks up to me and says  you are either of my opinion or you are wrong and evil i walk away laughing Unless I already hold their view I ll not be any more likely to consider it either There are SO MANY ideological movements that utilize exactly that rhethoric I pass Best way to gain allies is the tiresome long road I fully understand and empathize that many people have done that dozens of times and have grown tired of it Expecting the rest of the unconvinced world to just adapt your view without question because feel like you have arrived at the ultimate truth has historically been a hallmark of a lot of bad ideas so naturally people will probably not be convinced Has anyone here ever had a case where that approach worked anyway 
Feminism,1615495399,So long as you aren t using deception to gain something or hurt someone I don t see the harm 
Feminism,1615495221,Being apathetic and or inactive is favourable to the status quo Those who favour a status quo which in general is sexist are part of the problem Because your  in actions FAVOUR the systematic oppression of women This statement however doesn t apply to all cases equally A large subset of people are politically voiceless or inactive because of their position  usually at the bottom within society these people are not part of the problem and may be victims in various ways to the problem 
Feminism,1615495198,Objectification as we mean it is behavior or thought pattern that opens a door that allows sexual harassment among other things On it s own in a literal sense it is benign Much like the word  scientology implies it is the study of science but is actually the name of a cult like religion and requires critical thinking to fully understand why it s not just  science  study  objectification probably to you sounds like it is  just about treating someone like an object and we re all just objects But it means more than what it sounds like and also requires critical thinking to fully grasp Because we use it in a way that and this is a social norm that MOST people agree on that we are not using the word literally like we don t use the word scientology literally We are talking about it as someone denying our personhood because we are an object not a person instead of what you seem to think it means that we are an object AND a person 
Feminism,1615495132,That s not entirely true IMO I have had many exes guilt me into sexual acts havebyou considered the fact that men feel that they are  less of a man unless they are always ready for sex Making sweeping generalisations about all women is bad regardless of the context 
Feminism,1615494987,there is nothing wrong with giving people of all genders common sense safety advice but the special list of things given  specifically to women to avoid sexual violence is more often than not just used as a way to restrict their freedoms and as a cudgel to beat them over the head with if something does happen the list is endless and always changing when really the only thing victims have in common is bad luck 
Feminism,1615494586,I hate violence against woman but people shouldn t be expected to pick up a pitchfork and torch or else they are a target That is really scary to me 
Feminism,1615494353,I think people only have so much time in the day as well If actively asked are you against DV and educating people in relationships on how to conduct themselves I think most people would say yes    But if you ask people how much of their lives is activism you ll find a majority aren t actively activists I think most people are trying their best with the time they can allocate to help a cause And I think if pressed no one is against these causes  Its just you also have to live your life 
Feminism,1615494247,This exactly There is world of difference between someone who passively discusses these issues with friends and family but doesn t go to protests rallies and internet trolls that claim to be neutral but spout whataboutisms all day 
Feminism,1615493957,I don t know if I m comfortable or uncomfortable with it because I don t really understand your reason behind this I don t need you to explain it to me but it s something you should be absolutely clear about for yourself because it seems like a very important part of understanding yourself  But to properly answer your question As long as you don t do it for any creepy reasons I don t think I would be bothered I would literally only wonder  why   so that question will likely come at you a lot Also depends on the type of avatar of course but I m going with the assumption that it isn t anything freaky Maybe it would be helpful to have a better description of it but given the amount of concern you re voicing I d be highly surprised if it s something unacceptable 
Feminism,1615493759,As you said there are a lot of issues that warrant attention on top of what we need to do to earn money and stay mentally and physically capable to live Like most quotes and tweets it sounds nice in theory I have another one by a German rock band  It s not your fault that the world is like it is but it would be your fault if keeps like this  But in practice all our capacity for certain causes is limited Is it bad to devote only   minutes a day  h    of your income Should that better be spent on poverty reduction Or climate change Is it bad if I go to a climate demonstration but not on a women s march In the end those are only subjective things and there is no objective line between silence and action What we can do is be aware listen to victims and step in when violence or degrading language is used in our vicinity I would even go a step further and say the tweet is actively harmful the words have no objective meaning but they are intended both as a rallying cry for feminists and an insulting challenge for non feminists No one can tell me that it will convince a single person who is not yet a feminist to become one As such the tweet broadens the gap between groups instead of advocating for feminism 
Feminism,1615493601,This I know the injustice women face is bad and I will step in if I wittness people saying dumb sexist shit etc but my active social and political engagement is on different issues that I consider equally or more important to me and humanity in general or where I feel I can be more effective

Feminism,1615493109,For Roe I am everybody says it will be struck down but with a conservative SCOTUS I feel like they will let it slide so the GQP can create their version of Saud Arabia but I am on BC that stops my periods so I am not too worried but I wouldn t be surprised if they go after that next I am planning to save up money to move to New Zealand before the USA becomes Handmaid s Tale but even now that might not happen because they will probably try to take away a woman s right to work as well so I am pretty pessimistic about the future because I don t want children for mental health reasons and I probably would off myself if I did get pregnant and I don t want to do that so if anybody has any old school abortion tips please give them to me because while I am Aroace I know I could still possibly be raped Basically I am terrified as a young woman with a learning disability of what will happen if these Christo Fascists get their way so much that I don t trust anyone who aligns as conservative 
Feminism,1615493085,Yeah I mean I have no problem with the fact that conventionally unattractive people can t get on TV It s a visual medium that unfortunately just goes with the territory The issue I have is the sexism men and women should be roughly the same on average in terms of attractiveness  unless there is a very good narrative reason for this not being the case  
Feminism,1615493053,Got it I ll avoid it in the future This is my first day on this sub and I m used to arguing w nazis normally so I don t usually think abt it
Feminism,1615492780,I think Kali pretty much sums it up but I d also like to add that a very common excuse is misinformation or being simply unaware The thing about social issues is that you have to   choose  to be aware of them it s not so much that ignorance has and must be considered willful all the time but rather if we choose to give ignorance the power to excuse itself from being involved in social issues then literally NOTHING can be done because anyone can feign ignorance In other words someone ignorant to sexism might as well be complicit 
Feminism,1615492477,Well sure  everyone knows that violence against women is a problem What I meant was that people may not know the details  the extent to which it s a problem its pervasive presence in all forms of entertainment ways that they can get involved to reduce it etc Violence against women is so common in TV video games etc that a lot of people have just become accustomed to it They need to be educated and either or statements can be alienating to those people  My issue is only with the argument she used not with the cause itself 
Feminism,1615492167, gt a lot of people are simply ignorant about the extent and details of the issue At this point though you have to be  trying to be unaware of these kinds of things 
Feminism,1615492014,I have a fair amount of experience with healthcare both as a patient and a medical student The most helpful thing in my opinion is being very clear about your concerns and if a doctor doesn t take them seriously escalating  Making a list of issues is a good idea for any appointment If you go into it with a clear idea of what needs to be addressed it s harder for someone to brush you aside A good doctor will ask if you have any concerns that haven t been addressed but because many doctors are rushed it s something that gets skipped often Unfortunately the onus is often on the patient to bring up their concerns Another important thing to keep in mind is to not be afraid to get a second opinion or to complain about poor quality care Here in the UK hospitals have a patient advice and liaison service  PALS who you can talk to if you re dissatisfied with your care They can help advocate for you or help you file a formal complaint I ve spoken with them twice once after having appalling treatment by paramedics and another time when I wanted to file a complaint against my psychiatrist They are very helpful Another thing don t be afraid to change doctors Sometimes you won t have a good rapport with a given doctor It happens Changing doctors is okay They shouldn t take offense to it 
Feminism,1615491983,I don t like  either you re with us or against us statements generally It s extremely divisive and it doesn t invite curious inquiry It also ignores the fact that a lot of people are simply ignorant about the extent and details of the issue Being uninformed doesn t mean that you re maliciously refusing to take up Jamil s cause but that s what I hear her imply in her quoted statement I also find an element of self righteous gatekeeping in these types of statements too They just turn me off entirely 
Feminism,1615491691,Yeah idk maybe we mean the same thing here maybe we don t so I ll just explain what I ve seen from experience Maybe that helps    I don t really think  women as an entire demographic is the thing to focus on I am in a year with    female students Most of them being white and from rich backgrounds Those are not interested in changing the very thing that guaranteed them a spot And a lot of them have a strained relationship with feminism  at best  plenty are happy to support anti feminist views because   privilege  So   what would actually help a lot more than simply having any women at all is trying to remove barriers and have more BIPOC women more queer folks more folks with disabilities and so on The more diverse a student body is the more the curriculum will have to change to acknowledge different needs  hopefully  Because in the current environment privileged women thrive the same way men do and don t speak up to change things 
Feminism,1615490954,I think having women in medschool will change things But in my assumption I do not think women will be a passive presence therein Women will and must use their voice when in medschool and in medicine  I could have made that clearer 
Feminism,1615490833,If you truly care about ending violence you will care enough to try and prevent it from happening in the future not just prevent it from happening in front of you

Feminism,1615490661,I m sorry I m ESL And to me that initial thing sounded very much like  having women in medschool will change things  
Feminism,1615490576,I understand and agree with everything you are saying In the short term I said all you can do is refuse to go unheard   So I am not sure why you are reading me or into that as advocating for  just waiting   The demand to be heard is the basis for a lot of civil rights movments including feminist ones  But in this I do not dispute anything you are saying I am just confused by the way you are insisting on reading me 
Feminism,1615490420,I try to see female doctors wherever possible I find that they are generally more willing to explore any complaints I have to try and get to the bottom of them 
Feminism,1615490314,In my house we joke about it   Daughter comes out with short shorts on  Me How is that I have failed so badly as a mother that I have not instilled the appropriate amount of crippling body shame in you yet Kid laughs I laugh She knows where the lines are and how to manage them well enough She knows where the danger is Now I d only bring it up if she s going into a new environment  eg going to a concert where older drunk men will be  
Feminism,1615490270, gt doctors HAVE to treat you immediately when you re in pain They can t send you away ah that must be nice
Feminism,1615490124,Yes sexist doctors consider you to be dramatic But I m also loud and annoying and they can t just ignore the ruckus like they can a silent sufferer Several doctors told me that women tend to become really calm and focused in reality which is often interpreted as  not so serious  because men complain quite much in comparison It was one of them who told me to act up more I m still not very dramatic though  Where I live doctors HAVE to treat you immediately when you re in pain They can t send you away without relieve and I always remind myself of that 
Feminism,1615489875,A change over a few decades doesn t really solve anything tho Like sure I m glad in    y people will probably have better healthcare but   women right now are still being sent home on anxiety meds when they really have pneumonia or a heart attack  And the thing is women simply existing in a space really doesn t change a lot Especially when all the rules are still made by men and it s a huge boys club where you are told you should be grateful to have a seat at the table at all I am not saying change is impossible  I am currently working to strike stuff from the curriculum at my university  but women simply signing up doesn t do anything There would have to be a radical overhaul of curricula and teaching practices And I don t see that happening with most medschools leaning white rich and conservative where I am It s definitely not gonna happen by just   waiting Not with such high barriers to even get a spot  I d like to put it out there tho that I m literally doing feminist activism at a medical university btw My point isn t that change is impossible But it ll require an insane amount of work and basically rethinking any program that s currently taught in medschool Bc they all have plenty of bias 
Feminism,1615489736, This century So you got this Lifting the ban on women in combat        I d absolutely agree that s a good thing but it should also be a requirement to sign in for the draft hopefully we can get that done in the next   years Maintaining the existence of Planned Parenthood  ongoing I m personally a fan of aborting unborn children but let s not forget depending on the study it s pretty much    of people are pro and    against abortions so I wouldn t necessarily call that a big win  MeToo            I d say the meetoo movement hurt more people than helped wrong accusations and made up stories destroyed the legitimacy of real victims and it absolutely backfired it s less likely people will believe the victim of sexual assault today than it was back in      or    
Feminism,1615489402, gt pretending to be extra sick Doesn t this perpetuate the stereotype that women are being dramatic or exaggerating when they have a health complaint 
Feminism,1615489292,I am not sure you read long term correctly If you are suggesting that this status quo is inevitable and demographic shifts and new perspectives will in the long term amount to nothing   Well I disagree Over the last hundred years a lot has changed Over the next hundred years a lot more will and can change  How things are is not immutable and in the long term it will change And demographic shifts and the demand for recognition will continue to push things along None of this long term stuff requires women  in general to be immune to anything  Women fought against women getting the right to vote And the idea of women not voting was  hard in how people thought   Still it changed So your statement of how hard it is or will be doesn t mean on the long term things will not change 
Feminism,1615489173,I don t think it s bad to ask in general It s true that dangerous people would say all those things Which is a factor in why a woman might say no Obviously since you re asking this out of genuine concern Im gonna assume you re not dangerous But the person you re asking probably won t know that So If you re polite about it and she says  No thank you  Just wish her well and part ways
Feminism,1615489132,Yes you are part of the problem because social correction is essential to form a society If you don t step in you signal the perpetrators as well as the victims that what happens is justified and ok These things happen all the time and no one gets punished often to the contrary get cheered on because people who believe to be on right side shut up Women can t avoid it so you can t either 
Feminism,1615489119, gt you not mentioning men tells more about your opinion on feminism than the rest What does this mean Is your complaint that a movement for women s issues doesn t focus more on men 
Feminism,1615489002,I agree     on principle Where it gets hard for me is the vast amount of suffering in the world Domestic violence Poverty Failures of the education system Pollution Unaffordable healthcare Race and all the MANY ways it shows up strucutally Environmental degradation and climate change Transportation infrastructure equity issues Corruption erosion of democracy and solid journalism I could go on   I work really hard to be a good person but I couldn t possibly be deeply informed on all these issues take meaningful action on everything  It s not for lack of trying   Judging a whole person s character based on whether they take the exact steps you think they should is alienating of potential allies  If you know someone s heart is in the right place inviting them to join you  donate march volunteer speak up etc seems more effective to me Even if they only were meaningfully active in their local school board I wouldn t write them off To me any work towards their work greater good is the standard to meet 
Feminism,1615488839,That s the problem my mom is having right now She suspects that one of her symptoms is tied to something with her reproductive system and wanted to clear it with her doctor but the dude just won t listen She s trying to see a specialist now so it s good to know that someone else has had some success with doing their research beforehand 
Feminism,1615488704, you not mentioning men tells more about your opinion on feminism than the rest You wouldn t touch that guy with a stick  and you know that  You are making it way too easy with this  feminism can t be criticized by definition shtick

Feminism,1615488625,I have noticed that as well I do think that TV movies in the United States are getting better as far as that is concerned though as well as more actresses around middle age are showing up in major TV and movie roles 
Feminism,1615488586,Marital rape literally wasn t a crime until the    s The fact that feminism hasn t solved all the worlds issues yet doesn t mean it isn t a good thing 
Feminism,1615488469,I ve recently started to have more success in getting doctors to listen to me and it s a bunch of garbage bullshit that no one should have to do and I only have to do it because of patriarchy and fatphobia  BUT that being said I do have a couple things that I ve found really really helpful  amp  x   B For one I ve tried not to catch my doctors off guard about any of my questions  Especially when you re dealing with chronic conditions or weird symptoms it s impossible for the doctor to know off the top of their head what is causing it  And a lot of those things feasibly  could be caused by anxiety or stress or weight or whatever and if you catch them off guard with it saying it s probably one of those things significantly simplifies their job and it s really tempting to do So what I do is the day before any doctor s appointment I either use the online patient portal or the telephone to reach out to the office and say  Hey I m looking forward to my appointment with Dr So And So tomorrow  Can we put a note in my file to make sure to leave some time to talk about specific medical problem  It s really been concerning me lately   Then your doctor knows it s not just an offhand concern it s really bothering you and they ll be able to come in prepared with some more nuanced less under pressure thoughts for what it might be  amp  x   B Another thing that s been really helpful for me is to be completely     respectfully behind whatever my doctor thinks the problem is and be willing to take whatever actions they want me to take but to make sure that I continue asking follow up questions to be sure that my problem won t be swept under the rug So you say things like  OK I ll definitely try to lose some weight to help my knee get better  Are there any signs I should look out for that indicate that it s getting worse or might be caused by something else  Do you think it would be beneficial for me to see a nutritionist to aid in weight loss  At what weight would you be concerned that my knee had some kind of problem other than weight  If it s still like this after  months should I check back with you  Give the impression that you re     down with the plan of  try your idea first   But make sure that that s being treated as a testable hypothesis with a specific instruction for  Do X  If it doesn t work in the next  months call me and we ll try something else   amp  x   B And if your doctor does even the bare minimum of listing to you and addressing your concerns without shuffling you out of the room go on google and write them a GLOWING review where you specifically mention how well they listen to your concerns when so many doctors don t listen to women  They will listen to you   times harder next time 
Feminism,1615488207,Sadly having more female students doesn t help Our education is racist and sexist and you ll find less women the  higher you go up the hierarchy So those who dictate treatment guidelines for hospitals and influence how patients are treated on an individual basis will probably be overwhelmingly male for a while regardless of student populations  Female doctors and medstudents aren t immune to bias Not even bias against their own gender And medschool drives those points home  hard  
Feminism,1615488182,Don t tell demonstrate A  neutral conversation allows doctors to ignore you acting it a little out makes them compassionate It sounds silly but I got the best results by pretending to be extra sick and complaining like my life depends on it 
Feminism,1615487993,I ll go with German writer Erich K stner on this one  All mischief that happens isn t only the fault of those who do it but also the fault of those who do not prevent it  Preventing it can look like actively stepping in But it can also be just educating others and being vocal about opposing something If you stand by while people are experiencing violence it doesn t phase you enough to care So yes if you ask me staying silent is condoning it Where exactly I d draw the line of  doing enough I can t say But if you do nothing at all you re complicit 
Feminism,1615487699,You seem to be very confused about what feminism is and what it s saying in the first place 
Feminism,1615487547, If you are neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppressor If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality  
Feminism,1615487406,In this  century  Okay The right to vote       The pill        the right for married women to obtain contraception        and the right for unmarried women to obtain contraception       The Violence Against Women Act       Marital rape declared a crime       Title VII which bans employment discrimination based on sex       Title IX       Roe v Wade       Lifting the ban on women in combat       Maintaining the existence of Planned Parenthood  ongoing Bringing attention to  date rape            MeToo            those are pretty major wouldn t you say 
Feminism,1615487371,Are you referring to women who have encountered problems related to how others have treated them based on their bodies or gender 
Feminism,1615486792,Give me ONE think in this century in let s say America
Feminism,1615486562, femminists by definition cannot be misandrists yeah there are jokes about being misandrists that some feminists make  I even know a man  w a  misandry now t shirt but by definition feminists cannot be misandrists And TERFs aren t real feminists either Feminism is for all women and trans women are women and are born  mentally as women TERFs also tend to be racist and antisemitic too so again they cannot be feminists either 
Feminism,1615486238,I wont deny that in the current day too much activism consists of sensationalism and virtue signaling This goes for all groups There are some flaws in the modern feminist movement sure Though at the end of the day you can t deny feminism has done exponentially  more good for the world than MRA s ever had 
Feminism,1615486173,I watch them with fascination I only know a few And even years later I m flabbergasted when they pull out a vacuum or know who the pediatrician is They re like goddamned unicorns 
Feminism,1615485836,I disagree but that s not that important the point is   current feminist groups are pretty terrible          blaming the patriarchy for their problems instead of solving anything  see what I did there  
Feminism,1615485116,You said nobody hates feminism but most people like equality and now you re saying there s a lot to hate about feminism and that s why they re having such a hard time achieving their goals Which is it 
Feminism,1615484921,And that s why feminism has such a hard time achieving equality that s the point   bud
Feminism,1615484680,After some bad experiences what I have done is I make a list of concerns questions before I go in  particularly if I m seeing a new doctor   and I m very annoying about not leaving until I get them all answered The other thing I do  which I know doctors hate but I have had too many just straight up blow me off  is do a little bit of research re the diagnostic testing needed for what I suspect might be the issue I then tell the doctor about my symptoms and if they don t recommend following the diagnostic protocol I ask them too If a doctor refuses to take me seriously after that I change doctors I have had problems with both women and men doctors  typically though you ll have better luck being listened too at a smaller practice rather than someone operating out of a large hospital and with a DO rather than an MD  Other than that  just be prepared emotionally and psychologically to be persistent 
Feminism,1615484621,Current MRA groups are pretty terrible That s not to say their can t be effective men s rights groups but most of the current ones seem more intent on blaming feminists for their problems instead of solving anything I would say that in order to achieve full equality both men and women need to break free from the current coerced hierarchy related to sex but I don t think MRA s will play any meaningful role in that

Feminism,1615484019,Can t argue that I m sure people like that exist it s just there s a difference between the movement and it s representatives   Like you d agree that a terf isn t exactly who you d want to be associated with  For someone looking at the movement from the outside   how should they know not everyone is the same  there s a lot to hate about feminism just like other groups like mgtow or MRA or whatever 
Feminism,1615483728,So is it bad to ask in general I was told this by another person in the comments  Dangerous people would also say all those things so that doesn t really help But when you offer to walk her home it s nice to make clear somehow that her refusing is an option and not a big deal to you like um  Hey it s late do you want me to walk you home If you prefer to go by yourself that s fine too     Does that work here under the advice you have given me Or is it better not to ask if they simply didn t ask me themselves

Feminism,1615482136,That s absolutely the point I tried to make thank you for wording it better  English is not my first language 
Feminism,1615480960,When I was in my   s I    f realized that men were probably more likely to be involved in a violent incident at night  But I was repeatedly told to  not go out alone   All the time  By a wide range of people It pissed me off  It felt like society was using some sort of mystery boogey man to control me and keep me docile and at home  When the truth is my greatest risk of sexual assault is from men I have some sort of relationship with So I started going out alone  Walking around town late at night  Traveling Hiking You name it if I want to do it I will do am honest risk assessment and go do it    I am aware that there are risks to solo activities and sometimes the reward is not worth the risk After   years and multiple cities in North America and Europe  stranger put his arm around me another  masturbated in front of me  But guys I know have committed sexual assault sexual coercion unwanted physical contact   various things  at the end I feel safer among strangers out in the open where I can separate myself than in an enclosed space with casual acquaintances 
Feminism,1615480671,Ever been mugged Because I have twice The second time they didn t even ask for anything They just knocked me down and beat the living shit out of me before even trying to take anything I was off work for two months Know what literally everyone  the cops the doctors my friends my family my wife  said to me constantly  What were you thinking walking alone that late How drunk were you Well what did you  expect   The idea that no one blames men for their own victimization is a complete myth The experience is absolutely not unique to women 
Feminism,1615480643,I think it s important to remember that victims of violent crimes that were reported to the police of both genders are a very small minority of the population  It s a very small number of people who are like  this happened to me or I saw it happened to someone else and now I am scared   That s not the primary driver for feelings of safety or lack of safety The primary driver for people s feelings of lack of safety are their actual experiences  And I think that women are overwhelmingly more likely than men to encounter non violent threats outside the home unrelated to their own behavior  If someone catcalls you if someone follows you home but doesn t actually hurt you if someone whispers something sexual in your ear on a train often even if you re groped in passing  Those things almost never get reported to police and especially they don t count as  violent crimes   And most women have had an experience with something like that in places that most people would consider  safe   They ve had a male stranger follow them or make uncomfortable advances towards them in a coffee shop on a crowded train in a well lit bar in the supermarket at the gym walking down a busy main road in broad daylight  These smaller scary ways that men victimize women happen in places that are supposed to be safe and they happen to almost all women at some point in their lives In my experience men and women both feel fear when parking in a dark alleyway far from the bar when walking alone in the woods when passing a shady looking character on the street  But I think that women more than men are frequently reminded that even places that are normal and safe can be very dangerous to women  That guy who followed you in the mall could follow you into the parking garage and murder you and even if he didn t you always know that he could have  amp  x   B Also a nonzero percentage of the male number can be attributed to perpetrators of violence being more likely to be victims of violence and a majority of perpetrators of violence are male  So like if  dudes start fighting eachother in a bar with no women in it that s  men who are victims of a violent assault  I think in general non perpetrator men are still more at risk for violence outside the home but it does inflate those numbers a little 
Feminism,1615480622,Men can put up a fight this gives us a lot of peace of mind But being a woman at the mercy of half the population which by and large lusts for you Wouldn t you be scared 
Feminism,1615480389, gt Okay so it s not inherently sexist to want to It s not inherently but it  can be sexist  It ultimately depends on  why you want to and how equal you are in your desire to help women who may benefit from your help vs other people that may need your help 
Feminism,1615479955,Most muggings occur at night and fewer women are out at night in the first place 
Feminism,1615479927,Your stats is flawed As other comment pointed out women are more likely to not go outside at all in fear of being assaulted Also men participate in violence at greater numbers than women so consequently they suffer more from this violence  You should compare pure numbers of men and women going outside and how they are assaulted and harassed Funny how you didn t include the latter in your stats because even if women aren t assaulted they are catcalled and creeped on by men which is intimidating already A threat of assault is always there even if it doesn t necessarily result in assault 
Feminism,1615508629,It is a great quote but I don t think it applies as well to those who are in charge of selection of candidates as well as it does to the voting by the general populace If those selecting candidates don t try to find someone a bit better than the best old white guy from a stack of mostly old white guys things are not going to improve They bear more responsibility for the candidates 
Feminism,1615507735,But you assumed I wasn t a feminist by asking that question and saying that You see that right 
Feminism,1615507591,Did you know that there s been an epidemic in the United States of Native American women going missing or becoming victims of homicide In     alone over      Indigenous women went missing   How many of their names  stories do you know  How many of those women even made it to the local news let alone the national news 
Feminism,1615507229,I do think media in general focus more on white people And white women s tears are really alluring to the media like a moth to a flame  However I think this case in particular seems to be one of those where the circumstances or even just the timing is propitious to become viral I ll be more than happy to see the tweets you saw to read what POC s think about this particular case  I myself do not think I m a white woman per se however  I don t think I have a say on women of color s opinions It s difficult for me to know my  place  
Feminism,1615507036,Every person regardless of gender has a moral obligation to intervene when they see injustice occurring I m not a man I m physically fairly weak and I m someone who has their share of trauma around issues of violence I ve also intervened in a number of situations where my physical safety was at risk in doing so because intervening could help prevent someone from being seriously injured I do not think this behavior is exceptional or that it s unreasonable to expect people to intervene Just as many high schools require CPR public education should cover bystander intervention 
Feminism,1615506754,You didn t ask anyone else this question but you asked me Fine I ll assume you were just genuinely asking    How old are you And it seems you re very keen to insult me anyways As if you re looking for an excuse Be my guest It s unproductive but it s a free country insult me if you want I m not gonna be a baby about it

Feminism,1615505741,That s not what I said   It has nothing to do with your gender it has to do with your understanding of feminism Keep arguing with me though 
Feminism,1615505410,I don t think the majority of men who are  neutral have much interest in feminism especially if they have never looked into it There s plenty of feminist who talk about the ways it helps men Do you think white people are put off dealing with racism by the protests at some point to get real change there s going to be uncomfortable things that happen and uncomfortable discussions What if talking about male privilege puts them off can we not have those discussions then It sounds like the same attitude given to gay people who wanted marriage  don t ask for too much it s not the right time to treat you guys as equal yet it s never the right time Progress usually comes with backlash  Women get angry over our lifetime of oppression but I ve only seen the  everyday is men s day in response to men s sarcastic response to women s day Those kinds of men aren t interest in being nice or converting to feminism 
Feminism,1615504794,You sound like you care about being a good person and a good friend  I don t know if you can help your friends but you can help yourself  A counselor can help give you tools to reduce remove intrusive thoughts  ones you don t want and negative thoughts  I didn t want to go too far and say low self esteem but a few things you said made me wonder   And for the record that teacher IS a jerk It doesn t help anyone to put people down 
Feminism,1615504389,Here s my problems with it   She s wrong that Disney didn t show things like the monarchy being overthrown in Aladdin and Dumbo being remade to be about how racism is evil because they are afraid of people turning against oppressive systems that they benifit from The reason why they did this is because they are adapting pre existing stories and adding these things would not have made sense within the context of the story whatsoever    Why can t a fantasy world in which good capitalists or good rich people exist They don t exist in the real world but this isn t the real world   She seems to be less bothered by this stuff in the originals due to nostalgia   She s wrong that representation in itself isn t progressive

Feminism,1615501561,I disagree with the text you quoted If you are an oppressed minority other than a woman your first priority is to your own struggle cause As long as you are being oppressed you owe other oppressed groups nothing Your strength and energy should rightly go to your own struggle first and foremost It is either a case of white privilege cis oppression or ableism if other groups demand to siphon off your energy to their own cause while you are struggling with your own discrimination and abuse This seems like the idea of some privileged white feminists who want to coop the energy of other oppressed minorities and flip it over to feminist cause I find it a really sketchy and underhanded tactic 
Feminism,1615501343, gt Because feminist have equated femininty with being weak and conforming to the standards men set for women  Wearing a dress heals and makeup is seen as catering to men  This is not accurate 
Feminism,1615501106,You are correct Women are thought they should be on tv because of how pretty they are That is first Acting ability comes second And there are so many guys on tv that if you met them on the street you would never look at them twice much less want them to look at you Vince Vaughn comes to mind Not exactly attractive overweight looks like your typical loser dude on the sofa and he doesn t even act that well Everything I ve seen him in is just about the same char But they pair him up with Jennifer Aniston who can act has a slim body and is gorgeous He should be paired up with Rosanne  people on the same attractiveness side not ugly but not Jennifer Aniston   But there are a lot of those pairings It s also harder to relate to women onscreen if somewhere in the back of your mind your thinking they are perfect it makes it a little harder to sympathize One of my favorite shows is on BBC The Split Nicola Walker plays a lawyer She is brilliant I always feel lucky to be able to watch it with her because she  would never be allowed on us tv She doesn t look like a supermodel and she make me  think of how many other actresses that would make a show a standout because of their acting ability  but aren t allowed because their attractiveness level is only that of Vaughn To be honest I think she is more attractive than him but she would never be on US tv 
Feminism,1615501069,Women generally have other outlets for sexual frustration like cats and sex toys men utilize sex in a different way and there s really no good substitute for a woman wanting you intimately Further more the average women can have sex anytime with somebody My ex had  guys lined up the day we broke up Im still single decades later
Feminism,1615500795,I understand where the confusion comes from especially because blanket statements like  if you re not with us by definition you re against us are not very open minded I think what she means though is if as a man you talk about how women deserve rights but when women accuse others of rape assault when they march for rights if no men step up to speak in support they re not really doing much They can say all they want about women s rights but how many men have stepped up in support of Evan Rachel Wood of Rose McGowan of all the women who scream that they ve suffered violence It s always the women The men stand back like they re just letting women do their thing But they have to raise their voice too Call out men who abuse You don t need to witness it to interrupt the violence Simply believe women fervently and use your privileged cishetero platform to call out the violence and demand justice Like male celebs need to be at MeToo marches and events at TimesUp events If Charisma comes out to denounce the monster Whedon David Boreanaz and Nicholas Brendon need to do more than say oh that s so sad I m sorry They should demand they deplatform Whedon Brendon s oh he s my friend is bullshit Help women fight the violence or admit you re just pretending to believe women They can t have their cake and eat it too Men are so bro ey in that They respect other men so hard that they can t respect women more and support them           and yell it from the rooftops The time has come and gone for women to be apologetic of men as bystanders They either do it or they don t Notice how quick women are to defend and believe women they ve never met Men don t do that They only give their two cents when it s a friend If that I wanna hear Hugh Jackman Martin Scorsese Chris Pine I want all these men with large platforms to come out and say I believe her and I support her They have nothing to lose They re men The most privileged bunch But they don t It becomes a oh no comment I don t know the story The same turning of heads when they see a drunk guy at a bar force himself on a woman or yell at his girlfriend It s like there s a written code to be loyal to each other It s stupid and we shouldn t let these men just get away with it 
Feminism,1615500788,Oh you re spot on with that They aren t inherently safer it s more like an admittedly biased brain filtering mechanism You filter people based on trustworthiness and a man playing as a woman automatically gets a  deception point added to his list even if it s obvious that he is a man But I personally feel much safer around women so not everyone will weigh the same to that point as I do And of course personal experiences See the reason I said I realized I feel safer watching a stream is that I would feel like I would get a better glimpse into the person playing and by that find safety in knowing the person s motivations to the degree that is perceivable over it in the first place Commentary adds a lot to that  That being said it would be really great to see someone break through all this negativity Show them how it s done without toxic masculinity 
Feminism,1615500738,They aren t I had women get violent with me when I refuse them   Which is weird because women can get it somewhere else fairly easy I had several women force themselves on me and wouldn t take no for an answer My first time I was drunk and practically  passed out and the woman forced herself on me One diffrence with guys is we don t make a deal out of it since it doesn t effect us emotionally and its not painful but I mean I was way to out of it to consent and honestly didn t want to Technically it was rape I didn t realize that untill years later It doesn t bother me just kinda wish my first time wasn t with some rando from a bar and a nite I barely remember 
Feminism,1615500678,Not sure if you replied to the wrong comment but the show I was referring to is Call my Agent not Big Bang Theory I m kind of in the middle with BBT I thought it was hilarious when it came out but I definitely see that it s problematic and agree with the criticisms 
Feminism,1615500677,The actual existence of physical violence is the highest escalation provising the biggest impulse to intervene If someone is afraid to intervene someone grabbing a girl s ass because he might end in the hospital do you think he would be more willing to risk his physical wellbeing if the women  just got catcalled I don t think that s a fair argument on your end to make Also as I explained people may have different resources Sure if you can afford to help someone in distress you should     do it But for many people it may not be an option Is it lack of character that a     guy doesn t want to intervene catcalling from a group of drunk and possibly aggressive guys Wh should he be risking his physical health for a stranger Where does this obligation come from He can call the police and that s all you should expect from him Do you think otherwise And if so why is that If you would go to hospital or lose your job to help someone you maybe don t even know you are a better human than most people 
Feminism,1615500536,Ahah well full disclosure here When I was like    playing Guild Wars   my dad asked me why I was playing as a woman with a smug expression on his face That s pretty much what I answered him and had been answering since until some years ago when I got educated and educated myself further on feminism and started deconstructing dumb toxic shit Seems like we re going full circle On the other hand tho I m afraid they might have a point Maybe the experienced comfort is just gratification in misogynistic objectification and visual stimuli That s an hypothesis I m fairly afraid of I wouldn t like myself very much in that case 
Feminism,1615500504,Yeah maybe I just like being stereotypically feminine They are ultimately just social constructs 
Feminism,1615500426,I disagree I think most rapist just have zero self  control and want sex 
Feminism,1615500367,There is nothing wrong with teaching our young people risk mitigation strategies and situational awareness What  women have been objecting to is different  Women are given advice that a assumes we don t already know and practice these strategies and b asks us to go beyond these strategies in ways that unreasonably restricts our ability to participate in public life It is also advice that is not given to men  We should remember that many women  especially if they are poor can t avoid going out alone even if we wanted to or would have to make extraordinary sacrifices to do so  Let s also remember that given women are actually at higher risk from men known to them the commonly suggested strategy of  ask a male friend to walk you home is probably more dangerous than walking home alone 
Feminism,1615500336,If a guy wants to be more feminine in appearance thats fine if thats what you want 
Feminism,1615500247,Because feminist have equated femininty with being weak and conforming to the standards men set for women Wearing a dress heals and makeup is seen as catering to men The truth is there s nothing wrong or weak about being feminine if you want to be and yes dressing a certain way is feminine You can be an intelligent ambitious woman and feminine

Feminism,1615499913,How do you actively end violence other than not participating or condoning it I don t see how society as a whole will end violence The world is violent in genera I even read a study that claimed the human body is designed for violence Violence is caused by so many factors its virtually impossible to end That would also mean ending mental illness and basic human nature in fact nature is violent even plants are violent We can preach don t hit women until our throats bleed but that won t stop every psychopath from doing it Furthermore violence can be circumstantial a perfectly nice guy and general may strike a woman in a blind rage or because he s drunk In the western world violence in general against anyone is shunned but it still happens and will probably always happen as sure as water is wet This same theory applies to  teach men not to rape Every man knows he shouldn t  rape no one needs to be taught that Things that you don t want done to you people know they shouldn t do to others But some people don t care 
Feminism,1615499720,It s alright I ll be playing too obvi the question still applies I should also add that I don t plan on talking or showing my face on stream but my gender and preferred pronouns will definitely be on the Twitch bio page  gt I generally avoid men playing as women because they tend to be creepy or exploitive often both  So it s more of a correlation than a causality relationship  Like no inherent problem with using a fem avatar as a cis male In this case and at the risk of saying something unsafe isn t it just that MMO culture is stifled with toxic masculinity and creepy dudes while most people are using fem avatars anyway  Or are men using masc avatars generally less toxic and safer  
Feminism,1615499665,Are you qualified to teach adult women how to protect themselves Do you not think we already know how The outrage over the Sarah Everard situation is that she did everything right She did all she could to protect herself and was still murdered It isn t that no women should do what they can to avoid danger it s that most women already do what they can and are still killed The issue is women have and are still being made to change what they do to accomodate for the actions of murderers and rapists Like when the yorkshire ripper was about and women were put under a curfew Would it not have made more sense to put men under a curfew since then any men out and about could be classed as suspects Obvious y it s not an identical situation but you get my point  Women do and will continue to do everything they can to protect themselves and nothing you say will change that Instead do us a favour and make sure other men in your life arent harrassing raping or murdering women 
Feminism,1615499582,It seems to me too impractical If we lived in some utopian society where discrimination or violence are are few and far between having an active position against every instances of marginalisation would be in everyone s physical or mental capacity but our world is far too cruel to allow that  Everyday we are passing through constant stream of news that never stop to report about injustices around the world Every case is deserving full public attention but not everyone has ability or time to provide it It is inevitable that there would be a need to prioritize some events over others and I don t know any other method to do so other than leaving it on our own personnel choice Nobody should decide for anyone what problems in society are more important  if you agree with all of that  you must also consider that there would be people who would who while not supporting current state of affairs still not do anything about it Edit misspelled
Feminism,1615499439,I wonder in which way you should expect men individually to step in on such occasions I hope we can have a meaningful discussion on this so let me elaborate Let me first start by the premise of abolishing toxic gender roles One of which would be the male as the strong protector of the weak female Women are strong and need no men to protect them So there is no obligation to stop violence because they are men On the other hand men might also face consequences if they intervene in certain violent situations These consequences may be social or physical Which highly depends on the social area the violence is happening For example A man has a job he needs for his survival He sees his boss molest one of his female colleagues And while the colleague is afraid to stop her boss because she might lose her job you could say the same about the man bearing witness to the horrible behavior A man in the Disco watching someone grab a women s butt This is obviously and clearly sexual violence While the women might be afraid to defend herself due to clear physical threat the man witnessing can feel the same way Intervention might lead to himself ending up in the hospital for someone he doesn t even know In conclusion in certain situation men might not have the resources to actively intervene a violent situation May it be financially socially or physically Expecting those men to risk their health financial stability or social standing in some cases for someone they don t know may be a lot to ask This said if you have the resources to intervene a case of violence you should obviously do it No matter the attacker or victim of this violence But I think it s important to have a bit of nuance here 
Feminism,1615499203,This is not a bad unwelcome comment but we do have a  top level rule   here that requires all users replying directly to posts to be feminists I am not sure that is the case with you so I d ask that you relegate your participation to nested comments 
Feminism,1615499171,My concern with this type of sentiment is that some people will judge your efforts not to be enough or not matching their efforts and therefore you fall in with the oppressor I ve learned it takes all kinds and different people have different strengths The writer may not be an eloquent public speaker The person who works behind the scenes may not be comfortable protesting in a crowd The person that trys to educate on an individual basis because they connect better that way may not have things posted on social media And the movement leader from a year ago may now be battling cancer and no longer has the energy to devote to a cause  If we can take our personal judgements out of the equation and instead open the door for all types of support we may see a larger group It also gives some people an opportunity to learn other ways of support

Feminism,1615498927,I want to clarify that this was more from the perspective of someone who would encounter you in game so it s kind of a brainfart given that you re talking from a streamer perspective So I think you could eliminate those doubts easily along the line It makes me realize I would feel more comfortable watching this scenario in a stream than being a playing participant So from a player perspective I generally avoid men playing as women because they tend to be creepy or exploitive often both Apologies for the confusion haha

Feminism,1615498844,Quite often telling women to be more careful is presented as the solution instead of other societal solutions that would be far more intricate and complicated to enact For instance if a politician gets airtime to talk about an attack that happened in their city I want them to use that airtime to talk about how they will fix the societal underlying problems Not to say  We advise all women to stay home at night  I don t need a politician to tell me that I know that I do need a politician to fix my city s problems

Feminism,1615498466, gt I know I ve went a little off topic so I hope it s still within this subreddit s scope but would you say that my neutrality has made me complicit in anti Asian racism and other social justice movements that I haven t engaged as much in Are you taking a position of neutrality on this issue though Is it your position that you don t have an opinion  you don t feel one way or the other about it  and if you were confronted by someone who did have a racist opinion about Asian s and COVID would you agree with them to avoid conflict What would your response be to someone impacted by the issue directly asking for your help Would you decline and say  I don t have an opinion and I prefer to be neutral  Because that s different than having an opinion but not having had an occasion to become involved in an effort for advocacy I think what s also okay and different  is prioritizing issues on the basis of your capacity to engage and be meaningfully knowledgeable and supportive  not everyone can be involved in every issue I have tended to prioritize feminism  because I m a woman and anti racism  because I m a white person living in a majority black city   other issues I am active in have a priority order after those two based on my limited human ability to think and feel and be fully present  and that kind of prioritization isn t what Jamil or others who use this kind of language is talking about Burning yourself out trying to give equal air time and attention to every group and issue in the world is impossible  no one involved in activism for the long haul has that expectation of themselves or others

Feminism,1615498317,I am a female physician working in the ER I think something we as physicians aren t always good at is reconciling patient priorities with our priorities I have a few things to recommend to patients to help reframe the  we are a team approach to their own symptoms Spoiler alert  the final step is to find a new GP if you still aren t feeling listened to  First off book an appointment to specifically address the symptoms that aren t being attended to Don t try to tag them onto an appointment about your other health issues The latter may result in you being blown off as time often limits most GP appointments to ten minutes If your GP is really focused on your heart health they may not have time to address say more chronic symptoms such as fatigue or pain or weight loss etc  Be upfront with specific concerns in that appointment don t leave them to the end Usually we open with an open question like  what brings you in today  Reply with something like  I was hoping to ask some questions related to my  lt symptom gt  as I feel as though I don t fully understand my management plan for it   If you have something in particular you are worried about be upfront about that too  Doctor I keep getting frightened that this pain may be cancer Is that something you are concerned about too or have we ruled that out already  If we haven t ruled that out  Would we be able to do some tests for that for peace of mind or can you explain to me why that isn t on your list of possibilities  The answer to  can I get more tests may still be  no depending on what your concern or question is For example if you are requesting full body MRI to rule out every possible cause of cancer that isn t a feasible workup But if you re having pelvic pain or bleeding  I saw in your comment the concern was the reproductive system  and wonder if there could be a problem there a pelvic ultrasound or endometrial biopsy is a reasonable and easy thing to arrange for  As someone else suggested if your management plan still seems like you re being blown off you have a few options First you can say something like  okay so the best step now is to give it some more time to see if it settles It has already been a problem for  lt days weeks months whatever gt  When should I come back in if it fails to settle down to go forward with the next step What is the next step  You can also ask for a referral  If it doesn t settle down would I be able to discuss this further with a specialist If there s a long waitlist could we put that referral in today so the follow up is in place  If all else fails  Would I be able to talk about this with one of the other Doctors in your practice to get a second opinion I m really worried about it  And finally you can  fire your doctor and call around for a new one if you re still being blown off  I don t recommend exaggerating your symptoms as someone else here commented If symptoms are exaggerated  so a chronic symptom is being stated as severe or more acute or in a larger distribution  it can change the differential diagnosis So you may end up with a work up that is inappropriate for your presenting complaint  Honesty is the best policy Sometimes it does take several visits and a step wise approach to get a diagnosis and this is normal and reasonable  Consider attending the appointment with your mom if she is having trouble explaining these things or isn t being listened to If all else fails find a new provider Attending medical school doesn t make us all good people or infallible and sometimes you just have a bad egg as a PCP

Feminism,1615545032, gt It seems like feminists can understand this concept when they tell men to do their own advocacy on men s issues instead of asking them to do it  Here s the thing though the majority of violent crimes are committed by men against both men and women It seems to me that part of the problem is that men often don t do anything to help each other either One of the main things that gets repeated over and over is that we need to teach boys how to properly handle their actions and emotions and take some personal responsibility rather than expecting other people to change their behavior This would not only help reduce violence against women but it would help reduce violence in general

Feminism,1615532992,I agree with what you re saying I think a scary thought is that perhaps a big reason why public violence is so low for women is because they re not in public and not in the way of opportunistic violence as much as men are 
Feminism,1615532563,I do think there are good points made here and many elements of modern culture that teach women and girls that they should be afraid to exist publicly in the world but tolerant of and obedient to authority figures and family members  are rooted in sexist traditions often with a splash of racism and victim blaming for good measure  That said I d be hesitaant come to the conclusion that it s  all an overblown phenomenon For instance there are plenty of ways women can be made to feel uniquely uncomfortable alone in public spaces that might fall short of actually constituting violent crime but still contribute to a general feeling of hostility or danger that can leave a lasting impression  Also not all crime is necessarily cut from the same cloth even if men are more likely than women to be the victims of violent crime in general women could still be more likely to be the victim of  gendered violence   that is crime committed not out of opportunism but specifically on the basis of the victim s sex with rape and sexual assault being some obvious examples That kind of disproportionality can  rightly make a person feel less safe even if the absolute numbers are still lower

Feminism,1615512804,I m finding a lot of these comments frustrating to read She s not calling for people to step in the middle of a fistfight or devote their weekends to marches Sometimes it s as simple as saying  bro not cool when your friend makes a poor taste joke comment about women or making the choice to believe a woman when she comes forward about sexual abuse You don t have to shout it from the rooftops but just maintain that position when challenged on it by people who are choosing to take a more damaging view It can be hard to do those things and I definitely don t think you should do anything to jeopardise your safety but if you re not making the choice to face those things then you re not contributing to making the world a better place for marginalised people

Feminism,1615510438,No man reaches a point of committing rape by saying  I wanna do this and I don t care how it affects the woman  They reach that point by finding a million signals of approval from the world around them A million little things that convince them that   consent isn t really so important    women  love playing hard to get    women don t know  what they want       Shades of Grey is what women are  really looking for   a man s worth is measured by the number of sexual conquests he has regardless of the circumstances    she was flirting at the bar so even though she s passed out that doesn t mean no   all women love rough stuff even if they don t admit it    THESE  are the things that we must fight against These are the messages we men must rise to violently oppose Otherwise yes  we are complicit in the violence

Feminism,1615557612,I think this is generally there so that women can feel more comfortable In many gyms men will just stare at women s bodies or harass them even though the women are just minding their business and working out This can leave women feeling bad and very self conscious   gt Do you think this is exclusionary to trans people  No if they allow trans women too in those slots If they don t it s trans exclusive That would depend on the gym   gt Should men also get an hour  Not necessary since there aren t many women who explicitly stare at or harass men It s not a systemic problem that few men may get harassed   gt Should other groups e g races LGBT etc also get their own time slots  This solves an issue specific to gender So race LGBTQ people etc don t have to get another separate slot If they too faced issues in gym because of belonging to a certain race or orientation there should be separate slots But since that s not the case it s not necessary 
Feminism,1615557593,How I feel about this I m deeply sad that it s necessary but so appreciate the option Like many women I ve been harassed at the gym by men A lot As a result I m not very comfortable working out around men I m glad I have an option for working out that allows me to avoid this situation altogether The entire issue could be better mitigated if gyms would just protect their clientele from harassment but they generally choose not to do so And honestly a man simply staring and watching my every move ruins my workouts because it s creepy and weird AF but no normal gym will kick them out for it  I visit less traditional workout venues now that are usually owned and operated by women or queer people or POC When that shit is clearly and openly unacceptable it doesn t really happen I like being able to fit a safe and comfortable workout into my schedule instead of building my whole schedule around the one hour I can have a safe and comfortable workout To answer your questions   Not necessarily especially since trans women are included and are typically the group most likely to experience violence or harassment  Also trans men were invited to participate in the women s hour at my old gym which is a great option for another group that may experience violence in that setting     No because cis men don t experience violence or harassment in gym settings related to their gender identity    Not necessarily because there isn t really a universal experience of harassment or violence based on race that is specific to a gym setting LGBTQ people

Feminism,1615555605,Disclaimer I don t know anything about this story except for what you ve posted here Let s start by looking at what we can uncontroversially agree on Lorenz made an inaccurate statement and was called out on it Then in response she said  gt  Thanks for clarifying      I hope you can understand how some people in the room felt hearing it I ll be honest initially I read this unsympathetically But then I stopped to think about what an  ideal response would be Maybe you have a better one but all I could think of is  Maybe she could say  I m sorry   That s expecting a  personal   emotional intervention from a woman that we likely wouldn t expect from a male reporter Because to me her response seems par for the course in terms of journalistic editing conventions In the context of an article usually it will just say something like  Update An earlier version of this article erroneously claimed that John Doe murdered ten thousand people John Doe is a surgeon who saved ten thousand people in tiny print at the bottom She said that someone used the r word when they didn t then acknowledged and thanked the person who corrected her So I d be interested in hearing how you would frame an ideal correction here in light of existing journalistic conventions You mentioned Jim Acosta how would he handle this But let s assume for a minute that she got it unequivocally wrong and that we agree that her response not only could have been better but was actively dodging responsibility Even so that there was a prolonged harassment campaign in response to this honestly has Sarkeesian gamergate vibes The claim of this campaign is ostensibly  accountability  Look I ve facilitated accountability processes before Trust me when I say that harassment is not conducive to self accountability  Sometimes self accountability isn t the goal but if self accountability is the goal harassment is not an effective tactic  This is because when a person is harassed they often adopt self protective measures This can look like over apologizing or over responsibilizing   I m so so incredibly sorry   please forgive me I m so sorry really I am  or it can look like complete denial of any responsibility because you re aware that the attacks on you are unfair  even if the criticisms are not  Actual self accountability is only possible when you have the room to stop breathe and think through what happened analyzing what caused it This is not an option when you are the target of a harassment campaign It s not wrong to  want someone to own up to having messed up but if you  expect that of someone who is subject of a harassment campaign you re going to be disappointed  gt does anybody else view her support for ending the harassment of women online as primarily a means to absolve her of her own journalistic errors Based on what you ve posted here no I think she experienced widespread harassment from thousands of people and experienced it as traumatic Nothing in this post suggests to me that her posting this was out of some sort of cunning calculation  gt Is it not likely that a male journalists would receive a comparable level of vitriol A good example of this is Jim Acosta even when confronted with absurd accusations he is an individual who always responds to critics with the underlying subtext that the most important thing for him as a journalist is his journalistic integrity Is our political discourse not polarized to the extent that which gender is far less important than  team  I certainly question whether a Fox News anchor would have encouraged people to go after a man and whether they would have done so Also I know that when people go after oppressed groups on the internet the  way they do so is often very different My male friends of color have been threatened with lynching deportation violence against their families etc my white friends have not My friends who are women or read as women have been threatened with rape often described in detail as a play by play  gt Are the swaths of men  and women who come to the defense of Lorenz not indicative of their desire to infantilize her and absolve her of her own mistakes Is it wrong to expect a certain level of tolerance of online spam from a journalist reporting on heated topics even if that journalist is a woman You re describing a targeted harassment campaign not  online spam

Feminism,1615554011,If men make it less socially acceptable for other men to attack women by saying something when they notice the other men around them being misogynistic it will be less socially acceptable for men to be violent towards women It s a very simple concept  It s work that men need to do because it just doesn t penetrate a lot of the time when women are saying it The men who are violent towards us often don t care what we think  you see because they don t respect us hence the violence  If other men let it happen it s pretty clear that they don t respect us enough to stop it That signals to the person who will be violent that its okay to disrespect women because no one will do anything about it regardless of whether it s right  People might tend to be violent but they re going to weigh whether they can get away with it and choose the path of least resistance So it is societal because it is behaviour that is ignored and sometimes rewarded by our society and that enables those that would be violent  We can t keep screaming into a void Its frekin exhausting and nothing changes if not everyone is on board

Feminism,1615550295,     It s a bit like a person living in an island in oceania and saying that they won t watch their local football league because the quality isn t as high as in the premier league It doesn t make sense   I disagree  that person has every right to watch the best football they can find or their local football or both or neither There is no right or wrong  Yeah I sounded a bit silly what I meant was that the commentators seemed to speak as if the only reason people would watch football is if it s high level enough It s like saying people would only want to watch fighting matches to see who would objective win and so only watch heavyweight and superheavyweight fights but  in reality we know that people are just as interested if not more interested in fights of lower weight classes including interest in women s fights All you need to do is not seperate out women or different weight classes  or different events An example I can give you is from Go In the west knowledge about Japanese professionals     I am strongly against having men s section and women s section in sports I think there should be just  Open section and  Women s section no need to exclude women to give them they re own space Are you scared that some women might win against too many men   I always used to be against that idea on the basis that it could be unfair on men who felt obliged to hold back a bit when up against women On reflection that is a very very poor reason   If anything I fear that the reverse is actually the problem  having an open football league and then having to explain that women can participate it s just that in the   years since the rule came in no woman has made the grade is unlikely to do much for women s sport Neither woudl it benefit women s sport if if was just like now only with the handful of superstars missing because they are playing in a non elite men s league Am I laying it on a bit think Maybe But what about  x   m relay Let s have a mixed team in the Olympics   women just aren t gonna make the cut And whilst football is about skill to a very large extent it is also all about physicality Take the english PL Excluding goalkeepers the players are pretty much all   to    with the vast majority of those between about   and    A   year old man who was  at his peak  one of the fittest and best players in the league has very little chance of being able to compete physically any more How is a     woman who runs      slower than a man gonna have a chance Their skill levels would have to be through the roof which is not realistic and may still not be enough When my team play  I ve just checked  we can put out a side which includes five tall players who can go forward to attack the ball from corners Those five players average     m or        ok so normally only four of them are playing but I ve just googled and Wendie Renard at     was the tallest player at the     world cup I m speculating here but I d guess that if you were to put together a women s team including all the tallest women s players who play international football they d risk losing to my favourite men s team simply on the basis of being out jumped at set pieces even if they matched my team in every other way It would be fascinating to see those women who could compete and at what level But I fear it would be an exception that proves the rule that women can t match the men physically rather than an inspiration to other women And this is nothing to feel bad about   a lightweight male boxer gets on with being the best at his size he doesn t worry that if he were in a bar fight with a heavyweight he d be dead in   seconds  I thought of the idea that in MMA that Women in the same weight class as men could fight with little problem if   On the day before the fight the woman would have to weigh in heavier  likely the man would try to weigh in near the bottom of the weight class while the woman would try to weigh in near the top of the weight class   Remove the illegality of some moves for the woman for example she can t use eye gouges but  can hit in the below the belt area and hit a floored opponent This may sound uncivillised but actually this is necessary so that the man doesn t take it easy on the woman If he felt his balls were at risk in a way hers weren t he wouldn t feel the need to go easy  amp  x   B I agree with you that  the Korean Wpmen s Baduk League gained  more coverage     than the male one which is the biggest baduk tournament in korea a country were  In the west we have more familiarity with the Korean baduk scene than the Chinese weiqi one even though

Feminism,1615550118, gt Universities are already finding women being just as if not more present in some courses where naturally time will let that flow through the other related statistics This is unfortunately much less true than we had hoped  Law schools for instance have had an equal gender split for a long time  The legal field beyond school remains extremely unequal  This pattern exists in many areas  Access to education does not necessarily create equal access to professional opportunities

Feminism,1615549800,I think OP is extrapolating from the requirement that people receiving unemployment actively search for a job in order to keep receiving benefits But that policy doesn t actually require unemployed people to apply for and take literally any open job regardless of duties or compensation  You re allowed to focus your search on the field where you actually want to work

Feminism,1615549618,I disagree with your premise  Failing to educate others on social justice really is complicity  I don t believe that very many people live such an insular life that they ve never encountered something problematic they just didn t notice  I live in a nice suburban area but do you know how many times I ve stopped my car while driving because a man on the street is yelling at a crying woman  Most of the time asking her  do you need help  Is enough to diffuse the situation but one time when I asked   can I bring you where you re going  The victim said yes and got in the car with me What would have happened to her if I d left her there If nobody had noticed No Its not enough for men to passively entertain the idea that violence against women is bad They can t let locker room talk slide and walk around with blinders and still get a pat on the back for what a good job they re doing

Feminism,1615549376, gt Why should women suffer with this disparity while men climb up I named billionaires and cops for a reason   these are deeply deeply oppressive things Not being able to exploit and oppress people isn t a form of suffering As for it taking a huge amount of time to dismantle them there have been tremendous strides in dismantling the police system in the United States in the past year I m not going to work on reforming the police system to make it more friendly towards women while striving to tear it down That just doesn t make any sense  gt Being progressive is not the only reason to have more women Women tend to know more about how it is to live life as a woman than a man So when women are there at the top and have the power to change things they will know how to make lives better for women and will be able to make that happen It s the same reason why we need to uplift minority groups too A black person in power will have lived the experience of being black and so they would know how to make lives better for black people I think there are reasons to have more  progressive women politicians But I don t agree that it s better to have a woman in a position of power than a man even if she s more conservative Women politicians have not always historically done more for women An anti choice politician who happens to be a woman is not a feminist victory Clarence Thomas s appointment to the Supreme Court was not a civil rights victory

Feminism,1615547415,did answer op s question YES     why do you care op got what they wanted
Feminism,1615547132,Virtually all of the assumptions behind this post are horrifically wrong Here s a breakdown  Unemployment benefits are a safety net and are given when you can t find employment in your branch In Germany for example they are paired with actively helping you find employment in your branch If I lose my job nobody is going to withhold my unemployment insurance  that I pay for out of my income because I don t want to be a coal miner let alone a sex worker  which is legal here  You are assuming that only women can be  expected to be sex workers under this model Sex work is work for everyone who wants to do it  Consent cannot be commoditised and in fact sex work is not a commodity It s not oil or gold you re not selling pussy futures on the NYSE It s a service that you offer     or more and can refuse to offer Just like any other professional doesn t sell  hours and get called up and forced to do those hours to whoever buys them I can refuse to work for oil companies  and I do  so can sex workers  in a context where they are treated like professionals and not a commodity refuse to work with a client they don t like of feel safe with Of course sex work and sexual exploitation are not the same thing A person willfully engaging in prostitution or any other form of sex work is a professional providing a service A person forced into sex work is in fact being commoditised objectified so I could imagine this is closer to what you mean by commoditising consent  it s not because there s no consent in such a scenario  Part of the problem of treating sex work as its own special thing  rather than work is that it opens many doors for exploitation I have the right as a professional to deny service to a company I dislike because I have legal protections from basic forms of workplace lock in that many sex workers do not This is also the case for most trafficked workers in e g sweatshops I would not engage in or consume sex work because it s not up my alley But it someone wants to fuck for a living they should have the same rights I do Period 
Feminism,1615546712,The idea behind this is that there are multiple issues that can be focused on at once More women going into fields that were typically associated with men get them more representation in that field because they re harder to talk over That being said if there are more women in certain fields there is a broader horizon we can use to talk about platforms that might otherwise be overlooked 
Feminism,1615546532,There are some communities that will answer your questions and there are other ones that will be quick to jump on you It sounds a lot like you asked something on Twitter Which is a pretty toxic place itself But there are places like this all over the internet I can t say that I know for sure but what was the question that you asked 
Feminism,1615546453,Yeah I get that I m trying to point out that it is in everyone s best interest to educate children call out shitty behavior don t just look the other way when you see something And if you don t feel safe doing it yourself go get help  I will help in any way I can when I see anyone that needs it and if I can t help I go get help Maybe it comes from a selfish place since I was beaten and dragged out of my own house while I begged his friend who just sat there looking me in the eyes and not even saying anything let alone doing something I never want anyone to feel that helpless and scared

Feminism,1615546254,There are a lot of things that can be done when you hear certain things out in the world The very first thing is believing women should they say something happened to them Some other things might include calling out objectification asking why people make certain jokes call women names after they do something they don t like or just asking your friends how they feel about certain things Sometimes people won t be openly aggressive should they feel that it s not something that they can get away with around you Or they might only do it when a woman is around them 
Feminism,1615545904,When someone says it s bad to want to be more feminine it s because that feminine is seen as lesser shallow or weaker There s nothing wrong with wanting to be more feminine If it s something that you like then by all means do what you like If anyone ever gives you a hard time just for looking the way you do They re probably not worth your time in the first place 
Feminism,1615545854,I agree but at the same time no one owes you education It s a lot of intellectual and emotional work for someone and you re not entitled to that work just because you ask and want to learn It s fine to ask questions but people aren t wronging you by not providing you with answers you can also seek by yourself in books videos lectures etc There s a lot of feminists here doing it tirelessly but that just makes them amazing  lt   that doesn t mean other communities fall short

Feminism,1615545484,It sounds like you re asking if women could do sex work legally if they should be denied unemployment benefits I think the focus should perhaps be on getting sex workers to the point where if they re trafficked they aren t charged for a crime Maybe getting them some rights should be the way to go there And if it was legal that s an extremely explicit job No one should be forced to take a job they aren t willing to take 
Feminism,1615563742,Right but that s different than what the two of you were arguing about before no  I guess that s what I m misunderstanding about your prior discussion As OP directly called out that scenario where one should get involved if you see it happening  But inactivity by  not forwarding posts on social media would you consider that as condoning male violence

Feminism,1615563684,To me I think the important thing is to just keep in mind the way discussing the beauty of women encourages men to act and makes women feel Like imagine you gave an hour long talk about a subject you re very knowledgeable in posted it online and every single comment was from someone saying you were really hot you were really ugly or that they liked your shirt or something  No one had anything to say about Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Networks or whatever you presented  They just wanted to talk about your body  Imagine that someone bigger than you and scarrier told you you were beautiful and then tried to follow you home Imagine how that might make you feel in other situations when others discussed your physical appearance And with that understanding in mind think about how you discuss women s bodies  So like  Wow I love polevaulting the athletes are so graceful is a thing you could say that is unlikely to devalue anybody but saying it about a specific female athlete might be a situation where you d want to be careful to not make her uncomfortable or encourage others to talk about her body 
Feminism,1615563524,Why should one temper the truth in order to coddle the fragile egos of those who barely consider you human It isn t always about trying to  win over the unconvinced  who are largely unconvinceable such as yourself  Sometimes the truth simply needs to be spoken For the world s most clich example I can think of a certain doctor who spoke the truth and was killed for it You really think that he should have begged like a lap dog at the feet of those with the guns

Feminism,1615563417,It s a derogatory term used first by Rush Limbaugh to describe feminists in general which is now often found in anti feminist circles to further the idea that feminists are dangerous irrational and militant People who use this term believe feminist critiques of society are akin to fascism and that feminists are seeking an oppressive regime that is anti man and anti free speech In this regime females strip males of their rights outlaw masculinity and use sex as a tool to enslave men People also just use it to describe feminists who aren t nice enough to them

Feminism,1615562578,I get why they do it but what if you can t make it for the allotted hour We definitely need more emphasis on stopping problematic behavior Once again it s asking women to modify their time while creepers carry on being creepers or whine about  being excluded from these times and spaces I used to go to a gym that had one room set aside just for women to work out in if they wanted to That s nice but personally I d like a room set aside just for gawkers harassers which they can be directed to when caught in the act I know it won t happen but it would make a point

Feminism,1615561898,I just want to add one point the argument  men get attacked more by strangers is such bullshit It doesn t take into account how many more precarious women take to not face strangers how women and not men are scared going out at night cross the street when they see a man carry self defence objects plan their lives around being safe  If women were out at night carelessly like men I m sure we d seen much higher numbers of women being attacked by strangers 
Feminism,1615561800, gt And yeah that kind of attitude can be a  result of male gaze in the media This helps a lot  gt But a woman was going about her day answering a question about her religion  She wasn t doing a makeup tutorial or showing off a new outfit or something else to indicate that she was soliciting your opinion on her physical appearance The comment was without context I can see how saying someone is beautiful out of the blue is a problem What if I m watching the Olympics Say the long jump or the gymnastics and comment that it s beautiful because of the movement It s not in the context of the sport so much I will dial it back but just thinking out loud 
Feminism,1615561636,Yeah I was really confused because they said that it was okay to want it but not to say it

Feminism,1615561272,I ve seen those two Aquila rift being the hack short 
Feminism,1615561243,You ve gotten me confused for someone else but you also actually haven t provided evidence for your assertion or answered my question you re just wildly misinterpreting unemployment policy 
Feminism,1615561047,Oh we can both play that Nowhere there does it say what you claimed 
Feminism,1615561046,So this is kind of a complicated question  The behavior you re describing isn t what I d call  male gaze   Male gaze means that a piece of media was produced presenting women in a way to cater to male sexuality The term I d give to your behavior is  sexualization   A woman was going about her day answering a question about her religion  She wasn t doing a makeup tutorial or showing off a new outfit or something else to indicate that she was soliciting your opinion on her physical appearance  You didn t have anything to say about what her opinion was you had to make it about how she looks and whether you do or don t find her attractive  And yeah that kind of attitude can be a  result of male gaze in the media  When you re raised with imagery that makes you feel like female bodies exist for your view it can result in men reducing women to their appearance and that s bad because it means that women are reduced to their bodies  Beautiful women are treated as if their only value is in their bodies and ugly women are treated as if they have no value whatsoever So what you do about it is absolutely you keep it to yourself about how attractive or unattractive you think a stranger is unless they re asking for your opinion  And when you create media you don t portray any person specifically for the sexual satisfaction of the audience unless you re producing literal pornography  Media should be about telling the story of the characters you re presenting or communicating the ideas you re trying to communicate 
Feminism,1615561042,Your friend is incorrect male gaze is an academic term that refers to film and media first and foremost What you did might be objectification  And as for  what s wrong with it  from a feminist perspective you already got a reply  reinforces the idea of women being sexual objects But it s also wrong from artistic perspective if it doesn t add anything to the story or character and especially if it contradicts story or character Example of it done correctly when it could easily be ruined in hands of       directors Mad Max Fury Road When Max first sees the wives cleaning themselves most male directors would film it as  Angelina Jolie in a shower  type of thing You know what I m talking about Instead he filmed it in a way that makes sense  Max lusts for water not women Women are framed neutrally in wide and medium shots without camera lingering on their attractive bodies  Example where it s done poorly  almost every fucking movie Basically you can film ass and tits but only if it makes sense And it doesn t makes sense in most cases I love showing recent Netflix anthology  Love Death and Robots  as an example Two shorts  Witness and Aquila Rift  has a lot of nudity But one is done with purpose and dare I say taste adding to the tone and story and the other is done because writer and director are talentless hacks who think naked women  good visual storytelling  If you compare the two shorts you ll notice that despite clear time and effort put into both one is good at all levels not just usage of nudity and another is bad at all levels  writing directing even character design  Basically male gaze is just bad writing in almost all cases 
Feminism,1615560998,Well then such requirements don t exist to the best of both of our knowledge So the original question stands for all persons that would be capable to do such work 
Feminism,1615560736,For bars gyms clubs etc this is awesome Whether or not it s exclusive to trans ppl depends on the venue and if they decide to discriminate I don t think a man can pass as a trans woman or at least take the effort to effectively do so LGBT ppl and POC should get their own too at some places It s nice to be among community and know you won t be harassed I don t think it needs to be everywhere but as a queer woman the idea of only being around other women or LGBT ppl sounds amazing
Feminism,1615560727,You do need at least some skills for sex work If you re just doing extremely low rent prostitution  like streetwalking maybe not as much but if you are going to be a cam girl or a pole dancer or an exotic dancer or do sensual massage or whatever that definitely requires skills equipment and physical ability And even if you were just streetwalking that gig comes with enormous risk to your physical safety So you can t really just brush that off

Feminism,1615560534,Maybe I m misunderstanding but I thought this post wasn t calling about inaction  like what happened in your experience but rather not out searching for trouble  Like if I saw something I could stop I would but I m also not patrolling streets or flying to Afghanistan Rambo Taken style to disrupt a sex trafficking ring  I believe OP was trying to make that distinction outside of  direct involvement  
Feminism,1615560496,It is work in that it requires skills time effort and risk I would not suggest that it is  just like any other job  though 
Feminism,1615560396,I m not getting this at all from the article It doesn t sound like she has a preference at all but rather worries about the equally difficult but different struggles of raising a child perceived as male or female  On mentioning she s rather have a girl  gt It occurs to me that as a younger person I d almost automatically imagined myself having a daughter   who had brown eyes and brown hair to mirror my own features a smaller version of myself  gt When I bring this thought to my therapist   she says   people may have children to  redo their own childhood They want to fix themselves and their traumas by trying again with a fresh start and a mini version of themselves She s afraid the child might be a girl  gt  To be perfectly honest  I tell my husband over dinner    I m not sure that I even know that I want a girl   I guess I d just never really thought about having a boy before   gt  I do worry a girl will have a lot to live up to as your daughter  he replies  That s a lot of pressure  I wince and think of my own mother and her tales of being homecoming queen   I think of the other physically beautiful mothers I ve known the stage moms with their own mini mes The way their daughters even as young girls seem to know their own beauty as if they have already lived entire lives in a grown woman s body   I still fight subconscious and internalized misogyny on a regular basis catching myself as I measure the width of my hips against another woman s Who is to say I d be able to protect my daughter from it And afraid of a boy too   gt I m scared of having a son   too   although   not in the same way   I ve known far too many white men who move through the world unaware of their privilege and I ve been traumatized by many of my experiences with them And boys too it s shocking to realize how early young boys gain a sense of entitlement    gt I m not scared of raising a  bad guy     But I m terrified of inadvertently cultivating the carelessness and the lack of awareness that are so convenient for men It feels much more daunting to create an understanding of privilege in a child than to teach simple black and white morality How do I raise a child who learns to like themself while also teaching them about their position of power in the world  She didn t make the list it was her friend in a period of exasperation postpartum depression and sleep deprivation   gt My friend who is the mother to a three year old boy   After a difficult birth experience she developed postpartum depression and decided that she resented her husband more than she d ever imagined possible   gt   She told me she particularly hated and she made an actual physical list that she kept in her journal editing it daily how peacefully he slept    There is nothing worse than the undisturbed sleep of a white man in a patriarchal world  She shakes her head   She also eventually learned to love her husband again The sound of his perfect sleep next to her at night is now tolerable

Feminism,1615560268, gt Forcing you to go work in a machine shop when you have no experience or knowledge of how to do so would be incredibly dangerous  While I agree with that that requires like you said training and experience No such thing is required of sex work correct So the comparison would not be valid 
Feminism,1615560165,Forcing you to go work in a machine shop when you have no experience or knowledge of how to do so would be incredibly dangerous just because you physically would be able to do a job doesn t mean you have the skills to do it and they re not going to hire you anyway because you don t know what you re doing and could get yourself or somebody else killed The fact that you could  potentially work heavy machinery doesn t translate to actual practical knowledge about how to do so Sex work is similar It requires a particular skill set that yes you  could acquire but which you don t currently have and therefore would not be effective at that job anyway 
Feminism,1615560159, gt there s just a lot of practical concerns here that can t be boiled down to  well if sex work is work why shouldn t everyone have to do it if they can  We are looking at the same date and I am not sure why you would conclude we should  still call it as just another form of work  despite all these practical concerns Surely all these practical concerns prove in fact that it is  not just another form of work 
Feminism,1615560140,   gt  We re not seeing anything new  she reiterates  The art world doesn t exist in a vacuum Being an object being objectified  creates a toxic culture because we don t have the same cultural influence as men do They ve written the story they have the power  gt   MeToo should not be limited to art or TV What s happening in the world where there s no glamour is worse There are powerless people in the world who don t have a voice who are struggling in this toxic culture of silence  What Hannah Gadsby says here is what I m thinking about Even as a reserved term aren t there wider societal implications If it s just art tv advertising then I m not sure what my mate is on about Cheers 
Feminism,1615559951,That s mainly a business decision Gyms realised that many women don t feel safe or comfortable to train with men so they don t come It s marketing to gain customers  Men don t seem to feel uncomfortable with women so they would work out one way or another I don t see why gyms would make men only hours when there s little demand for that I personally got to a women only gym for different reasons but no men being there was a factor I don t want my ass and face being judged when I m doing sport I can t avoid it on a daily basis but if there are spaces where I can I ll gladly take the opportunity 
Feminism,1615559939,I especially don t like the way she thinks of being out at night as something you can just stop being terrified of That terror is ingrained pretty deep into my mind as my parents were very strict about that and I lived in a nasty bit of California for a while where all my fears were reinforced  I didn t get raped or mugged or anything but I did see someone get beaten up on the streets and I watched a car blow up At this point it s just an irrational terror which I will probably never get over
Feminism,1615559913,I don t know how to explain to you that you re not going to be denied unemployment for not applying for and accepting a job that is not within your current ability in terms of skill  Like what do you think sex work actually is Again nothing about unemployment implies that you need to apply for and accept absolutely any job 
Feminism,1615559872, gt does anybody else view her support for ending the harassment of women online as primarily a means to absolve her of her own journalistic errors  I don t view it that way Harassment online is way past holding people accountable If she s receiving death threats due to an error it s clear that people were not simply making her know she fucked up   gt A good example of this is Jim Acosta  Who  gt Are the swaths of men  and women who come to the defense of Lorenz not indicative of their desire to infantilize her and absolve her of her own mistakes  Infantilize her Hmn I don t know I see this phenomenon way more with men with sayings such as  boys will be boys and  he s just       for example Could you give an example of comments that were defending them using infantilization as a tool  gt Is it wrong to expect a certain level of tolerance of online spam from a journalist reporting on heated topics even if that journalist is a woman  No one s obliged to tolerate hatred disguise as criticism and opinions It s wrong to think that those people have the obligation to endure personal attack and offensive comments because of their jobs   amp  x   B  gt Is it fair to attribute what happened  is happening to Taylor Lorenz as a womens issue  If she s receiving attacks that focus on her being a woman using this characteristic to offend her than it s a problem around women s issues as well as a problem with online harassment

Feminism,1615559841,I feel like she has good points and this is a really complicated topic that a thoughtful feminist could come down on either side of I went to a university that as one of its core tenets is integrated with the neighborhood it s built in  Other schools in my city are in  nicer areas of town and even then are built with these huge walled off campuses and green manicured lawns  My school isn t  The dorms and student buildings are built on residential streets in a low income area of town that s rapidly gentrifying with the student population there  It wasn t unusual to see neighborhood people at college events or just using the green as a park to play with their kids  Students from the neighborhood with the grades can go there for free And there was this weird attitude you d often encounter in the students there  They d joke frequently about the dangerousness of the neighborhood  Just really mean stuff calling specific streets names based on rape jokes and jokes about the murder of sex workers  It was an attitude that student groups and campus organizations fought against tooth and nail but they d also be really really loud about the message of  don t go out alone at night use this campus van to drive to take you to the grocery store  But also it was incredibly incredibly dangerous to go out on campus after dark  I had  close and personal friends get robbed at gunpoint  One year a female student got kidnapped and forced into a van and she kicked the shit out of her captors until they dropped her off  streets away  I luckily never was mugged  I never went anywhere alone after dark  but my car was broken into  times in  years and stolen once  It was completely appropriate to be cautious walking around campus at night  Completely appropriate But it wasn t that the surrounding neighborhood was full of shitty people  We were a bunch of fucking rich college kids in a low income area  Anybody who had it in their minds to mug somebody we were extremely easy targets  After I graduated I lived a couple streets down for the next  or  years  It was mostly families immigrants and people of color and every time it snowed we would all go out together and shovel all the driveways and the sidewalks and any time a car got stuck on the road we would all run over and push it out  Once I left the lights on in my car and my neighbor who spoke no English knocked on my door gestured me over and pointed it out to me  I have never had such kind and friendly neighbors  amp  x   B It s possible for attitudes about safety and danger to be both harmful and justified  You can be unfairly demonizing a whole neighborhood of people because of racism and instilling fear as a means of control in women and also be correct about the level of danger that people are in I don t know the right way to combat that  I think it s a difficult line to walk  I think that it s important to look at actual data to determine how dangerous something  actually is before you tell someone to change her behavior to avoid it  And to be careful of the way you talk about whole communities of people based on the crimes of a few committed there  It is a very hard line to walk but it s one that should be walked with compassion 
Feminism,1615559814,Sex work is both illegal and dangerous It would also be ridiculous to ask for example married people to engage in sex work and violate their marriage vows or risk not receiving unemployment benefits People should never be forced into doing sex work Having to resort to prostitution if you lose your job is the very definition of survival sex Also what if you re a terrible prostitute What if nobody wants you to use your services Then what You know there s just a lot of practical concerns here that can t be boiled down to  well if sex work is work why shouldn t everyone have to do it if they can

Feminism,1615559179, gt Do you think this is exclusionary to trans people I don t see how Trans women are definitely included at least in my perception in women only hours and locations   gt Should men also get an hour Why Which reason do they have to demand for a gym to make an exclusive male hour If they want to do this they re free to it But socially they have no problems about harassment as in the social aspect and behavioral norms to do so IMO Any company and business can determine exclusivity in their property If a coffee shop want to do a POC only hour a women only hour great they can But lgbtq  I can t even imagine how they d prove or not someone s sexuality and identity 
Feminism,1615559159, gt You re assuming that sex work is a labor market in which everyone or even most people possess skills for which isn t the case Would you mind being more specific There is nothing in legislation that require X or Y skill so what are you talking about 
Feminism,1615559147,That s not how unemployment works You get unemployment for a specific amount of time when you lose YOUR job When people in America lost their jobs due to the pandemic they didn t withhold benefits from people if there was a job opening at a gas station near them and they didn t apply for it Also in many places sex work is illegal so that wouldn t even enter into it

Feminism,1615559015,I edited my comment with  section from the source you provided listing another reason You re assuming that sex work is a labor market in which everyone possesses skills for which isn t the case 
Feminism,1615558951,They do not give jobs based on your ability to have on but based on your education qualifications and job experience Benefits in Italy last for  months if you are lucky you are going to have an interview at  months or even no interview and no job matching If you do menial jobs in general and you have passed the advisory stage and you are still inside those  months of receiving benefits and a menial job pops up within some radius of your home yes typically you would be cut off of them if you refused Emphasis on if you do menial jobs

Feminism,1615558413,      You can t turn down work and retain benefits for reasons such as     You make more on unemployment than you would at the job you ve been offered     You don t want to work     You are nervous about returning to work but do not have another accepted reason to refuse Not wanting to do sex work is not the same as not wanting to work at all This is also based on accepting work that a person is applying for and there s no stipulation that a person must apply for absolutely any kind of work they just have to be on an active search and accept work if they receive an offer from a job they applied to Excluding sex work isn t any different than excluding any other line of work from a job search
Feminism,1615558402,Can  someone who is capable of doing a job still receive unemployment benefits if they refuse to take such an opening 
Feminism,1615558284,Feminists don t  remain neutral on men s issues You ve completely misunderstood this quote

Feminism,1615557838,I guess that means babies are on the side of allowing violence against women at birth  Obviously joking but the point stands Ignorance of a topic is not the same as having a conscious stance on it You cannot treat people who do know know or understand the same as those who understand but choose the wrong side If you do you actually risk pushing people the wrong way Statements like this do that Inform and advocate Stop shaming 
Feminism,1615557629,It s equally offensive to women and Jewish people speaking as someone in both groups Comparing gender equality to nazism is a big tell about someone s views on both

Feminism,1615574751,I dunno but I don t think it justifies men sending women unsolicited dick picks Almost all people like chocolate  does that mean I should  make everyone eat chocolate 
Feminism,1615574732,By  biology I mean partly the fact that men are often taller and stronger than women and they have penises that they can use to rape It s influenced also by societal factors of course But at the end of the day there s only one sex who can forcibly impregnate the other 
Feminism,1615574698, gt Rather than focusing on  missing white women syndrome and calling it out we should be talking actively about those who are not brought to the spotlight on account of their lack of privilege I think we can focus on both 
Feminism,1615574651,I don t understand why asking this question is treated with hostility Can anyone explain 
Feminism,1615574585,What can also often pass as sly hostility under the guise of criticality is trying to  quiz people about specifically controversial figures because you are seeking a particular outcome from the conversation  ie you already have your opinion about this person but want that to be either validated or invalidated by others in this forum for your own reasons I don t take particularly kindly to people who do that because I think it s disingenuous and not really in the spirit of camaraderie  in asking you to provide context about a person who has subsequently been proven to be controversially feminist  I m helping other readers both learn to investigate new subjects or speakers and better evaluate information and claims for themselves I think that s a useful contribution even if I am not personally an expert or authority on this particular person or their body of work The fact that it has resulted in a hostile response from you suggests to me anyway that my instinct towards criticality is being appropriately applied 
Feminism,1615574530,The only  stereotype I am  promoting is the fact that men are more dangerous to women than the reverse and that fact is what explains the generalised difference that the OP asked about Of course it s not true of every man 
Feminism,1615574369,That s why I m talking to you not OP I m not sure it s helpful to convince people not to support Paglia or explain why she s not great but I m happy to talk to feminists about it  I figured this hadn t passed you by either  
Feminism,1615574363,I would refrain from making generalizations on men being ok with cat calling and sexual assault It promotes harmful stereotypes of men always wanting sex and being ok with physical boundaries being pushed  Even when you re not in physical danger you can be violated and those feelings are valid regardless of gender And physical force is not the only dynamic at play in every situation also could you explain what you mean by  biology 
Feminism,1615574263,Yes women and their sexuality generally aren t perceived as aggressive and threatening A woman s sexuality is considered dishonourable to herself at worst 
Feminism,1615574191,Thank you  I have since also reviewed her wiki and came to much the same conclusions especially re that line about Hoff Sommers This is what ultimately makes me feel that OP s general ask about feminists feelings on her is more than a little leading and perhaps even a bit disingenuous  I personally don t count folks who self identify as libertarian as particularly effective feminists and the deeper one goes into examining her body of work and her beliefs  the more dubious it is that she is in fact representative of modern feminism in anything but name 
Feminism,1615573704,Oh I never thought of this and I agree I think the    novelty of it for the lack of a better term is a big part of the appeal I also came across a tweet that said men would actually welcome being inappropriately flirted to in gaming communities because they lack attention and affection overall which had like a few thousand or so likes I think it s a similar case If you re really  literally thirsty even seawater will taste satiating 
Feminism,1615573460,In that situation Muslims have reason to fear pervasive discrimination and violence because some people do actually believe they are all extremists that to me is the biggest difference 
Feminism,1615573447,Dick pics are a latent threat There s no threat presented by receiving a picture of a vulva It s why men on the whole respond positively also to women cat calling or touching them in public What s she going to do attack him with her vulva Sure some women are violent blah blah blah but on aggregate the threat presented to men by women is so low it s nearly zero The threat presented to women by men is much higher So i believe it is in a way to do with  biology but absolutely not because men  have higher sex drives or  are socialised to  Men can rape and kill us much more easily than we can do any harm to them Of course we respond differently 
Feminism,1615573397,Of course But that is not the premise in your original question  AOC is my people but some  girlboss CEO enriching herself at the expense of her exploited workers and society at large is not empowering This is not something I would aspire to as as woman We don t need more billionaires not even black lesbian disabled ones I would rather have an old white dude with progressive policies that shares the profits of the company with its workers 
Feminism,1615573359,Men aren t bombarded with vagina pics or unwanted advances      frankly with any advances but that s a different topic  This likely has to do with their perception of these occurrences when they do happen 
Feminism,1615573351,Racists certainly would consider that derailing when they want to spew ignorant hate in peace 
Feminism,1615573191,The closest corollary to  NotAllMen would be  AllLivesMatter In both cases they were created to seemingly counter a statement no one was making  that  literally all men are rapists abusers or that  other groups deserve to be killed by cops  and all they each ultimately serve to do is undercut the expression of a legitimate problem 
Feminism,1615572892,Amazing I wish there were women only cars on subway trains especially 
Feminism,1615572878,I agree that many people use NotAllMen in bad faith to derail conversation If someone post     said NotAllMuslims would that be considered derailing the conversation on the threat of religious extremism in the Middle East 
Feminism,1615572731,Sure Don t pretend that But it s empowering to women and progressive in terms of equality as long as the person elected actually wants to do those things right 
Feminism,1615572728,Just so ya know the reason there aren t men only gyms is because there isn t enough of a demand for them There s just no money to be made in men only gyms
Feminism,1615572643, gt No because cis men don t experience violence or harassment in gym settings related to their gender identity I d put a caveat on that one While it s not really relevant in the context of a gym I think it s fair to have specific time slots at venues for specific groups in other settings Everyone needs a safe space sometimes  It can be harder for men to open up about certain issues in a mixed setting for example than in a group that they know consists mostly of other men who are dealing with the same issues 
Feminism,1615572409,I m fine with it depending on the context A store that is  Whites Only all the time has a different connotation than  Women s Hour Tuesday    PM or  Weekly Bisexual support group   amp  x   B  gt Do you think this is exclusionary to trans people I don t think that women only is exclusionary to trans people Trans women are women and should be allowed in those spaces Anyone trying to keep trans women out isn t doing it because of a women only space they re doing because they re opposed to trans people to begin with  gt Should men also get an hour    gt    gt Should other groups e g races LGBT etc also get their own time slots Sure why not I know a few spaces in my city that have men s only hours that either host support groups for men open a safe space for men to discuss issues they think are specific to them or just give a space for gay men to mingle without dealing with drunk sorority girls They re also welcoming of trans men I don t have a problem with time slots as long as they re just that Specific times slots that can be dedicated to specific groups or topics while the business is open to everyone at all other times 
Feminism,1615572048,Yeahhh like i watch far too much true crime so even though i myself havent had many experiences where ive been in danger i remember all the murdered women and girls i read about everytime i go out  at night I can t just flip a switch and forget those stories and just stop being nervous And it is defo verging on irrational but if that irrationality saves my life at some point then im not complaining haha 
Feminism,1615571856,If it s a private venue it seems ok   gt Is it exclusionary to trans people  If trans women are allowed during this hour no If trans women aren t allowed during this hour yes   gt Should men also get an hour Do men want an hour If so they could speak to management and if there s enough demand they could get their special hour  gt Should other groups e g races LGBT etc also get their own time slots Probably not But it would depend on the kind of venue It would also probably be good for it to be optional 
Feminism,1615571705,I am a WOC and while I would like more political representation from WOC for their diverse perspectives I am not going to pretend that having a woman in a position of power does anything for equality unless she is interested in uplifting others and dismantling systems of oppression Too often female politicians are simply there to maintain the status quo while providing better optics No thanks 
Feminism,1615571673,Yes I know But in the second wave there were people pushing the idea that femininity not only hegemonic femininity  was inherently inherently patriarchal and that the only reason a woman would want to be feminine is because she was brainwashed by patriarchy A lot like the idea that political lesbians held that the only reason that they were straight  women was because of patriarchal influence And I didn t said that the idea that femininity is bad did originate with feminists but there were feminists who  have equated femininty with being weak and conforming to the standards men set for women  
Feminism,1615571636,One thing that I ve seen happen a lot is people who do not take a side and try to stay neutral actively look the other way when things are happening or even deny it happens I think that s a horrible thing to do and only helps the patriarchy abusers and yes makes them on the side of allowing it to happen By looking the other way you are actively helping the other side However there is a spectrum between that  or worse and actively being on our side and not all positions are equally bad 
Feminism,1615571600,Right Like have they considered that all the precautions we take is one of the  reasons we re attacked at a lower rate And also that physical violence isn t the only thing to be wary of    of women in the uk have been sexually harrassed most people i know have had instances of being followed home or approached by random men or have had abuse yelled at them from across the street So to say that the streets arent dangerous is incredibly misinformed because although i dont know anyone who s been murdered almost every woman i know has been in a dangerous situation that could have escalated if not for the precautions they took at the time 
Feminism,1615571388,Yeah You could say she s gone astray in philosophical indulgence On the matter of child sexuality it sort of beckons back to this       French petition against age of consent laws

Feminism,1615571091,You can tell a lot by who supports her conservatives reactionaries like Jordan Peterson Not mainstream feminists unless you mean  feminists like fellow conservative Christina Hoff Summers  Something I didn t realize until looking her up just now she is also pro pedophilia  WTF  gt Camille Paglia has for almost three decades unrepentantly advocated for the legalization of sexual contact between adults and children of  any age  as well as the legalization of child pornography She is a pro pedophilia advocate who has repeatedly given her support to NAMBLA  the North American Man Boy Love Association  and has gone on record numerous times to state that she thinks  kiddie porn should be legalized  gt In Paglia s mind children are being harmed not by sexual contact with adults but by society s stigma surrounding pedophilia  gt  gt The damage from many pedophiliac encounters probably comes as some psychologists suggest less from the contact itself than from the culturally enforced stress and secrecy surrounding it   gt She also explained that the way to put an end to under age sex tourism in third world countries was to replace Christian morality in the West with  a more liberal pagan one that would allow for adults to freely court children for sex in our own societies In her mind the  sexual borderline between adults and children is an artificial construct that society would benefit from deconstructing  Lolita melts the sexual borderline that society has artificially drawn between child and adult    Well learning this definitely ruined my morning 
Feminism,1615571024,I have no  very specific opinion regarding her May I ask how you deduced that I m quite new to her writing myself I ve come here to get engage in some insightful discussion and bounce ideas If you haven t any knowledge of her obviously such a question would seem generalist   for those who know her will understand how such an open ended question fits here and lends itself to telling opinions It suffices to ignore the post if you haven t any useful contribution to make Sly hostility under the guise of criticality isn t the slightest bit noble 
Feminism,1615570975,The one good thing to the term was that it was from my experience an acceptance of masculinity in girls Notably there isn t an equivalent for feminine boys seen as the worse  I actually like thinking of my little self as tomboy it was a point of pride not negativity what was negative was the attitude I then took towards feminine girls and the color pink I think it did help me notice gender issues more as I didn t understand why I was treated so differently then boys despite thinking we were one in the same in our hobbies and such I also believe I may have higher levels of testosterone then most women and maybe that plays a small part in girls masculinity  or what society perceives as masculine behavior hobbies 
Feminism,1615570596,something to consider that i havent seen anyone bring up yet womens only hours at gyms are also good for women who wear hijab or other religious garb Many of them are able to take off their hijab headscarf in front of other women but not in front of men It can be difficult hot to work out in hijab so being able to take it off for an hour at the gym is a nice thing for them 
Feminism,1615570377,I haven t actually read any of her books This post is very likely the first I heard of her  I looked up her wiki and she doesn t even have a  controversies section  thus why I asked for more context I think it s rather peculiar to already have a very specific opinion about someone  but not share it and then come ask an extremely general question about the person 
Feminism,1615570249,There always seems to be men at my gym pool just hanging around in the pool and not swimming it is really uncomfortable The men also hog the jacuzzi and steam rooms and I can t go in there as the only women when  or  middle age dudes are taking up all the space Would love a women s hour   
Feminism,1615570106,The issue is what time would work It would be difficult to pick a time that everyone who wants to make it to those hours wouldn t be able to Likewise someone excluded from those hours might already have a relationship with the gym where they were working out at a specific hour that worked for them based on their schedule and they may now get kicked out of the gym for that time if that ends up being the women s only hour that the gym chooses That would present some pretty serious legal issues So it s kind of hard to establish women only hours at pre established gyms where you might have to dislocate people who were already there at that hour and can t work out at a different time I really only see it working for a business that is just starting and having it pre set from the beginning so members know exactly when they are allowed when they first sign up Another option is to build women designated rooms as extensions to gyms But the issue with that is if there will be enough women that would justify spending money adding an extension to the building 
Feminism,1615570078,I lived in a neighborhood where some gyms had women only classes to accommodate a religious group that was a big part of the neighborhood where the women wouldn t be able to work out with men within the rules of that religion I felt conflicted about it because I disagreed with those rules but was happy that these women had access to that space and time where otherwise they wouldn t  Also lived in a neighborhood where a bar geared toward college students had a women only hour where beer was   for that hour Then once the women were drunk they d let in the men That s for sure bad and scary 
Feminism,1615569881,I mean in relation to her individualist take on feminism Do you concur to her aphorisms on the modern decadence of womanhood to self  infantilisation and so on I find most feminists  particularly womxn find her ideas riddled with fallacy 
Feminism,1615569255,Our local climbing gym also has a  ladies night and it s honestly so much nicer to go when Climbing Dudes tm aren t all over the place hogging all the routes and being weirdly competitive with everyone there 
Feminism,1615569005,My favorite example would me lesbian porn Extreme example but common sense would dictate that it would be for lesbians to enjoy Yet it s designed almost completely for men 
Feminism,1615568586, gt You filter people based on trustworthiness and a man playing as a woman automatically gets a  deception point added to his list even if it s obvious that he is a man Why 
Feminism,1615568556,It needs a lot of work Parts of the early series with Howard being a sleazy character for example and a lot of the jokes just aren t funny and are in very bad taste or unacceptable on rewatching I truly enjoy watching the performances though especially Kunal Nayyar s evolution and learning a tiny bit more about science 
Feminism,1615568551, gt Maybe you have a better one Yes I have one  I made a journalistic error 
Feminism,1615568426,Now that I think about it I am way more uneasy at home than in public Childhood sexual abuse in the home I always think someone or something is going to pop out and fuck me up   I m taking a med for it but it only works sometimes At least the dreams stopped On foot in public I think a lot about how much less willing someone would be to fuck with a confident looking naturally scowling person Shoulders back neck high brisk pace scowl for days   it makes me feel invincible 
Feminism,1615568169,It s interesting how paradoxical situations can lead to similar advice Because there s a lot of danger in being seen as prey but there s also quite some danger being seen as a predator as well 
Feminism,1615568082,It s so cool that you re reading Dworkin That makes me really happy Its kind of rare to meet someone so open minded  I d also recommend  intercourse by her it s a bit depressing but really interesting I m excited to have a conversation whenever you get back to me  
Feminism,1615568036,I m a dude so my input is you know what it is But remember that you can change doctors And you can tell them and their employer why 
Feminism,1615568020,That s not actually the same as feminists setting the standard for feminity being bad Plenty of women rejected the expectation of hegemonic femininity before second wave feminism 
Feminism,1615567970,Sure That s a good point But as for the messaging and the lag inherent somethings missing where progress is either stopped by not being up to date or as I ve asked hindered by messaging ill suited to younger people University drop out rate may be a huge factor I m a drop out Between both sexes law school has a high failure rate and the main reason I see people pick law is that coming out of high school as it is now  standard to try pursue higher education those that see law as the best fit to their personality may be more in line with excelling in environments more focused on wholistic goals By that I mean law school is hell and usually only the most studious competitive and some mix of self esteem and narcissism really excel Giving messaging about breaking the glass ceiling might lead more socially minded people to pick the wrong profession Or perhaps more likely law school is fine law is fine law school might not need and revision or aid and that the fact that the post graduate opportunities are controlled by people      years older than law school graduates might mean that any changes to law school would unjustly push for for things that time is already set to fix I e when the generations shift the problem may reveal it self to be already solved So what s the harm in pushing people to a field like that Well beyond balance it s a costly road mentally and financially 
Feminism,1615567743,My eyes bleed with this shit Men aren t fucking animals that can t control their shrimp dicks and eyes  Good way to say you re a shit person 
Feminism,1615567737,Just commenting to let you know that I will respond in full in the future Im in the process of reading Pornography Men Possessing Women It seemed the most pertinent to the discussion although I would happily read any others you might suggest For now I ll I say that I don t believe most males derive sexual pleasure from violence and even amongst those who do I dont believe that based on hatred of women There is also probably a discussion to be had about depictions of sexual violence vs acts of sexual violence and how we parse the idea of  harm in those scenarios In any case Ill get back to you soon 
Feminism,1615567490,Our snowboard places have  Women s only night in the terrain parks and it s honestly great It s a sport so dominated by showoff territorial dudes that women are intimidated to go into the park and work on skills There are several terrain parks around so the guys don t get shut out completely so no one complains about it I ve mastered a lot of tricks that I would never have dared attempt on a  normal night with guys judging me and pushing me to get out of the way And I ve made a lot of friends with women I might otherwise not have met or been intimidated by because of their skill level   I d imagine trans women would be welcomed as well I don t have any firsthand knowledge about it but it s a safe space 
Feminism,1615567382,Then those men need to learn to control themselves not to expect women to change their routine so they don t  distract them Men not being able to keep their eyes to themselves is not women s problem to solve 
Feminism,1615567157, gt Feminists haven t done this the patriarchy has At least according to Julia Serano s Wipping girl second wave feminists were often pushing a  feminity is bad line 
Feminism,1615566391,I think it s kind of weird to think that  it doesn t take skill to engage in vanilla sex acts in a way that is pleasurable for the person  of said acts especially if one s livelihood is tied to that Like I ve never performed oral sex on a person with a penis I COULD But I would also suck at it pun intended 
Feminism,1615566381, gt It does   SWERFs aren t generally particularly welcome in this sub You do realize one can criticize the industry right What of sex workers that also criticize it and want out of it Are they SWERF sex workers And no reply to my other points 
Feminism,1615566340,Yes there is   within certain limits The  The job will not make use of your training or skills listed as a good cause for turning down a job is about refusing a job you don t want to I really do not see how somebody could read the document you ve linked and take out of it that you have to take a job in a domain unrelated to your studies and previous jobs 
Feminism,1615566202,Thank you In what sense is this interpreted  de votre formation de vos qualifications de vos connaissances et comp tences professionnelles It can be interpreted in two ways right  You can refuse work you are not qualified for  or  You can refuse work if your qualifications are too high   Does it mean one can refuse work they are otherwise able to do For example can an expert accountant refuse a job related to primary  menial accounting tasks 
Feminism,1615565920,I m not a trans dude but I m transmasculine nonbinary I wouldn t go to a women s hour even if it s advertised as trans inclusive beyond trans women alone I m not a woman I find that trans men and nonbinary people are often lumped into things with women and it does feel invalidating to me You can ask another trans person and they may not agree though I understand the intention but it is invalidating for me to be lumped in with women for a women s event when I m not a woman Also as a nonbinary person I am not always safe with women either If they want to be lgbtq inclusive and dedicate safe time to that community separately I d prefer that 
Feminism,1615565868,Before COVID I would only go to the gym YMCA etc when I knew there wouldn t be a lot of people or when I knew the area I was working in would have a staff member employee  like classes   Being the only person in the in the weight room with boobs surrounded by dudes that are    X bigger than me is straight up uncomfortable  especially when one attempts to talk to me or flirt with me Dude how would  you feel about  your workout being interrupted  Most individuals are not looking for a date when they are sweaty and gross It s happened multiple times in recent years enough that I built a mini gym at my house  Now during COVID it helps a lot but once this is all over I would totally support a  female hour if that is possible I have never seen it in practice are there any gyms organizations that do this I would love to do laps in a pool without wondering  why the guy sitting on the end  not swimming is just staring at me  Just a heads up in case you didn t know trans women are women If you deem yourself a woman you are a woman There is no test I m not worried about defining what a woman is especially at the gym If you are a woman who wants to work out with other women that would be the whole point of a  female women s hour at a gym  A ladies hour at the gym could encourage friendship and accountability between women who would not otherwise meet 
Feminism,1615565720,Oh Then in that case yes I definitely object to that 
Feminism,1615565708,I served in the military and of all the traumas I could have faced as I traveled the country I was violated in my own apartment by someone I served with and I trusted enough to let inside We absolutely need to teach about people and situations not places and times 
Feminism,1615565666,Not sure why you think so I mean I doubt you d prefer I hang out with MRA s Not that I d start even if you did because they re awful 
Feminism,1615565632,The purpose of this sub is to build bridges It was established specifically as an off shoot of  r feminism where only feminist supportive educated commentary is allowed Because of that many users who participate here in nested comments are not feminists and we allow all people to participate in said comments provided they do not break our rules about bigotry transphobia trolling or respect and courtesy If you are looking to participate in a subreddit that does not allow anyone but feminists to participate then yes you are in the wrong place This is not  supporting misogynists  it is  having a dialogue  and hopefully  educating and  clarifying  If that s not your bag then you re better off at  r feminism 
Feminism,1615565595,I acknowledge it  benefits from skill but it can be  and is performed without skill too 
Feminism,1615565531, gt if your claim is that unskilled sex work is particularly dangerous So what is  your position Is it particularly dangerous or is it just another type of work Just to be clear I personally consider it rape for any circumstance where someone does it because they need the money as economic need cannot coexist with valid sexual consent  gt Most sex workers would qualify as either indepdent contractors or small business owners depending on the scale of their practice  So how do you deal with a brothel that would list waged labor An example from Germany  A brothel owner in the historic German town of Gvrlitz on the Polish border is preparing to open his establishment next month but faces a one last serious problem  he has no staff Ulrich Kueperkoch s adverts seeking  hostesses for erotic services for his Golden  Privatclub have been rejected by Germany s Federal Labor Office even though prostitution is legal in the country The dispute with the labor office stems from its refusal to allow advertising for prostitutes in the network of job placement agencies that it runs A spokesperson said that the labor office has  decided not to be active in that market sector due to its belief that such work could infringe on an individual s rights if he or she is forced to take the job Kueperkoch insists he would only employ those who were interested and not those who felt they had no other choice     gt you seem to be assuming that legalized sex work would continue to be carried out in an unregulated environment where most business was cash based Or you could stop putting words in my mouth I would object to that industry even if the services would be performed in the ICU of the hospital if that makes any difference 
Feminism,1615565418,I don t know what comment was but I can see that lots of outrageously misogynistic comments have been allowed to stand  Why are MRA assholes even allowed in here They are clearly not discussing this in good faith they re just here to try to pump themselves up by putting down women  In any case this sub clearly needs me a lot more than I need it because no one else was really responding to this heinous bullshit I m certainly not going to waste anymore time on a supposedly feminist sub that supports misogynists 
Feminism,1615565050,You ve got to be kidding Seriously you re in the wrong sub 
Feminism,1615564743,Ah ok I think I get it now Thanks for clarifying 
Feminism,1615564685,Mention of BDSM consensual impact play You should see how difficult is to wield my cat o nine tail   Whipping butts consensually is hard 
Feminism,1615564623, gt But inactivity by  not forwarding posts on social media would you consider that as condoning male violence Only in the case where it coincides with a total and utter lethargy regarding the acknowledgement of violence against women I don t think this discussion is about what the  right kind of support is since there clearly are thousands of ways to support rather the difference between doing anything and doing nothing at all Of course one does not even need a social media account in the first place to support gender liberation 
Feminism,1615564619,This sounds snarky but I swear I m not trying to be But a better question is  Why not   I ve used fem avatars since forever especially when I m doing literate roleplay People are consistently surprised that I am a man since my avatar and most of the characters I write for are women or at least very fem I just consider it part of gender expression I do feel womanly sometimes sorta But it doesn t encompass my entire life so I express that through writing women and sometimes using feminine avatars I do make it a point now a days to somehow drop my real gender when I meet people online lest I unintentionally fool them 
Feminism,1615564511,If you can read Italian n         is about urgent provisions in Genoa which is   obvious  from the   title   but you cannot read it so I do not understand what you are trying to do here exactly Not to mention the site again has the requirements and the process for unemployment and has a link to the respective articles too 
Feminism,1615564386,If the offer is not  reasonable with regards to your skillset then yes    
Feminism,1615564303,Help me out what cause doesn t intersect with gender oppression 
Feminism,1615564243, gt People have made false accusations in the past and people media run with it destroying peoples lives or careers for really no reason What s really sad is that women who speak up have their lives and careers destroyed 
Feminism,1615564189,You make some very good points and there is no easy solution I had a similar college experience though less extreme It always bothered me how much people would talk about the  bad neighborhood  because it felt like covert racism I prided myself on having ventured more into the neighborhoods than most people biking or skating I had mostly very positive interactions with people there The few times when I felt scared in retrospect I don t know whether someone was actually threatening me or whether I have just been taught to think that Yet either way as much as I wish it weren t the case it s impossible to deny that violence is a problem in these neighborhoods and that some people are taken advantage of 
Feminism,1615564126,You ve painted a picture I won t forget about anytime soon Damn 
Feminism,1615564021,   there are also laws regarding workplace safety standards and gendered labor requirements People are not obligated to accept unsafe work or unsafe working conditions  if your claim is that unskilled sex work is particularly dangerous than it would track with our previous claims that UI compensation would not be contingent on someone especially of a specific gender accepting that kind of work simply because  it is available   That s not how UI laws work in spirit or in practice  in the US or literally any other place that has a UI system and associated labor laws Most sex workers would qualify as either indepdent contractors or small business owners depending on the scale of their practice In addition to marketing and promotion scheduling and basic customer service interaction skills sex workers have to also have the financial management skills to track and report their own income and expenses  they could outsource some of this labor at cost but as independent contractor that still requires a certain amount knowledge about bookkeeping There are also matters of health and safety navigating insurance etc  a legal sex work environment would include a lot of same basic adherence to the standards of other service based businesses  you seem to be assuming that legalized sex work would continue to be carried out in an unregulated environment where most business was cash based  That s a deeply incorrect and fallacious assumption and like your other fallacious assumptions it undermines the majority of your  argument  
Feminism,1615563837,Would that be this one or Where is it said there  
Feminism,1615563795, gt I ve learned it takes all kinds and different people have different strengths The writer may not be an eloquent public speaker The person who works behind the scenes may not be comfortable protesting in a crowd The person that trys to educate on an individual basis because they connect better that way may not have things posted on social media And the movement leader from a year ago may now be battling cancer and no longer has the energy to devote to a cause  But isn t this exactly what she s implicitly lauding All of the things one might do to resist the status quo 
Feminism,1615581916,Please don t pit people here against each other like this I really don t appreciate it and it s really very hostile on your part for someone who has spent so much energy complaining that  we re not being nice enough as a community for you You aren t entitled to use my patience for engaging with you as a weapon against someone else  especially since you ve since gone on to abuse my patience and good will as well 
Feminism,1615581905,Some questions come across as a deliberate attempt to upset or rile up feminists Especially when the questions come across as willfully ignorant Women have been informing men for quite some time on what is acceptable how we want to be treated  as equal human beings of worth and on what behaviour we find unacceptable and the reasons for it all Men know the answers to these questions most of the time so the people that ask certain questions seem like trolls For example someone asked recently  why do women wear revealing clothes if they don t want to be stared at  It was a ridiculous question meant to upset people that s why it was downvoted   This is just my opinion one why SOME questions are downvoted 
Feminism,1615581888,No This is an authoritary posture and infringement of rights and probably would cause the increase of violent crimes due the restriction And would make men hate and blame women even more 
Feminism,1615581788,Exactly this and I also think it s partly because it s a dating app I think the percentage that like it wpuld go down  probably not too too much though if it was another platform 
Feminism,1615581768,Thank you for reminding me that no good deed goes unpunished 
Feminism,1615581689,From the comments on their profiles I doubt this person is actually a feminist at all 
Feminism,1615581542,Male gaze is typically used to describe the portrayal of women not the audience s reception of portrayal of women Your friend probably meant to say that you immediately jumped to a  beautiful ugly category of consideration when you saw a woman but didn t do so for men which might be indicative of something but that is not what male gaze is about 
Feminism,1615581506,Women only hours don t exist because women are insecure about their bodies and afraid of working out in front of attractive men They exist because of the sexual harassment and safety issues women face in a typical gym environment 
Feminism,1615581234,I clarified that harassing men in my point of view and from what I know from statistics is an individual problematic not a social norm and behavior 
Feminism,1615581161,I apologise for eventually running out of energy against the barrage from this community 
Feminism,1615581159,You re a fellow feminist yet don t understand other feminist views Seems a little low effort or simply ignorant  I won t ask around Provide me surveys about men feeling uncomfortable and about men only gyms being bashed 
Feminism,1615581035,Your passive aggressive attitude is not doing you any favours either I think we all really could ve done without this response from you 
Feminism,1615580908,Those men are sexists Women get better car insurance in my country because women cause fewer accidents than men  this is a fact So the belief that women suck at driving is purely sexist and ignorant and some men say this to hurt us and make us seem like inferior people 
Feminism,1615580895,I was pretty clear I don t care about the points A lot of people here seem able to read my mind and correct that It s   strange that they know so much about my motives but still can t speculate on why some question is downvoted 
Feminism,1615580614,It s not a systematic problem that women get harassed in gyms either   by definition it s not systematic because there is no law or federal systems in place which enable it     women getting harassed in gyms isn t nearly as common a problem as this thread would have you believe I have worked in a gym for   years and in that entire time we have only had two problems of  men harassing women and they were immediately expunged from the gym and had their memberships revoked Making eye contact is not harassment Saying hello isn t harassment either  We have also investigated alleged issues of harassment by women when upon investigation turned out the guy was just asking to engage in conversation or give her some lifting tips because her form was dangerously off Just because you make eye contact with a guy in the gym and you attractive doesn t mean he is harassing you or is picturing you naked This seems like an overt demonization of men  The  women s only hours are for women who feel self conscious working out  in front of men or who don t like the  meathead aspect of working out in a male dominated gym  Or Sometimes it s something as simple as not wanting to hear the grunting and the dropping of weights  This notion that there is some epidemic of men harassing us in gyms is just patently false Men feel self conscious when working out too Men feel  body awareness as well especially when they are overweight working out around gorgeous       hyper athletic women  Do you think that men  especially short weak or overweight men aren t capable of being self conscious or ashamed of their body in front of the opposite sex The idea of women getting women s only buisness hours is strictly as advantage for us that effects only us  Yet we are all dancing around calling it what it is on some misinformed wishy washy anecdotal evidence which isnt representative of the norm  It is a double standard that works in the favour of us women Plain and simple  Yet for some reason no one on this thread wants to recognize that women have any advantages in society over men 
Feminism,1615580609,Hey Thanks again Of course we can t read other people s minds but we can typically see why some comments are downvoted to hell Everywhere else on reddit it s pretty transparent  to me  but it s super not clear here  to me  I m really surprised people would consider that comment islamophonic  my understanding was that it was being held as a parody like  wouldn t it be ridiculous for people to say that about Muslims so why is it different for  allmen   Anyway thanks for engaging with me 
Feminism,1615580303,I would wager that your threshold for what qualifies as  hostile and  attacking is extremely low but sure 
Feminism,1615580235,I really don t understand the insistent hostility nor the semantic pedantry It s completely clear that a community downvoting a comment doesn t accept it Anyway someone else has kindly started to engage with me so you don t need to keep attacking

Feminism,1615580038, gt When men try to open up their own gyms they get labelled as misogynists and get vandalized protested There are a lot of gyms that are functionally men only the ones that were around ended up getting shut down because no one was using them IIRC
Feminism,1615579823,Thank you for your answer Re unacceptable questions There s a bit in the sidebar that feminism supporting questions should be in r Feminism but questioning or criticising feminism should be here It s really that that caused me to ask in the first place I infer  safe place for difficult questions from that  The thread that had me wondering is somewhere else in r AskFeminists and I don t know about cross linking I couldn t see anything about it that caused people to dislike some other OP s question and when I asked I just got shut down so I came here I agree it s very hypothetical without that context I guess I ll never know 
Feminism,1615579822,Wow I remember curves from when I was a kid I didn t realize that was an all women s gym I will look into it Thank you 
Feminism,1615579684,It s not that they re not  acceptable  If they weren t  acceptable  I would remove them  gt I am asking a question in ask feminists The question is  why don t you like some questions   Some questions is very vague Why don t you like some foods Why don t you like some people Why don t you like some colors 
Feminism,1615579667,Not true Plenty men feel uncomfortable working out around women  but making a  men only buisiness hour is financial suicide as many of our  outspoken radical feminist sisters think this is a sign of misogyny and treat it as such I m cool with exclusionary buisness hours but it really only goes one way and it s in the favour of women almost all the time Saying  I feel like this when I work out so I need a gender exclusive gym hour can go both ways The difference is no one cares about it when it s men who bring up the issue When men try to open up their own gyms they get labelled as misogynists and get vandalized protested This happened in my home town of White Rock BC in      Do you really think men can t be self conscious or ashamed of their body or feel uncomfortable working out in front of attractive athletic women Imagine your a guy who is overweight and self conscious and you go to your local gym and all the women in there are in excellent shape Instagram model levels of fitness  You don t think men ever go through that scenario Really  I don t understand why so many fellow feminists think being a man is some golden lottery ticket to an easy go lucky life where there is no emotional turmoil Just because men don t express themselves openly due to being ridiculed for expressing emotion by men and women doesn t mean that these things don t effect them I m sure if you asked around many guys especially the ones who are a little more out of shape would be a lot more comfortable working out in male only gyms 
Feminism,1615579361,As I told you before I m not complaining and it s not about points I m asking about why some questions are acceptable I also said very clearly that it s not about what I feel should be downvoted or upvoted Would you mind not patronising me and projecting an issue about my feelings into this conversation Really it s incredibly rude  I am asking a question in ask feminists The question is  why don t you like some questions  
Feminism,1615579252,There s a good bit of  this at play     There s the sexist notion that the man should drive so a woman driving bad is clearly because she s a woman

Feminism,1615579078,Understandably so I just didn t know where it was coming from 
Feminism,1615578975,Because complaining that other people who none of us are responsible for are downvoting posts you don t think should be downvoted is an annoying thing to do 
Feminism,1615578928,   or write run on sentences  Seriously though I urge you to resist the temptation to think of men s violence against women as something that only  or primarily happens at the hands of  the psyco in central park at  am    Most women who are raped know their attacker    That means it s a much deeper problem than a few  psycos  as comforting as it might be for us  non psycos to think in such simplistic terms  The unfortunate  and horrifying truth is that  every man is capable of committing such violence and we must start by acknowledging that capacity in ourselves and resisting it with everything we have Then we can work on the guys around us  Anything less is an insult to the women we love  and  by the way should be insulting to ourselves as guys since it suggests that we re incapable of rising above such horrible behavior and selfish ignorance And finally You can ditch the absurd  in the west thing because it is also beneath you as a human being There s no difference in the morality of men in the  west compared to the  east  whatever those terms are supposed to represent in your comment Men all over the planet have a problem with patriarchal thinking and violent assumptions We need to attack it around the world including here at home 
Feminism,1615578830,That must be where the mountain hogging dudes go when the snow melts  D
Feminism,1615578542,I understand the rhetorical reason for the proposed curfew but just to think of the notion a bit deeper what do you mean by men Are binary trans men included nonbinary masc presenting queer men in general Men with disabilities  who do we exclude when we say  men  
Feminism,1615578400,This is a small subreddit even comments that get a bunch of downvotes still get responses I literally can t answer why some questions get downvoted I don t know why other people do what they do Neither does anyone else 
Feminism,1615578363,Wait the lady in this article is sexually harassing random men that s so fucked      
Feminism,1615578148,That s literally how reddit works Upvotes move comments up and downvotes move comments down  suppress It s nothing about what I feel like should be upvoted or downvoted I m asking why some questions are downvoted I don t understand why you keep responding if you don t want to consider the question The only dramatic and patronising tone and language has been from you 
Feminism,1615577930,This isn t actually difficult I asked you if you think women can rape men You babbled on about the legal definition and pretended you didn t understand what I was asking you You wanna play games call Milton Bradley 
Feminism,1615577915,well if there wasn t a negative connotation to the term  sexual in this context then women wouldn t be afraid to work out amongst other men right predatory is exactly what women are afraid of when    of rapists are men and not women it s understandable that  predatory wouldn t seem like the right term from a man s point of view but you have to see it from the opposite gender s perspective 
Feminism,1615577879,Thanks for the nasty tone It s not about the points it s about silencing the question Downvotes move comments out of visibility So why are some questions suppressed and not answered I m not complaining I m asking you a question   in a sub called ask feminists 
Feminism,1615577872,Ok but I don t understand the question Are you asking if I believe the definition is moral 
Feminism,1615577751,Dude it s fucking downvotes It s fake internet points who gives a shit
Feminism,1615577655,Advising someone to stay in and instituting a curfew are not comparable Which isn t to suggest that the people saying that women should stay indoors are justified but it s not the same thing 
Feminism,1615577604,Generally when this is proposed it s meant to illustrate the ridiculousness of people telling women to just stay inside or not go out after dark to avoid being the victims of violent crime 
Feminism,1615577594,My original statement was  in UK law only penetration with a penis is rape     is that the bit you take issue with 
Feminism,1615577550,What do you mean It is the actual legal definition I am using the word as it is defined 
Feminism,1615577540,So by that logic thinking masculinity is bad as a man is a sign of internalized misandry I m just playing devils advocate here but I see a lot of generalizations made that if done the other way would be taken as very misogynistic 
Feminism,1615577470,I didn t ask you for the legal definition I asked YOU for what YOU are saying Do you think this  legal definition is accurate and correct 
Feminism,1615577417,I m not a fan of the  predatory term but I understand you are talking about being sexualized If this helps women getting comfortable it is good then 
Feminism,1615577415,I ve seen women respond to dick picks with strap on pics or pics of other men s dicks though as a way of responding to a threatening message with a threat of their own  It does seem like  receiving penetrative sex is perceived as threatening in a way that non penetrative sex or  giving penetrative sex just isn t  There are various kinds of rape and sexual assault but penetrative rape seems to cause more visceral fear  and it s often treated differently under the law  
Feminism,1615577327,Can you provide a citation that suggests that the curfew was proposed in earnest good faith and not as a rhetorical device 
Feminism,1615577314,Is it possible you ve missed the point here The suggestion was intended to make you outraged and then think about how outrageous it is that we expect women to stay in after dark lest they be raped and or murdered 
Feminism,1615577260, gt And I didn t said that the idea that femininity is bad did originate with feminists  the person i responded to did so this kind of is entirely beside the point of my comment s context
Feminism,1615577244,The statement was made for the exact purpose that it was made for highlight that when men are told to stay inside a huge fuss is created over this while it is normalized to say to female femme victims to just stay inside 
Feminism,1615577225,It is not my  stance  It is the legal definition of rape in the United Kingdom Rape is penetration by the penis of mouth anus or vagina Penetration of the body by anything other than a penis is legally  sexual assault by penetration  See here  
Feminism,1615577180,I mean obviously not but when this is  proposed it s directly in response to women being told they shouldn t go out for their own safety from   men So yes if the choice is between women having a curfew to keep us safe and men having a curfew my vote is for a curfew on men 
Feminism,1615577156,We get a lot of people posting gotcha s here Like   hourly  Sorry that offends you but my skepticism is warranted by experience 
Feminism,1615577020,If your stance is that women cannot rape men you are not welcome to make top level comments here Please clarify this statement immediately 
Feminism,1615576840,That would be quite the infringement on their civil rights don t you think 
Feminism,1615576789,In UK law only penetration with a penis is rape Females can sexually assault but not commit rape 
Feminism,1615576695,Curves was a big one back in the day  are they still around 
Feminism,1615576595,I cannot answer that for you This is Reddit and people often prefer to vote rather than participate But nobody is being  hostile  
Feminism,1615576532,Both that question and my question are downvoted and quite quickly I thought the point of the sub was to ask the difficult questions which wouldn t be acceptable elsewhere So why are these questions downvoted 
Feminism,1615576386,I posted a similar question once but about the traits we found attractive If we can agree that these preferences are caused or at least influenced by patriarchy should we strive to  fix and eradicate them  However at the same time choice is still a non negotiable tenet of feminism And your choice is your choice alone I think there s no clear cut answer whether it s simply your preferences or you were  brainwashed by the patriarchy into having these likes  and dislikes  You can really apply this logic to a lot of things such as liking makeup or wanting to be a stay at home mom  But it is important to at least examine where these preferences come from Maybe it IS caused influenced by patriarchy but the question is whether you should get rid of it or not As basic and cliche of an answer it is I think as long as you re still genuinely happy with your decisions you re not hurting or forcing anyone to align with your preferences and fully support the reversal of these roles then you re okay 
Feminism,1615576291,I ve never felt weird at a gym with men so for me personally it doesn t feel necessary but I have heard about creeps so maybe my experience isn t everyone else s
Feminism,1615576283,Not in a predatory way  But I haven t experienced any judgement in my gym in over  years yet Most aren t in the position to judge anyway  D It s not an Instagram gym Just women in old ugly clothes doing stuff 
Feminism,1615576070,I can t because I don t know what you re using to browse Reddit There is a search bar usually somewhere in the upper right hand corner 
Feminism,1615576050,And even then you don t need a penis to penetrate someone s body 
Feminism,1615575966,I m sorry but could you explain to me where I go to do this I m not that familiar with the whole side bar thingy

Feminism,1615575904,He was absolutely a father figure even if he wasn t technically her father He admits to being at Mia s place from very early morning until the kids went to sleep almost everyday Being around someone for that amount of time makes it impossible for no fatherly relationship to develop Daisy even agrees and has made statements about the kids seeing Woody as their father figure

Feminism,1615575635,Ugh people who do this are the  worst  Like no dude putting your cell phone down on a machine and then going over to do something else is not gonna fly I m moving your phone sorry 
Feminism,1615575584,As I guy I almost wish I could go to a women only gym so there wouldn t be weirdly competitive men trying to claim multiple machines weights benches all at the same time  Gotta admit I ve never seen a woman do this 
Feminism,1615575551,It is definitely NOT okay If we women demand to exist and be treated equally as men we should demand it in every context  Segregation of the sexes in public spaces is dangerous and only reinforces sexual discrimination   Where I m from   such attempts of segregation are seen as dangerous Islamist interventions It s quite regressive not being able to share the same space with men There is harassment in the universities as well does that mean we should have separate universities too  Harassment is everywhere It is the harassment that should be not us  This paper explains a lot   
Feminism,1615575124,There is a women s only gym I would love to go there 
Feminism,1615575122,I never disagreed that men are as a whole more dangerous to women Rather I disagreed with that being the causality for men generally responding positively with being sexually harassed I m still rather curious as to what you see as being a biological causality 
Feminism,1615575059,She clearly has not read Lolita or if she has she missed the entire point of the book 
Feminism,1615596167,make sure to analyze yourself and your actions to uncover unintentional misoginy or machismo that s the first step anyways
Feminism,1615596057,Change my viewpoint On feminism The movement that afforded me most of the rights I have as a women in America and continues to fight for my personhood  Yeah no Misogyny is gonna have a really hard time convincing me I m worth less because I m a woman      
Feminism,1615595817,Yeah and nothing in my post history is non feminist I have never said anything non feminist I have just challenged anti male rhetoric Apparently you can t tell the difference between the two Sorry I forgot this was an echo chamber where everyone likes to pretend we are helpless victims and men are just gawking slathering rapists  instead of actually addressing real issues of gender inequality 
Feminism,1615595797,I haven t been here long but I really haven t seen any questions like that I have seen plenty of good answers that have expanded my understanding of feminism but questions Nah 
Feminism,1615595704,What I want to know is if  allmen is okay is  allwhitepeople and  allable bodiedpeople ok too 
Feminism,1615595468,Yeah you re right I m just scared he might never want to put in that effort for personal growth
Feminism,1615595209, gt  Things like  ladies nights at bars is not It s less of a  here s a safe space for women and more  women are the product we re selling  Wait do you mean a ladies night like  ladies get drink specials or  this is a night block of time where only ladies show up  I agree with you for the former  and aren t sure I ve ever seen the latter  but it s also different from what the OP is talking about  which is more in line with the latter if it exists  
Feminism,1615595189,I agree but also I m worried if I were to directly ask him these questions he might subconsciously answer the way he thinks I ll approve and not how he genuinely thinks
Feminism,1615594968,i think its a good idea but id rather them just check people prior to joinging
Feminism,1615594861,I don t understand why you think your experience is fact while everyone else s is just  anecdotal evidence  You are also not the only person who has ever worked in a gym  People don t report sexual harassment a lot of the time It s ridiculous to think that the only time it happens is when someone brings the issue to HR  Also side note isn t HR supposed to help the company deal with issues between employees not the customers  I was an instructor at a gym for years I knew a lot of women who would say things like  oh don t go into the weight room right now that one guy is there who always comments on womens butts or  that new guy keeps following me around the gym or  you know the guy that always wears the orange shorts he keeps making creepy comments when I squats  These things happen all the time and don t get reported for various reasons Maybe the woman is afraid of retaliation Maybe she s scared that she won t be believed Will they want proof Is the staff safe to confide in I was even told by the front desk guy that he wanted to watch me swim naked did I report it No I just kept my distance I m shy and hate confrontation  I m sick of the  It s not my experience so it can t be true mindset Also this isn t to say men don t have  insecurities or other problems just that there is a legitimate reason gyms decide to have a safe place for women whether you see it or not 
Feminism,1615594843,either way would work without putting a strain on our relationship Once I got his response I would likely just tell him it was a test and he would understand
Feminism,1615594605,More people get robbed than raped but nobody has proposed a curfew because there are thieves among us Where are the  I hate all men Twitter posts because it s mostly men that engage in theft    Funny how there are no millions of theft victims walking around permanently traumatized and venting their   metoo stories and hatred of men all over social media   Men have been to war where they died by the hundreds of thousands for Christ sake and if they came back and said  I hate all so and so of some nationality or race it would rightly be regarded as racist profiling or xenophobia In fact it is regarded as profiling when it comes to Japanese detention camps as it rightly should But feminists profile an entire gender and it s  activism  
Feminism,1615594590,She could just ask his opinion It can put a strain on a relationship knowing that the other party would rather misrepresent themselves than trust you to give an honest answer to a question 
Feminism,1615594526,That s less a theory and more an observation without an explanation for the perceived differences and the explanation is the interesting part Why do you think men and women view these things differently Do you think it s biological  iffy  or do you think there are social dynamics that cause men and women to react differently to the same or similar events relating to sexuality 
Feminism,1615594478,No they wouldn t These Men believe that they woukd be fine with harassment and catcalling but are the same ones that gag at the idea of dating an unattractive woman  happened to me twice or cannot be in a room with a gay man from fear of being harassed 
Feminism,1615594473, gt This attitude doesn t help our cause and is why many serious issues effecting women get sidelined What do you mean  our cause  You re clearly an anti feminist doing a shitty job of pretending to be a feminist to stir shit up You know we can see your post history yeah 
Feminism,1615594266,does OP what an honest knowing of his true thoughts or not 
Feminism,1615594195,Muslims aren t the group in power while men are Men set the standards in politics law moral and ethics in our society Muslims don t Also there are far more men who rape or justify rape than muslims who flew into the towers And those weren t even doing it because they re Muslims but because they were at war with the USA It s just ridiculous to compare this 
Feminism,1615593901,I don t know how to say I don t see why without being extremely ignorant or quite provocative   Let me try this i think they re saying  it s obviously unreasonable to label Muslims based on      there s a parallel with labelling  men based on rapists  I might be missing their intended point of course but if my understanding is about right what s the ignorant provocative bit 
Feminism,1615593879,Because a lot of men dont really see women as truly human but as an inferior being So we must be worse than them at everything 
Feminism,1615593534,To me it does The question is either extremely ignorant or quite provocative 
Feminism,1615593356,Somebody literally asked that a few hours ago please scroll through the sub 
Feminism,1615593313,We are not having a conversation about   kill all men again please use the search bar 
Feminism,1615593045,Don t be disingenuous Saying that is obviously implying that the information is somehow relevant i e you believe the law has some bearing on whether women can or cannot rape men  and unless you re being intentionally misleading you re implying you agree with the law 
Feminism,1615592949,I think it s a great idea Women need to be able to have some space to themselves and honestly some guys really mess it up I m thinking of places like gyms and dance clubs not banks or malls 
Feminism,1615592915, gt Was it a case of the truth being spoken loudly and people falling in line or was it a century of slow progress of making allies  first and foremost among women as we still to this day have nearly half of women vote contrary to feminist interests by communicating ideas For at least three hundred years whenever women have spoken about gender oppression regardless of what they re saying what tone they use how frank or soft their rhetoric is they are always cast as making too much out of nothing as using a too violent discourse of already having equality and now wanting superiority  I m not kidding I can show you   th century of men saying that there  used to be gender oppression but not anymore  Here s an example In the English speaking West one of the most respectful postures one can take is to kneel You can count this as the upper limits of  soft   non aggressive   inviting rhetoric Yet kneeling was somehow transformed into and talked about as a  thuggish disrespectful act The point is that there is no version of  inviting rhetoric that will ever win against people who actively want to deny the realities  the truth of injustice  gt And frankly how do you know this to be THE truth A truth even Anyone who looks can see the truth of injustice If you can t look you can listen If you can t listen you can feel it 
Feminism,1615592908,pretend you have a sexist view and propose it to your friend for example  lol look at this chick with an onlyfans what a whore  and see his reaction I hope you come up with something more clever than that lol but that s all i could think of on the fly
Feminism,1615592860,I can confirm from my required weights class since I played water polo women girls don t do this We were competitive at times but we waited when we wanted to do an exercise or started another to stall for time and we d say  hey I m go next lmk when you re done 
Feminism,1615592625,Women are followed and assaulted and verbally harassed by men who are in fact predatory I know this behavior isn t as easily noticed when you aren t a victim of it but predatory is the only accurate word for it It s creepy and animalistic in nature Not because we re naturally like this but because this is the only way these men know to approach women because they tend to see us as game or an end goal 
Feminism,1615592612,The part of the conversation missing here as women are told to be wary of violence is the subtext that men hear which is  You are violent   On top of carelessness men are more likely to be involved in violence from strangers because they are likely to instigate violence 
Feminism,1615592311,I ve found it s goes better to direct men who want to change behavior to resources like articles and books and let them know I m there to answer any questions as best I can You re not really in charge of his personal growth and if he wants to change he needs to put in that effort not you 
Feminism,1615592232,I have performed examples of this I own a company that produces events and I ll do an annual dance party on a yacht One time I did a ladies only one South Asians are my target demographic and the ladies really appreciated a safe space to go to Many are immigrants and having a place to be around without men once or twice a year was invigorating for them It s nothing I could sustainably do for all of my events but I think it could work Doing it in a bar is hard  will all bar staff and Dj or other entertainment be women It has its pitfalls in logistics too
Feminism,1615591129,What does the truth having to be spoken have to do with my statements the one I was responding to or the overarcing thread topic In addition while you are lumping me in with those who are unconvincable  for hyperbole I know  I assume you are familiar with the progress that has been made and will be made by the feminist movement Was it a case of the truth being spoken loudly and people falling in line or was it a century of slow progress of making allies  first and foremost among women as we still to this day have nearly half of women vote contrary to feminist interests by communicating ideas And frankly how do you know this to be THE truth A truth even Even within feminism there is little agreement on what constitutes a woman a man or anything in between or around There does not seem to be much of an agreement in regards to the role if any of non women in the movement How come it is so TRUE that anyone who does not take part in violence against women is allowing it Or is posting on Insta Twitter and FB enough activism that it counts In that case I am actively working against violence against people in general by the way Yay for the good guys 
Feminism,1615590439,No but they do touch on other reasons why women are uncomfortable with dick pics that do not apply to gay men 
Feminism,1615590069,I don t see other comments talking about gay men and dick pics
Feminism,1615589940,I think other top level comments addressed this much better than mine and are more comprehensive in general I d rather point people to those 
Feminism,1615589838,What about pictures from women that don t fit their narrow definition of beauty Would they still value vagina picts 
Feminism,1615589770,This question seems like it s flirting with transphobia Mind clarifying 
Feminism,1615589612,Hm I have a theory about this I know a few men who usually say that women are  bad drivers and I have found that they tend to think that a  good driver is one who can maneuver with both accuracy and speed Whereas most women I know tend to think that a  good driver is one who drives carefully and safely So when a woman is driving carefully and safely she might be overly cautious and maybe she won t speed much which is  bad driving in the eyes of some men who think the epitome of good driving can be found in the Fast and Furious movies  Incidentally that s probably why most car accidents caused by women are non fatal 
Feminism,1615589555,No It makes no sense the law I mean  peoole have been sexually assaulted before  pm
Feminism,1615589528,What about gay men being sent unsolicited dick pics Because if you look at gay dating apps that happens all the time I think there was another study that showed that gay men enjoy those in the same way straight men enjoyed vag pics as described by OP

Feminism,1615588505,Why shouldn t girls and women be encouraged in STEM Of course there are many sexist issues to fix in STEM education and careers However STEM just like any other interest should be equally promoted to everyone  Science and technology are also interests There are STEM adjacent hobbies too By gendering STEM interests we are contributing to an oppressive system STEM interests are still heavily gendered and we need to break this norm   That being said there is also work need to make these places equally accessible to everyone  Girls and women often leave STEM because of hostility towards them    Encouraging  women and girls is not going to fix the oppression system in STEM workplaces or schools however it will break the norm of gendering interest in STEM 
Feminism,1615587910,Thank you so much I ll look deeper into this it looks really helpful 
Feminism,1615587744,Sorry I do agree with the original comment in that American actors are way more glam than British men but the specific post is about men IN RELATION to their female counterparts None of the actors you mentioned have ever been paired with a stereotypically  ugly actress whereas stereotypically  ugly actors are often paired with attractive actresses in American media Not selection bias to note this

Feminism,1615586973,I think a lot of this is dependant on if they let others in There are ladies only a lot of things that can  be a more comfortable and exclusive place But the thing about that sort of deal is it s only for a certain time Trans people should be included should they want to go and if men want to have a men night then they should get to do that to 
Feminism,1615586689,The entitlement is palpable If you re uncomfortable with people who literally haven t done anything due to their sex alone that s your problem It s as ridiculous as wanting whites only facilities because you don t like black people 
Feminism,1615586204,Side rant I think we need to find a way to be comfortable talking about behaviors even if there is an ethnic component to it Acknowledging a particular undesirable behavior happens more often in minority communities than in white communities doesn t need to be seen as confirming racist ideology It doesn t mean that those behaviors are genetic or otherwise inherent to ethnic minorities A lot of it is tied to a legacy of poverty more than anything else I m Afro Latina I can definitely say that there is more fear involved with walking alone ethnically diverse neighborhoods because those are the neighborhoods where I experience street harassment I can t even count the number of times that I ve been followed while walking alone I have not had that experience in white majority communities and I doubt that that pattern is unique to me IMOP the key to not being racist about it is understanding that the present higher prevalence of those behaviors doesn t mean that black and Hispanic men are inherently more sexist  You don t solve racism by pretending that these problems don t exist When you do pretend the problem isn t there it s not just the white hipster s fear that you re dismissing You re also dismissing the minority women who live in those neighborhoods and have a higher rate of victimization than suburban women

Feminism,1615585281,Systemic  Adjective relating to or noting a policy practice or set of beliefs that has been established as normative or customary throughout a political social or economic system That definition is EXACTLY what systemic means You re entire premise is based off of anecdotal evidence  and just some over demonization of men  I m telling you from working in a gym as an Hr rep for   years and investigating MULTIPLE accusations of harassment over the years that your perception of the norm is patently false  Your examples of blatant gawking staring or being perversely persistent to the point of harassment ARE NOT THE NORM Like I said in my   years as a gym professional I have encountered this legitimately happening to the point where intervention was needed only twice I have investigated over   claims however  You say  most women don t complain when men say hello and this is true But more women complain when men say an innocuous hello then men being overtly predatory and   Creepy And  from what I ve seen when those individuals surface it s MEN who come to the ladies defence  and the perpetrator in question gets lifetime banned from the gym  You don t seem to understand that how you feel and what you perceive isn t necessarily the objective truth  We had a woman complaining about a man staring at her and the guy in question was blind He stares at literally EVERYTHING   In her opinion  Her form was dangerously off We investigated the claim we have CCTV in every part of the gym except inside the change rooms She was doing a deadlift far above her safe weight with unsafe form The guy said to her  listen I m not trying to intrude but your form is dangerously wrong and you might hurt yourself  If you don t think there is any advantage to being a woman at the gym then you don t spend much time there We have workout programs specifically catered to female forms Spin yoga thai bo tai chi etc etc And while these classes arent inherently exclusive to men they are specifically catered to target areas which women are trying to target ass legs lower back waist  etc etc  And they are free with membership  To get the same classes that cater to men s ideal workout you have to pay extra  at least in my gym  Things like fighters class boxing powerlifting classes or high intensity CrossFit  We also get full access during norma hours and we get special hours just for us If you want to pretend we don t have a clear advantage then I won t stop you  But a woman going full time to my gym would get     more hours to work out a week and more accessible free classes that she is interested in
Feminism,1615585256,What is gender culture   If you are referring to conventional gender roles and norms  feminism has long been critiquing normative femininity and masculinity  including through the constructs of internalised misogyny and concepts such as the patriarchal bargain    There is no clear separation between sex and normative gender either in that sexing the body to decide what norms should be applicable is gender Further practises that come to be associated with sexes still are capable of acquiring status conferring status on the people associated with those practises

Feminism,1615584769,I have also worked in a gym for years and have been pretty blatantly sexually harassed while working out However I m not saying it happens constantly just that the fear of being ogled or harassed is definitely one of the reasons women are uncomfortable Plus the physical strength size difference between the average man and woman is a real issue when it comes to safety especially in the eyes of a lot of women Those are the main reasons there are women only times and there aren t for men I m not saying that women aren t self conscious just that there is an extra layer to it

Feminism,1615584340,You are seriously reaching    This is a thread about  female only times at a gym and I am just saying why it would be preferable from my own experience If I was to go into a sauna I would feel more comfortable with other women as the one s at my gym are always full of men who obviously have a right to be there but it makes me feel uncomfortable to go into a confined space with multiple men who are strangers to me whilst wearing a bathing suit I can t relax or enjoy a facility like that I am not saying the men are going to rape me  seriously      where did you get that from   But that I would appreciate a women s only time slot 
Feminism,1615584177,To be fair it was really more of a case by case thing It only happened in one instance but honestly if women feel uncomfortable working out around men a trans man isn t necessarily excluded from that It s definitely complicated and one of the reasons I switched to a gym that was more inclusive overall 
Feminism,1615584171,What do you mean by  not understanding feminist views  Do you mean that I don t inherently prescribe myself as a victim and men as perpetrators based on our sex That I recognize that being a woman has advantages that men don t enjoy Because so far that s the only thing I have arguments against  Feminism claims to be about equality yet if someone points out an inequality that works in women s favour they get labelled as  non feminist   Is that how the movement works now Exclude anyone who doesn t subscribe to the echo chamber status quo of  poor me im just a silly weak woman  Or do you mean not subscribing to the notion that being born male inherently gives you an easy life Well I have two sons a daughter and have witnessed how I am treated compared to how my husband is treated and how my sons are treated compared to my daughter and myself Believe it or not it works both ways And up until maybe   years ago I would say it favoured men much more then women but that simply isn t the case today   I thought feminism was about gender equality of opportunity and calling out systemic discrimination that effects both genders  Recognizing the litany of advantages being female gives me  and you can t pretend there aren t any doesn t make me any less feminist than you   Yes being female also comes with a litany of disadvantages too just like being male comes with both as well  The difference is I don t inherently give myself victimhood status or demonize men by default  It seems that you are regurgitating third wave feminist rhetoric and have never actually tried to empathize with the reality of what it is like being a man in our culture and the blatant systemic and cultural advantages women do have you explain away  or even better blame men for

Feminism,1615607596,I don t necessarily think tampons should be free  at least not in the context of capitalism  I think they should be possible to obtain for free in some circumstances and settings and low cost otherwise just as condoms and toilet paper are Not having access to them is a health risk  and also limits the ability of women and girls  and trans guys NB folks who menstruate to participate in economic and social life It s also a cost that only people who menstruate have to bear and depending on an individual s cycle and budget that cost can be considerable I would like to see  single servings of basic models available for free in public institution restrooms like toilet paper and packs available for on request in particular circumstances like at schools universities food banks etc a bit like condoms 
Feminism,1615607018,I m from South America were tampon use is not widely extended amongst teenage and the most vulnerable women population But just as  RisingQueenx said poverty is the main reason why I think in my country s case period pads should be given for free to girls and menstruating women as has been said just like toilet paper soap and potable water is accessible for free in first world countries I recall during my early teens we used to ask amongst us classmates when we were on an emergency if anyone has a spare pad to give us We always share When you are a   year old girl in a Latin American country back in the early    s it was kind of taboo unfortunately We asked our teacher to had an emergency pack for those cases  I wonder about girls in places even less fortunate than us like some places in India  I recall the short film  Period End of sentence   and the middle East or some countries in South East Asia I think all menstruating women who struggle to afford their basic needs covered should get free period pads tampons  according to culture I guess  Now I know pads are damaging to environment but I hope we can come up with a solution that can be both friendly to young women s bodies and to our environment I think this should be paid by the state

Feminism,1615599052, you assign these things to  the patriarchy  which is just a round about way or saying you blame men and their oppressive ways for them It seems like a really convenient cop out anything that men are suffering from it s  the patriarchies fault Not like we as women perpetuate these cultural norms or anything right  I defined patriarchy as how it is defined in the dictionary A society that excludes women from power and disadvantages women over men in a systemic and cultural way We by definition do not fit that in the secular west I m not saying we have achieved perfect gender equality not at all But we  by definition do not live in a patriarchal society  If you need to revise the meanings of words to victimize yourself your ideology needs re examining  I don t really want to turn this into a  he vs she because if you compare the two worldwide women are still suffering more than men that cannot be denied And historically women have had their agency restricted as well But in the secular west we enjoy a litany of advantages over men and the fact that you have to ask  and are unaware of what they are shows that I was right and you haven t ever tried to empathize with men  Now this isn t to say we don t have disadvantages as well They work in different aspects  But since you asked ok You mentioned the draft Well not being drafted is a systemic law that we as women enjoy It s an advantage whether you want to blame men for it or not Our right to vote isn t predicated on the draft theirs is  You mentioned emotional unavailability Well that bleeds into my next point of male disposability Society views men s lives as expendable and women s lives as valuable Which is why we have had our agency so heavily restricted traditionally and why women have been oppressed worldwide in every culture Because if you completely objectify us it s clear that we are a valuable resource Perhaps THE most valuable The ability to give life Since men lack this ability their lives have been deemed completely expendable and this bleeds into every facet of our culture Violence against men is so normalized we never even think about it when we see it Can you name me a single movie that wasn t a horror film  because those by definition are supposed to horrify you that depicts women on the receiving end of the same kind of violence men are in The first  minutes of Saving Private Ryan Or any other of those fighting or war movies And when women are killed it s usually done off screen or in a less  excruciating manner  Female illnesses get more public awareness and funding then male Testicular prostate cancer gets    the funding breast cervical does  despite killing as many or more amounts of people  In countries states with unrestricted or highly liberal abortion laws we have more bodily autonomy Male infant circumcision an abhorrent practice is widely accepted and even perpetuated by women The circumcised penis is deemed  normal looking Female circumcision is recognized for what it is an abhorrent disgusting crime to commit against a non consenting infant  Being the presumed caregivers in divorce Insanely stacked divorce court against the non presumed caregiver which is almost always the father Especially if the father is the primary breadwinner he ends up more often then not paying for a house he doesn t get to live in and rarely if ever seeing his kids  Us Getting on average    of the sentence for the exact same crime as men Being      as likely to receive the death penalty for the exact same crime Living  years longer on average  We die at work at     the rate men do Public and post secondary education is leaving boys behind and using teaching models which have been proven to advantage women at the cost of boys This is clear in declining male education rates     of alimony is paid by men to women  Men make up    of domestic violence victims and    of non reciprocated domestic violence victims  where the victim isn t fighting back at all  yet not even   of shelters which are mostly woman run and funded accept them I dunno how you can blame that one on  patriarchy  Making up the majority of college acceptance graduates  scholarship recipients despite also making up the majority of enrolled students post secondary  Our blatant advantage in the dating market m especially if your young and pretty but being able to have companionship whenever we want it is something we take for granted And if you go further into this point it gets more blatant how much we control in dating We control sex we get to accept reject advances at our whim This may seem like a small thing but that s only because you have always had it To someone who has never had it it s invaluable  Our lives having inherent value by the nature of our birth See my point about male disposability  Being presumed the non aggressor in any confrontation between a man and ourselves  And lastly we have a complete monopoly on reproductive rights To the point where  no matter what we choose to do reproductively  it s how it goes down and the man has no choice but to go along with it He cannot opt out of parenthood  This point is so stacked in our favour that it s actually legal to commit paternity fraud You and I as women could hypothetically cheat on our partner get pregnant bear the baby and raise it as our partners and then get found out when the child grows and not only are we not criminally liable for the child but the man we did this too is still financially responsible for a child that isn t biologically his  it s also  completely legal in all   states to not tell the man you are pregnant and keep that mans biological child away from him   Baby trapping is also completely legal in all   states To the point where a woman can actually take a mans sperm from a condom impregnate herself even though he didn t consent to unprotected sex and then hold him financially responsible for the child When sleeping with women professional athletes are told to keep their used condoms for this very reason 
Feminism,1615598981,I was referring to the  ladies drink free nights  I haven t seen what you re talking about but I d be fine with it 
Feminism,1615598372,I find your depiction of trans women s features stereotypical In most cases trans women don t meet this standard you mention in one or more ways Intuitively if they did then they wouldn t be such an easy and therefore frequent target of sexual assault 
Feminism,1615598037,Then point this worry to him Don t be scared of being assertive in your questionings and make sure to him that being uneducated about something isn t bad that you re there to help him if he wants  assuming you are  
Feminism,1615597820,A lot of the Pornhub related questions here have challenged my views towards sex work  I was initially     against the Trafficking Hub movement but people here have made me think twice  some of the  men are trash questions have made me think more about how harmful general statements can be and a few posts I have made myself got some interesting yet differing answers I feel like despite identifying strongly with feminism I ve learned from some discussions in this subreddit that the ideology has flaws but that s okay at the end of the day a lot of us have a different definition of what feminism is 
Feminism,1615597732,That changed my views about being a feminist Or changed my views on a topic inside feminism If so then probably I ve read many valuable things on here But nothing I can recall specifically 
Feminism,1615597687,It s probably more likely because humans are more socialized for killing each other  through warfare than raping Yes we consider rape a worse crime because women were long considered essentially the property of men and not to be sacrificed like men were are in war 
Feminism,1615597649,How in tf is that their space It s a gym they don t even own The women pay to use those facilities too but then get harassed by equally paying dogs Also if they really want to only use the facilities they wouldn t be staring down a woman hard and would be minding their own business But did they Nope 
Feminism,1615597450,Uhhh   Fuck Mate I m not touching that with a ten foot pole 
Feminism,1615597421,Completely understandable But I have a cousin and really likes the option of having a safe space since there s noticeable scars on their chest towards the armpit area when they transitioned He s proud of it but don t want to get harassed over it when working out which has happened a lot  I don t think a lot of gyms around us are going to have a safe time for LGBTQ individuals like ladies nights especially since we re in a conservative heavy area but we re happy that the gym we go to let s him in during that time They definitely wouldn t let him in if other ladies there during that time aren t comfortable though 
Feminism,1615597277,Absolutely Finding and undoing internalized misogyny has been one of my biggest personal goals for a while
Feminism,1615597159,Here s what I can anecdotally say as a feminist aligned man Do not treat this like a test People aren t dumb and he picks up you re testing him to make sure he s  okay  that s a sure fire way to quickly lose their trust and possibly a best friend If he says does things that you find unsavory that is a reason in itself to stop being friends with him You don t need to try prod his psyche for where he might trip up and beyond that it can all too quickly become about proving your own views on the matter and about him than actually gauging his responses  the post a few weeks ago about guys giving a friend a bunch of scenarios when he called out another shared friend s as sexual assault the the flip side version of this   Treat like a discussion and if you think he has a questionable opinion on something  provided they don t cross a personal red line for you ask him why he thinks that try to clarify misconceptions and possibly try to gently nudge him in the right directly I can say personally that most guys don t want to hurt people but we might have learned bad lessons from the authority figures and peers in our lives that need to be unlearned  which is a long process in itself  Be careful not to treat that process as like a  pet project  though I know there are guys out there who are jaded towards feminists women because someone in their past treated them like a  problem needing fixing  If you want to discuss this stuff with him you could start with using a situation involving someone you and he are emotionally connected to like  I heard saw x say   sexist comment joke   catcall someone can you believe that   or  Y had a rough night out recently there was this guy who wouldn t leave her alone even when told him to  You even use yourself use an example from your life like being catcalled or when you felt like you were being followed or something By starting a conversation that s more personal you can then transition it into a discussion of harassment and consent One thing to note with the approach though is that personal connections do colour how we treat situations and he might say one thing with a generic example but act differently if he knows the attacker victim both You could also use big cases that appear in the news like the Sarah Everard one but that can be tricky as cases that are widely spoken also see alot of hot takes and can affect a person s responses Using examples where he might have not a formed an opinion yet are useful in grasping how he processes them and how he reaches the conclusions he does Hell if you even use  I was reading this book online recently and found out that   statistic    Cold statistics help avoid possible biases and can prevent a conversation being coloured by opinions of the people involved or prior reading which can lead to him answering in a more straightforward manner As I said previously though this can mean you get a sense of how he might act hypothetically but perhaps not in reality especially if he knows someone involved I don t there s any  right way to start this conversation  its a difficult and often personal topic and you know what approach to discussion works for him better than I ever could As to examples another  do not I would avoid is anything  conventional to get the most nuanced responses That s not to say you shouldn t use them as a jumping off point but most guys are going to say they support a victim if you say  x forced themselves on y  and you aren t going to learn much from that You might get a different response if you ask them about  z taking back some out their face drunk to their place  or  z bothering this person after being told now or  a grabbed slapped b s butt without asking  or even  a and b were having sex and b didn t seem to care when a felt like they wanted to stop  Likewise with harassment its easy for guys to say  catcalling is bad  but if you make a point about how someone harassed someone and no one helped particular if its a woman who s the victim with men as bystanders you might get a different response Non conventional scenarios make us question how we would react in those scenarios and often result in us understanding and verbalising our own views in a manner that more solid that just  sexual harassment assault is bad  I would also use a mix of genders People can and do act differently if it s  he on she vs  she on he  or  she on she vs  he on he  or with gender non conforming people   he she on they   etc I would try to insert these naturally as how he reacts to them will also give you an inkling into his views on gender stereotypes and LGBT people alongside his opinions of harassment and consent One thing I would also suggest possibly doing  but be careful in how you word it is ask if anyone in their life had ignored their consent or overstepped a boundary I know one of the most frank discussions I ve ever had with male friends is one guy saying  this girl in the club last week kept touching me and was being a bitch when I told to go away  not saying that s the best way he could of said just that s how he described it  I brought up how I d had guys grope me before similarly and said what they did was sexual harassment and even assault They all then came out with stories of men and women overstepping boundaries and coming the brutal realisation that  oh we ve all be sexually harassed or assaulted here  It was eye opening experience for all of us I would avoid alot of caution here though as it could lead to re living a traumatic experience they didn t want to talk about Sorry for the long comment hope anything I said can help 
Feminism,1615597106,capitalism also profits off of this and mostly men control the industries and have the most power so of course they wouldn t want to give up their privilege also the amount of people that don t realize they are sexist and misogynistic since its so normalized
Feminism,1615597096,I dont think they should exist Unless theres a mens only hour That just seems fair 
Feminism,1615597067,And when women don t wear makeup people comment on it either negative like or say something backhanded
Feminism,1615597055,There are plenty of good questions and many that help me refine my position but none that have outright rocked my world 
Feminism,1615596847,not all black people is used to fight a fake narrative that white people created black people are savage uneducated and shit to appear superior and justify their abuse and those stereotypes affect them even this days so a marginalized group fighting opression vs not all men that is used to silence women that speak on their struggles in society and changing the subject so the opressor silencing the opressed
Feminism,1615596562,in society there is a different treatmen to women an men women cant go out without being catcalled they get used to make products more desirable etc while men dont get that now that is important because it causes girls to get a huge ammount of attention because of how much they are viewed as objects and they cant leave that on the contrary men almost never get complimented or called beautiful because its deemed as unimportant to them that causes boys to generally like getting that  sexy object gets attention and thats also a problem on the catcalling thing because mens desire to be praised makes them think id like to get whistles on the street so they dont listen to women but this perception of men being desperate for sex and shit is also a problem bcs it makes people think men cant be sexually abused or that they should be grateful
Feminism,1615596483,Again even in America suffrage was restricted to most men like it was in other parts of the world Feminist simply want to rewrite history on this point to came a false oppression narrative Even today in some parts of the world men s civil rights are conditional on them signing up to fight in military combat Women never had similar obligations
Feminism,1615596171,Can I just ask a relevant question If we agree that men in general don t feel bothered as much as women with unoslicited nudes does that mean there  should be a double standard here In general should the discouragement we give towards men sending unsolicited nudes be  higher than to women sending unsolicited nudes 
Feminism,1615631007,Female animals are breeding machines until they re no longer  productive at which point they re slaughtered for low quality meat Cows have their babies taken away so we can use their milk instead Sows spend the majority of their lives in crates too small to even turn around in I know multiple feminists who are vegan for these reasons The only question is whether feminism extends to non human females and I m not knowledgeable enough to answer that 
Feminism,1615630967, gt I don t use or need supplements Without even supplements like B   Getting anywhere near    gram of protein per lb of bodyweight let alone  g of protein per lb of bodyweight of bodyweight seems like an impossibility with a vegan diet  gt Veganism is slightly more expensive than vegetarianism  because vegan milk is more expensive than cows milk but for me it hasn t been more expensive than eating meat It s probably been roughly the same cost for me eating vegan and eating meat Don t the extra veggies and stuff like almond milk or soy milk cost a lot Maybe then it depends where you live ig  gt Good thing I didn t say that then Wasn t talking about you specifically I know you didn t say that and that s nice But however there are some people who say things like that 
Feminism,1615630698, gt It feels like you re just trying to be victimised here I don t think so I m talking about other people who say stuff like that not the person that I replied to 
Feminism,1615630563,You literally said this  gt Personally I believe that this discourse the generalisation of men as a whole creates quite a dangerous and hostile ideology concerning the nature of men We are not all bad people and those that are it is not solely due to the fact they are male it is also due to the fact they are perverse individuals that often manipulate their physical advantages over women to gain power and dominance Talking all about the generalization of men and how all of you aren t bad people It s a typical   NotAllMen which is done to dismiss the struggles of women and to derail conversations like when it s about sexual assualt or the attitudes that men have over women as a whole and then derailing that conversation to make it everything about men rather than what women go through and reflecting on your attitudes 
Feminism,1615630116, gt all those supplements I don t use or need supplements I am not rich  I originally went vegetarian because I was broke and couldn t afford meat  Veganism is slightly more expensive than vegetarianism  because vegan milk is more expensive than cows milk but for me it hasn t been more expensive than eating meat It s probably been roughly the same cost for me eating vegan and eating meat   gt saying something like that you need to be a vegan to be a feminist sounds exclusionary Good thing I didn t say that then 
Feminism,1615629904, gt Now I m not going to attack people s feminism just because they are not vegan  gt I fully respect your choice to follow a vegan diet but saying something like that you need to be a vegan to be a feminist sounds exclusionary It feels like you re just trying to be victimised here
Feminism,1615629570,Yeah that s nice Vegan diet is not possible for everybody especially if you re not rich and be able to afford all those supplements but ofcourse people should have to freedom to able to eat whatever they want therefore also a vegan diet and I fully respect your choice to follow a vegan diet but saying something like that you need to be a vegan to be a feminist sounds exclusionary I want to be able to eat steak without the fear of getting lynched and also fully support the rights and liberation of women and therefore strongly oppose the patriarchy I don t see how they are mutually exclusive In the context of my country vegetarianism is often used to justify excluding people from usually marginalized groups from places like housing and to exert their sense of supremacy over others So looking at this further makes me dislike this imposed vegetarianism 
Feminism,1615629470,Do you mean how women say women should act and how men say men should act Because that s a pretty big spectrum right there 
Feminism,1615629293,Double standards aren t a good thing They ve brought about a lot of issues throughout history Especially in the face of women wanting jobs the right to vote and the right to have equality in all aspects of their life Which we STILL have issues with If anything I wished that they had never existed 
Feminism,1615629164,Not necessarily Veganism is economically infeasible and one has to be quite wealthy to get adequate nutrition from a vegan diet In fact Gujarat and Rajasthan  the most vegetarian states in India have the highest malnutrition and anaemia rates which affects the poorest the most and to be frank it is antithetical to the main aims of feminism for we don t want people to be discriminated on account of their gender either individually or systematically and veganism will merely enfeeble the poor 
Feminism,1615629148,A majority of men hold roles like police officers and security guards It s all a system of who is in which position And if someone is arguing that women who speak out against sexual assault are trying to ask for men s protection they re quite literally speaking out and making others more aware of what s going on Hopefully putting that particular person who committed the act behind bars It might also be good to bring up if men were to be sexually assaulted you hope that they go to the same length to protect themselves As they face entirely different obstacles 
Feminism,1615628942,For some people yes for others no The general consensus is treat living creatures with dignity and respect Which is a huge issue in the meat processing industry 
Feminism,1615628913,That person does not represent the sub s views You re falling into confirmation bias 
Feminism,1615628790,A double standard is conceptually understood as a bad thing isn t it It s not just treating people differently for similar situations Juvenile courts for example seem to be good thing even though their purpose is to treat people differently based on their age 
Feminism,1615628597,I work as a doctor and I love having some of the more difficult questions that are going to be asked beforehand Even though it is tempting to blame it on anxiety or stress or whatever seems to be the smartest solution I try my very best to always be honest about the things I do not know However that leads to the following problem usually If I don t know the questions that will be asked and then don t know the answer to the question I usually don t have the time to look it up or consult with more experienced colleagues during the booked hour So then I have to tell the patient that I will be reaching out later or tell them my findings in a next session If I had the questions beforehand then I could answer quicker better and more prepared So great way of doing that smart idea 
Feminism,1615628321,Take this for example Knife crime in London in the past couple of decades has been on the rise and the main perpetrators of these crimes have been black males So if I said that I fear black men when I walk around London because they might stab me what is the difference between that and what women say about men in general Men are the victims of violent crimes more often than women and therefore I have the right to be scared of knife crime  but does that also give me the right to make comments about black people that are the main perpetrators of such crimes in London Or on the other said there are men that often generalise all women due to the relationships they have had with women in the past Take for example the popularity of Juice Wrlds  all girls are the same or whatever It s fine for these men to have a mistrust of women in a romantic sense but is it fair for people like juice world to make songs that state all women are manipulative and emotionally immature 
Feminism,1615628196,Why does this sub seem like a such a battlefield for so many people People ask  admittedly simple and sometime dumb questions about Feminism  and hope to get a civil and intelligent answer It s not their fault for trying to learn more and ask questions 
Feminism,1615628031,Like I ve said in my post I m not trying to victimise men and I understand why women have a fear of men in general My issue is when you guys talk about men you don t merely generalise the threatening nature of men These comments often lead into others comments about men in relation to their opinions intellectual capacity appearance etc In what way is this rhetoric a rhetoric that aims to raise awareness about female victims through persecuting men as a whole useful 
Feminism,1615628027,So even though we want to be strong and independent men are still the ones with the majority of the power then when we require help from those in privileged positions we re deemed as not being feminist enough Put more women in power and we will rather ask them for help instead of the only people with the ability to help us  men   Don t even bother arguing against questions like that the men asking them won t care about the truth 
Feminism,1615627856,But the thing is I haven t said  not all men  I ve said the language feminists use can give the impression that they mean all men as was the case in things like the ACAB movement which can create dangerous and damaging opinions and relationships Responses like this do not help in this discussion whatsoever 
Feminism,1615627792,As long as you re examining the morals of either approach they do go hand in hand yes Don t abuse animals don t abuse women Technically you can be one without the other of course but you should definitely be both 
Feminism,1615627736,You are just hating on men not complaining about genuine issues at all People like you just make it harder for our cause to be taken seriously 
Feminism,1615627692,Nope you re not allowed to be toxic And also no you don t get to make decisions with regards to how I live myself 
Feminism,1615627615,Rape happens to men too but unfortunately  in my country men are the perpetrators of rape against men and women Men literally get laughed at when trying to report rape to the police while male on female rape isn t taken seriously enough male on male rape is taken even less seriously     Your sexism does not help the feminist cause at all Please rethink your prejudices you are only hurting us females by spreading incorrect information 
Feminism,1615627482,So I d argue that yes it is better to be both a feminist and a vegan I understand going vegan is going to varied levels of difficulty for different people and very many people will not be able to go full vegan any time soon I would say that the end goal should be veganism with a sense of  I ll still eat x and y because z for parts that are too hard I m basically just asking people to try their best  Now I m not going to attack people s feminism just because they are not vegan I tend to treat these things separately since it is just easier that way But for me I am vegan and feminist and a socialist and in support of BLM and in support of disability rights and LGBTQ rights for all the same reasons they seemed to be morally correct things to do 
Feminism,1615626565,You don t have to pander to anyone  I was looking more at the stereotype that Feminists hate men  which I do not think is true Then I see comments like this Reading about these men who are apparently  inconsiderate animals is not a great look 
Feminism,1615626431,I was already on my way becoming more socialist but discussions in this sub have really articulated arguments against capitalism really well For example of course I was aware of the unpaid labor that women do but simply put a society that doesn t pay women to bear children is inherently patriarchal Even with paid maternity leave from employers we are still miles away from fully compensating women for unpaid labor In other words I knew capitalism was problematic before but now I believe capitalism is inherently incompatible with feminism 
Feminism,1615626245,You don t know me and you haven t a clue what I do and what I don t in my private life Stop assuming things about me please  I saw bullshit I called the person out No being a woman or a victim doesn t give you a license to be a scumbag 
Feminism,1615625952,At my university there were some vegans that argued that animal agriculture exploits female animals  ex cows milk so not supporting that industry is feminist And on the flip side people who eat animal products are supporting the exploitation of female animals so they aren t good feminists  It s not a popular stance and I don t really agree with it but some people do 
Feminism,1615625479,So dissapointing how people like you come on this sub and are vehemently against  anti male sentiments  which are usually just women voicing their frustrations about mistreatment by men but are completely silent when it comes to the masses of anti women and anti feminist sentiments that are rife here and in the world 
Feminism,1615625460,I m just trying to be helpful here I ve seen a lot of people use this kind of language and it pushes people away 
Feminism,1615625212,don t you re not doing us a favour it s so exhausting to keep your rage within the boundaries of political correctness when men are ever ready to stop caring about your human rights if you offend them a little 
Feminism,1615625134,you don t need to type paragraphs out to attack my language what i wrote was an addendum to what i thought about the problem at hand not something i want op to say exactly jesus 
Feminism,1615625045,lol when a woman complains about genuine issues and you want to hyperfocus on her language maybe the problem here is your not caring about the issue to begin with 
Feminism,1615625029,I do not think this approach is effective Either they already agree with it and therefore won t change their mind at all Or they disagree in which case you push them further away Saying something like this makes it extreamly easy to be painted with the  all feminists hate men brush Optics matter If you attack someone s ideas outright they are just going to get defensive From my experience you really need to handhold people through things like this or else you can end up doing more harm than good    If you are trying to change someone s mind the words you say don t matter it s only the ones they hear if you say that what they hear is goin to be something along the lines of  Men can t be raped and all men are inconsiderate animals   Now you and I both know that s not what is being said here but that is what they will hear and that s what counts 
Feminism,1615624579, gt Things like  ladies nights at bars is not  It s less of a  here s a safe space for women and more  women are the product we re selling  Oops I would just assume these were gay 
Feminism,1615624408,Just a child throwing a tantrum is what you are  Look at me  I can insult men all I want  Fuck men they are trash      Nothing to see here just an entitled womanchild 
Feminism,1615624152,I mean I am no MRA but it s quite obvious that this sub  and some feminists in general exhibits anti cis male sentiment It s one of the primary reasons why I would never identify as a feminist but I do support women s rights nonetheless 
Feminism,1615624125,why do we have to pander to male feelings all the time i don t care enough for this 
Feminism,1615623017, gt either way would work without putting a strain on our relationship Once I got his response I would likely just tell him it was a test and he would understand Please stop dodging These are your words  what are you trying to do here 
Feminism,1615622720,So basically if someone is beating his girlfriend on the street you try to fight the guy but he pulls a knife on you and injures you but keeps beating his gf that means you ve been helping him since you did not stop violence happening in front of you 
Feminism,1615622614,Ideally double standards should never exist Every person should be treated only by how ethical they are tiwards others and not about how they look on the outside  gender race etc  The only examole that I can think off is positive discrimination  It is not ideal but it is a helpful tool to bring diserversity to certain areas like politics or science Eventually people will see that the diversity is normal and the p d wont be necessary 
Feminism,1615622562,I am repeatedly in awe of the ability of y all to handle bad faith or outright hostile  discussions   This is just the latest example and I wanted to take the opportunity to tell you that I learn just as much about feminism on this sub as I am learning about healthy reactions to unhealthy people Thank you 
Feminism,1615621769,Obviously In Turkey the government didn t suggest to segregate the sexes completely but to open a few women only universities And STILL there was a huge outrage because everyone knows it reinforces the idea that women and men cannot coexist together And in the end they stepped back  I m really amazed by how you guys in the West can t see the problem here I ve read all the comments and there is no single argument about how this would benefit feminism or bring social justice oh maybe because it wouldn t 
Feminism,1615621536, gt if men weren t inconsiderate animals to begin with That s not really a strong case for the whole Feminists don t hate men argument   Yeah I know they don t  but sheesh why are you making it so damn easy for the MRA s

Feminism,1615644413,Warning I m a class A rambler this will probably be a long one First of all the fact that you have noticed this behavior about yourself and want to change it is the best first step you can take especially impressive to have this mindset at   years old You said that your gender is irrelevant but I think it s very relevant if you experience male privilege or not in this question I will assume you do The feelings of being resentful isn t uncommon at all infact I understand it To better explain I ll give you an example where I experienced similar feelings I m white and when I was younger I would have the same feelings when people of color would explain their experiences with white people I got defensive thinking  I would never say do that My friends wouldn t either etc  I realized pretty quickly how ignorant my response was Here are these people of color who have experienced racism their entire life trying to have an discussion about racism with white people  After reading all that my response was  But I don t do that   I understand how ignorant it is for me to be angry about generalization when they re talking about such a serious topic as racism To expect oppressed groups to stop generalizing when talking about discrimination is such a non issue The reason we do this is because we don t want to take accountability I ve never discriminated against a person of color but I ve definitely done it passively By saying  Not all X  I was minimizing the issue at hand By uncomfortably laughing when someone said a racist joke or being quiet when someone said the N word like it was any other word I was teaching the people around me that it s okay to behave like that Being a man it s hard and can even be shocking to hear women s stories about men and how they may resent men  But we can t keep tip toeing around the subject of discrimination After decades of discrimination women s voices and stories about sexism weigh more than men feeling uncomfortable After discriminating women for decades it s completely nonsense to expect women to also take care of men s issues which stems from a system men created to benefit men the patriarchy There isn t a magic pill you can take to understand the female perspective of sexism The only thing you can do is listen to women and understand the power of privilege You don t have to be a superhero that crushes the patriarchy every single day nobody can do that Like I said in my example earlier if you stop allowing  passive sexism in your everyday life that s a huge step Your question is hard because personally I think you ve already figured it out You understand how you feel and you understand that your feelings are an indicator to male fragility or machoculture and you re trying to change that

Feminism,1615643149, gt I pointed out that it s fine for women to fear all men and that generalisations about men in terms of the threat they pose is fine  my point is that often these fears lead into other generalisations about the nature of men in general This is an important distinction to make and it seems that people reading these posts do not recognise this distinction The things you re saying is exactly the   NotAllMen this whole worrying about generalization of men and making it about men and derailing the conversation from the oppression of women  gt This is not a  notallmen post at all I am just concerned with people using issues concerning sexual harassment to make comments about men that are not explicitly related to sexual issues This same thing happens with race and men make the same generalisations about women as well usually in a romantic context What makes you so cocerned about this rather than the victims and what they go through And these generalizations aren t comparable due to power dynamics   gt This sort of comment that you make is what I think scares a lot of guys in this scenario You can be fearful of men in general because of the threat some pose and you can of course try to spread awareness to men about what sexual harassment is and how to prevent But you can t use sexual harassment by males as an excuse to discount men s opinions on certain topics you cannot use it to say men are intelligent and you cannot use it to say men are undeserving of certain luxuries You mean the usual men s opinions like dismissing that issue victim blaming trying their hardest to downplay those issues doing whataboutery and try to derail the conversation doing   NotAllMen Then ofcourse it s going to be dismissed 
Feminism,1615642815,See the thing is those questions have no relationship to the hypothesised assumption I have made about black people that commit knife crime in London The crime committed is different so you re not going to ask the same questions about the relationship between killer and victim whatsoever To ask questions specifically related to sexual harassment in terms of knife crime is absolutely absurd What I have done is drawn a correlation between the two Men are victims to knife crime on a scale larger than women and the dominant perpetrator of knife crime in various areas of the UK are black people Women are victims of sexual harassment on a scale larger than men and the dominant perpetrator of sexual harassment are men Hence we have two things that are the same so why is it any different to draw the same conclusions about black people as there are about men The fact that you have said it s racist also implies that the comments made against men are sexist   
Feminism,1615642718,For me personally it s all interconnected I m a feminist because I believe in abolishing oppressive hierarchies and I m vegan because I similarly think our treatment of nonhuman animals is abhorrent and unjustified I also believe very strongly that we need to dramatically reduce our carbon emissions to create a better future and veganism  appears to be the best thing we can do to that end as individuals    With that said  as with other systemic issues and other abolitionist perspectives it s rarely as simple as just making the oppressive system disappear Just like the existing economic system in the US depends on patriarchy to survive  particularly the value created by unpaid domestic tasks  such that just abolishing those practices without restructuring things would create major issues around for example childcare much of the world s food system  especially in wealthier countries has created structures of dependence on animal exploitation So part of the task of animal liberation necessarily involves interrogating those structures working towards food justice and fighting the commodification of food  which we should instead work to produce together and distribute to all  
Feminism,1615642580,Except that they re totally wrong A vegan diet is not  very expensive  Like yeah if you buy all the frozen boutique shit from Whole Foods it is but most vegans don t do that 
Feminism,1615642530,I haven t noticed that before and I don t know any feminist who is against men s mental health support or tries to gaslight men The only cases I can think of is when men insert themselves into a conversation about women s or queer people s issues trying to make it about themselves or when they expect feminists to create a space for them instead of doing it themselves But even then the problem isn t men s mental health but derailing the conversation and feeling entitled to women s labor 
Feminism,1615642402,Well I believe why men are more likely to commit violence is because theyre socialised into it for most of their lives  I was wondering that given that women are now becoming more accustomed to positions where violence is an option  police officers soldiers and the increase in media portraying women as capable of violence  female led action movies along with a sense of retaliation if it could mean anything 
Feminism,1615642149,I haven t noticed this at all At least on askfeminists I see a lot of discussion of men s mental health suicide depression etc As for how to change it when men post asking what they can do to support feminism I tend to include male support groups on that list I think encouraging men to seek this kind of mutual support is really important in improving male mental health outcomes because many men find themselves pretty isolated

Feminism,1615641571,I think it s useful to clarify here that a popular definition of veganism in leftist vegan spaces is  A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude   as far as is possible and practicable   all forms of exploitation of and cruelty to animals for food clothing or any other purpose and by extension promotes the development and use of animal free alternatives for the benefit of humans animals and the environment  So a person who is in a food desert and doesn t have good access to vegetables but seeks to exclude animal products or access them in a less exploitative way  such as dumpster diving could still consider themselves vegan even if they need to supplement their diet with animal products Veganism as a movement especially liberal veganism can definitely have classist elements but I wanted to clarify because a lot of people aren t aware of how many leftist vegans work to incorporate anti classism and anti ableism into the definition I think people also underestimate how barring the food desert scenario and other considerations veganism can often be cheaper than non veganism I became vegan through my ex partner who went vegan as a homeless teenager

Feminism,1615640608,Black people and Muslims do face systemic racism and this results in racially motivated violence against them Again just because a news story drives women to recount times where they have felt unsafe or been targeted doesn t mean they think all men are doing these things Just that in the moment they don t know who does so they do certain things to make themselves feel safer If as a result of these stories men started routinely being targeted in public in the same way that black people and Muslims are then this would be a different conversation

Feminism,1615638865, gt So if I said that I fear black men when I walk around London because they might stab me what is the difference between that and what women say about men in general Aside from the obvious racism  Have you ever had a black man openly admit to you that he d like to stab you Have you ever been told that it was probably a compliment if a black man told you he wanted to stab you Are you likely to be blamed if you are stabbed by a black man Is he likely to be apprehended tried and convicted for his violent assault on your person Are people likely to ask you why you were out in a place to be stabbed Are people likely to question what you did to draw the attention of this black man who stabbed you Are people likely to ask what you were wearing to attract the attention of the black man who stabbed you Are people likely to discredit your story of being stabbed by a black man based on your friendships with other black men If you were intoxicated are people likely to frame your intoxication as an irresponsibility in which your being stabbed by a black man is an inevitable outcome  Are people likely to assume that you were lying about being stabbed Are people likely to assume that you in fact invited this black man to stab you and simply regret the outcome because it didn t go as planned Are you likely to lose your friends and family because they don t believe you were stabbed by a black man Would your friends find it hard to believe you  because they ve never known a black man who stabbed anyone 
Feminism,1615638408,I don t see how feminist as a movement extends itself generally to non human females  Honestly saying veganism and feminina goes hand by hand it s kinda classist     If someone isn t a vegan it makes them less feminist Yeah I do think it s like this 
Feminism,1615637980,Not really I think there is a slight possibility here in the U S but your causal mechanism is wrong It s not enough to want to commit violence you have to be  competent in it which involves a degree of socialization and comfort with violence not afforded to women  For example you can see in U S data on  suicidal ideation attempts and completion   that women are more likely to think about or try suicide but less likely to kill themselves Men are much more likely to kill themselves and a lot of that is men s comfort and competence with guns  it s not like it s so much harder for a woman to obtain a gun in the US  The same is true of men s violence against others they are more competent because they have been socialized int it  So as U S society becomes more comfortable with the idea of women as soldiers and cops and other gun wielding occupations we can expect more women to become comfortable with guns and so more likely to use guns In which case we might see a rise in women committed violence but not solely women on men violence The female on male violence we do see won t be significantly political in the sense you have in mind if at all it will be women using violence in the same sorts of situations men do  And this is speculation but it seems to me the women most committed to the feminist movement will be least likely to join gun wielding professions  However much female on male violence increases we can expect a sharper rise for women s suicides  So no I don t think it s going to happen  Incidentally  lame is considered by many people  to be an ableist word   You might be using  insane a little too casually too 
Feminism,1615637479,I meant unintelligent  sorry Also in terms of men using  notallmen to derail discussions on sexual harassment I agree that this statement is true and I believe this is equally as damaging as the point I make   I think both sides of this debate are straying from the fundamental aim of the recent debates on sexual harassment to raise awareness about what sexual harassment is and how to prevent males from violating a woman s sanctity Both sides are using this debate to make comments on women men that are not explicitly linked or relevant to the discussion on male abuses of females and that is my concern 
Feminism,1615637179, gt am I just going insane over here Yes Like understand that overall men are the ones who perpetrate the most violence again women  and men and it has nothing to do with the  strained relationship between the genders   gt For example do you think the movement could grow more militant and possibly violent with more inaction from the systems No but it s a nice boogeyman to get people to be in favor of suppressing activism and progressive movements 
Feminism,1615637162,I pointed out that it s fine for women to fear all men and that generalisations about men in terms of the threat they pose is fine  my point is that often these fears lead into other generalisations about the nature of men in general This is an important distinction to make and it seems that people reading these posts do not recognise this distinction This is not a  notallmen post at all I am just concerned with people using issues concerning sexual harassment to make comments about men that are not explicitly related to sexual issues This same thing happens with race and men make the same generalisations about women as well usually in a romantic context This sort of comment that you make is what I think scares a lot of guys in this scenario You can be fearful of men in general because of the threat some pose and you can of course try to spread awareness to men about what sexual harassment is and how to prevent But you can t use sexual harassment by males as an excuse to discount men s opinions on certain topics you cannot use it to say men are intelligent and you cannot use it to say men are undeserving of certain luxuries 
Feminism,1615635761,Right but I said that because I was replying to someone who was making a ridiculous leap with zero evidence or logic applied Hitler being vegetarian doesn t mean vegetarians are somehow evil Some vegans being contradictory doesn t mean all vegans care more about animals than humans  You re right that many people are contradictory I have seen that many times already today 
Feminism,1615635533,     text Like   most   legumes  C   lentil   is of   sulphur E       containing   amino   acids      text Fat  A          grams  Protein  E                         It s clear that I m the only one here willing to do research so I ll post this here You are wrong You don t actually need supplements to live  Unless I m mistaken you re probably eating vegetables anyway otherwise you ve got a lot bigger problems on your plate than protein deficiency ever could be Please stop associating religious extremists with a problem with one kind of meat with veganity All of your arguments so far have been about beef There s so many more animals out there that suffer I m going to stop responding here Lentils are cheaper than beef Religious extremism isn t the same as veganism and doesn t give anyone an excuse to keep abusing animals An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind etc Best of luck
Feminism,1615635467,Personally I don t think so I think it s a complex issue because there is no such thing as ethical mass production of food whether it involves animal products or not Vegetables and fruit don t pick themselves and farm labor at scale is  rife with human rights abuse   Ethically produced food is expensive and it s doubtful that you could feed the planet with it It took the Haber Bosch process for agricultural output to reach current levels which has its  share of problems   Economic and environmental aspects  and having the entire world move away from it is no easy task There are a number of good reasons to keep consumption of meat low but the ethics of getting rid of meat  let alone other animal products entirely are a lot more complicated 
Feminism,1615635268,I don t want protection I just want them to stay out of the way

Feminism,1615633863,Is it an echo chamber or are you just wrong You are very much assuming we all think the same  which is not true Belittling too considering everyone is saying you are wrong and you just want to chalk it up to echo chamber rather than us being cognizant enough to call you out I think maybe you are very idealistic about men I get it I too would rather be in that world Unfortunately that is not the world we live in and there are     s of years of progress we have to make before getting to the point where trust in men exists 
Feminism,1615633605,If you are able to obtain steak despite government regulation on cow slaughter and the actus of right wing religious extremists I genuinely doubt you can t afford lentils beans or whatever Again no one here is forcing anyone to go vegan they are merely pointing out that it is the best thing to do morally if you can  I m just saying that long ago the same arguments you made against protecting cows are the arguments people have made to restrict the rights of other people in the past All that the vegans are asking is that you really evaluate your opinions and understand that you don t need meat to live

Feminism,1615633582,Yokes I m a little worried you are a bit racist that you want to compare the group men  who are societal aggressors to Black people  who do not have a unifying aggressive feature  as no race does  
Feminism,1615633434,I don t know why you started with  btw I m a woman   When you have to qualify your statement does that make you wonder if it s the wrong thing to say I think you re totally ignoring the fact of what reality is when it comes to the patriarchy It sounds like you dislike when we say men do these behaviors and maybe it s more palatable to hear patriarchy does these behaviors I gotta tell you there is also individual responsibility at play here  Most people on this thread have had an uncomfortable interaction with a man at the gym given that we are talking about it here So maybe think that men at the gym are sometimes a problem  Women do get harassed by men I really don t get what you re saying here  How does it make sense to flip it on women We aren t the aggressor towards men on a society wide basis while men are the aggressor towards women  and other men on a society wide basis

Feminism,1615633240,That s a leap I might need evidence for  How tf do you go from someone believing all sentient creatures deserve basic rights to somehow that same person believing certain people don t deserve basic rights  That makes a negative amount of sense If anything it would make more sense for the opposite to be true If you a willing to extend human rights to animals that are fundamentally different from yourself that you can t even communicate with it stands to reason you would also want to ensure all humans have those rights and more no

Feminism,1615632774,Maybe it could be divided by students non students as well I ve had  creepy encounters with older people at the gym when I was in high school  At one point there was a   yo man who would talk to me and hit on me  ask me for my number and all that  when I was    It was highly uncomfortable and after I denied him I felt like shit seeing him again so I had to change up my gym routine to avoid him The other instance was when someone from my school administration  a fellow woman  took a picture of me while I was working out The administrators at my high school all made me uncomfortable because at the time I had an eating disorder and they all took it upon themselves to make  positive comments about it 
Feminism,1615632752,Honestly I don t see women saying men need to protect them from rape unless you consider not raping someone protecting them from rape  Women have been fine setting up sexual assault crisis centers on their own working on changing police procedures around sexual assault investigations on their own etc   RAINN and MeToo were both founded by women  It s been women in law who have done the most work for sexual harassment and sexual assault laws  And if we are talking about police forces well   there are women in police departments and while that tends to be a very male dominated and macho field it s extremely hard to make the argument that it is that way because women demanded it  So I would ask why this person thinks women are expecting men to protect them  To me the evidence suggests that women are quite willing to try to protect themselves and each other they just want men to not make that protection more difficult

Feminism,1615655247,I follow the Dan Savage school of thought in stuff like this  Cheating in this context is still bad and transgressed the boundaries of the monogamous relationship but infidelity is not always a relationship extinction event In this case the two primary partners have found a middle ground where both parties are getting needs met that might not have otherwise come to light without the cheating If they are able to move past that and it becomes beneficial all good If however there s mistrust and lingering resentment then the primary relationship may be damaged beyond repair and no amount of fetishizing bisexual women is going to save what is already broken 
Feminism,1615655126,Wow my friend Consent sounds like the least of your issues It sounds like your relationship is in a really rough spot Sex can be a barometer for the health of a relationship When the relationship isn t in a good place sex plummets It can be a symptom of a deeper issue not the actual issue itself If the solution you and your wife came to was to schedule regular sex it might be that you and her are trying to treat the symptom  no sex instead of the root cause If there is a unresolved root cause that is making her not truly want to have sex with you you most definitely could pick up on that She may even say the words  I enthusiastically give consent and want to mean it but we can t force our bodies to be into sex that we don t truly want And you deserve a partner who is genuinely enthusiastic about the idea of having sex with you I don t know what is going on with your wife but there s something deeper at play here that no amount of verbal consent is going to fix

Feminism,1615655008,I mean the man is still behaving as if lesbian sex is not real sex if they are truly in a monogamous relationship Think of other situations where a partner may have wanted to explore some that their partners doesn t or have sex with someone that has features that their partner doesn t take bdsm or a very large breasted woman while their partner has small breasts Would  those situations warrant exploration and would this couple still consider themselves monogamous 
Feminism,1615654878,This is a great question   It s not an uncommon scenario and I think you ll get a variety of opinions on this For me the answer is kind of complicated Going by the quote  she feels no need to explore with other men  I certainly wouldn t consider it to be  as problematic because the man isn t imposing a view on who she can and cannot date on the basis of gender I would consider that a private personal decision about who she wants to pursue in a nonmonogamous relationship rather than an OPP where you have a  policy or agreement with your primary partner With that said I still think this can get dicey Part of this stems from my own experiences I m a bisexual woman aligned nonbinary person   I ve dated a few bisexual women who are in primary relationships with men or who have mostly only dated men Some of those relationships have been really positive in other situations I ve felt very strongly that I was not really being seen as a person but more as a novelty or a way for the person I was dating to validate her bisexuality and her attraction to women So in general I feel wary of people who are looking to date a certain gender for the  experience of it Dating a woman is not the same as dating a man but the experience of dating one man is also very different from the experience of dating another and the same goes for two different relationships with women Particularly in the bisexual community I think it s easy for a weird sort of fetishization of a specific gender to emerge If you look through bisexual meme pages you see a lot of memes like  Yes i m bisexual I m attracted to women because women are incredible and I m attracted to men because i love making bad choices  And I think that s something to challenge because it puts women on a weird pedestal  even as it also puts down men  Sorry that went a little off topic I guess ultimately I still think it s something to interrogate What does someone think they will get out of a relationship with a woman that is different Do they have unreasonable expectations of their potential partner etc But I think of it a little more positively than having a rule imposed by someone who doesn t take relationships with women seriously   By this I mean that I don t identify as a woman but my experiences in the world are generally similar to those of a woman because most people read me that way 
Feminism,1615654610, gt But however they don t contain all the essential amino acids but however that they can be done by combining it with rice or wheat making it a complete protein so you can t have them individually you would have to combine it with something You would need to have that right combination Your link shows that they do have all the essential amino acids though  all plants do Protein combing is a myth though The original author who started it retracted it on later books and the idea was popularized by Vogue magazine in the   s with no science supporting it Amino acids are very very easy to get  You could literally just eat potato s and get all of them

Feminism,1615653398,Baroness Jones is claiming that now but I m not buying it She was in the House of Lords when she suggested a  pm curfew for men I don t think it was a reply to a comment made by anyone else there and it isn t the place where people make ridiculous suggestions to counter ridiculous suggestions reported in the media She is a member of the Green Party who are pretty irrelevant in the UK so I think it might just be an ill conceived publicity stunt Politicians being politicians I feel sorry for Sarah s father boyfriend etc having to read things like that  before her death had even been confirmed and her mother and other female family  friends having to read the  advice to stay at home

Feminism,1615652328,I agree that people are often unnecessarily rude to vegans but I think it s that exact  moral superiority that annoys people I mean right here in this thread there s a person who compared  eating meat because you like it to  being a serial killer because you like murdering people  and then agreed that anyone who  isn t vegan is a bad person That shit is just unnecessary 
Feminism,1615652285,So I just went and looked more into the OPP and  I have some questions  if you wouldn t mind helping me out  I m trying to fully understand the issue I feel like I am at a disadvantage for really understanding because I am not fully immersed in the LGBT community I try to keep up but I don t always know  Let s say there s a heterosexual couple and the women recently decided she s bi She had grown up in a conservative home and never explored the female attracted side but he husband encourages her to express when she sees people she s attracted to  ie in movies and things   This turns into permission to test out her female attracted side Her male attracted side has already been explored and she has settled and enjoys her husband so she feels no need to explore with other men  Is this still oppressive ideas parading as something else  Can you have the set up where the woman can be with other women without it necessarily being spawned from those kind of  not real sex beliefs

Feminism,1615652043,God this is exactly the reason why this stuff is an issue If you want to solve sexual harassment by making men uncomfortable instead of presenting arguments that build bridges between men and women that demonstrate to men how many of them have wronged women you will not achieve much This focus of a movement to make men uncomfortable as opposed to just trying to raise awareness about sexual harassment is absurd 
Feminism,1615652034,Sexual assault is one of the easiest crimes to get away with Easy enough where I saw Twitter thread from a rapist s perspective explaining how to get away with tape Not everyone is going to have their assault captured on multiple cctv cameras unless it s a blitz attack that happens outside in a big city like mine but that s if you re  lucky enough to have it captured Not everyone is  lucky to have multiple witnesses Want to know why Because rapists don t usually rape in front of other people unless those other people are partaking in it Some victims don t go to the hospital police immediately after for a myriad of reasons I run a statistically small chance believing a liar and it s a fact whether you want to accept it or not 
Feminism,1615651913,In my opinion your responses epitomise everything that is wrong about these discussions You and many other feminists are constantly going back to labelling every opinion on this topic as just a  notallmen post However as I have explained many times I am concerned about victims of sexual harassment and I believe that is the fundamental issue at hand But people use this as a pretext for the shaming of others for reasons not related to sexual harassment Also how is the generalisations about race women different to generalisations about men They are all concerned with a victim perpetrator relationship And the reason I am concerned about generalisations at this time is because of the fact victimhood should never EVER be seen as an excuse to belittle others for unrelated reasons no matter who is doing the generalising It is not a healthy way to start a movement and bring awareness to a central issue 
Feminism,1615651911,The socialization of male violence goes a lot deeper than that 
Feminism,1615651785,Interesting In the contexts I m familiar with  seperatism refers to essentially self segregating in general  i e woman only  communities  not just spaces and organizations  I suppose the word is being used differently by different groups 
Feminism,1615651635,No free thought got it I shall remove myself Thank you
Feminism,1615651616,Thanks    TBF I usually don t I have a lot of non vegan friends and family members who I love and do not consider to be bad people But people like to attack us so much for the tiniest thing I think I deserve to sometimes allow myself to be proud of the changes I have made to my lifestyle and diet for the sake of the environment and animal welfare 
Feminism,1615651093,Yeah don t preemptively announce that you re not trying to find out where someone lives if they haven t brought it up first that s just creepy and would make me think you were if it hadn t crossed my mind before
Feminism,1615651067,I don t think I ve ever met a vegan who openly admits they enjoy looking down on non vegans so uh kudos I guess 
Feminism,1615650905,TBF it seems pretty obvious to me that if it is reasonably possible for you to not cause harm to a sentient creature it is probably morally better to not cause harm than to cause harm I m not going to attack anyone or call anyone a bad person for causing the harm anyway because I don t think that that does anyone any good but I will enjoy the view from my moral high ground 
Feminism,1615650553,Having a fetish doesn t make you a bad person Cheating kind of does As long as everyone is happy the arrangement is fine The only slight issue is that all must remember that relationships involving two women are just as serious as those that involve a man and a woman So don t get into the  it s not cheating because it was another woman territory That doesn t mean that it s not ok to set a boundary that she won t have sex with other men but she will have sex with other women though But all parties need to think about why they find that acceptable For example if she is sexually attracted to women but not romantically attracted to women that is honest and as long as nobody objects go for it If it s because the boyfriend doesn t take relationships between two women seriously that s homophobic 
Feminism,1615649919,I don t think it is a bogeyman and is more an actual experience that the individual is having 
Feminism,1615649694,let s  a typo don t understand youe needless rage check your conscience at the door women unite 
Feminism,1615649644,Please respect our  top level comment rule   which requires that all direct replies to posted questions must come from feminists and reflect a feminist perspective Non feminists may participate in nested comments only Comment you won t get another warning 
Feminism,1615649504,Fair enough on a per gram of protein basis lentils actually cost less than meat But however they don t contain  all   the essential amino acids but however that they can be done by combining it with rice or wheat making it a complete protein so you can t have them individually you would have to combine it with something You would need to have that right combination But for getting a high amount of protein with lentils it isn t easy to do that According to  this   nutrition source the amount of protein in one cup or    g of cooked lentils is     g with    kcals but however that isn t a small amount of lentils you would have to eat a lot of them To just even get like   g from it you would need to consume more than a pound of it along with something else so as to make it a complete protein further increasing the calories to get that For the lean cut of beef the  amount   protein in it is   g per    g with    kcals or about   g per    g and    kcals That s more than twice the amount for a slightly higher kcals while for beef you can get   g of protein for just eating slightly less than half a pound of it which is much easier to do If you re someone who wants to eat a lower calories diet but still wants atleast like    g of protein then getting it done using a vegan diet isn t easy there s too many carbs in lentils to let you get the high amount of protein in a lower amount of calories so you might require protein supplements which then costs a lot of money 
Feminism,1615649036,Actually I m speaking about Latin American feminism I said  I think most feminists HERE  meaning Latin America do practice separatism in some degree and the following statements between parentheses are examples of that I understand that it s not what US feminists think but it is here in Latin America 
Feminism,1615648957,Sure women doing all the work for dudes   That s not a new one 
Feminism,1615648848,Well she cheated  wrong He fetishizes them  wrong BUT if they are both happy I don t see no issue 
Feminism,1615648728,She messed up by cheating Maybe he does have a fetish or interest in watching woman on woman action And yeah it s a bit problematic that some guys fetishize female bisexuality But this couple seems to have come to an agreement  I ve also heard of the  one penis rule which as mentioned does not take into account pre op trans women  That said if I had friends with such an arrangement it s really none of my business  or anyone else s  If that s what makes them happy who am I to judge 
Feminism,1615648536, gt most feminists believe men shouldn t call themselves feminists Speak for yourself 
Feminism,1615648478,And my responses seem to show your opinion matters to me  Yet here we are
Feminism,1615648211,Not sure anyone is a  bad person but this isn t a healthy relationship  The BF might find this  sexy but he s on the outside looking in and will likely get hurt  If the GF actually cares cared about him she should cut ties for the same reason  So she can cheat but he can t  So much to digest here   all of it will give a stomach ache 
Feminism,1615647897,As a pansexual woman I would find both of their behaviors problematic  Hers for cheating while in a monogamous relationship and his for seeing her relationship with another woman as less valid threatening 
Feminism,1615647812,Haha well yes but that s not generally the  free tampons argument 
Feminism,1615647799,It is called that way here in Latin America For the  M demonstrations there is usually a strictly women only block which is called the  separatist block  for example  here    I get that in the US and other places you might have different meanings for that word but that s how we use it here 
Feminism,1615647495,Having women only spaces  and other safe spaces is not  separatism  
Feminism,1615647354,i mean I think they should and so should toilet paper and food and every other basic living necessity living should be free for everyone
Feminism,1615647314,I think the sad thing is whether Allen abused Dylan or Mia coached her either way she was abused as a child and that is really sad 
Feminism,1615647200,The  double standards people point out aren t double standards and honestly sometimes the things people say are just kind of dumb      Like the reason it s more ok for women to say they hate men compared to men saying they hate women is because the women who  hate men are usually at worst annoying the men are usually murderers and rapists 
Feminism,1615647081,when men feel genuine fear going outside because someone might kill you specifically because they re a man then I ll accept  not all men 
Feminism,1615647004,Yo that is so true That s the same thing I was thinking You re right and people don t see it like this but it is very problematic and can be terrible for a plethora of reasons 
Feminism,1615646957,For me the questions usually don t but the answers often do 
Feminism,1615646575,The gf is a bad person for cheating She just got lucky in not facing any consequences The bf is   maybe not bad per se  but kind of dumb for thinking with his penis Just because he finds it  hot doesn t change the fact that he is still in a relationship with a woman who lied to him and betrayed his trust It makes me think he doesn t care about women s minds or hearts at all only their bodies 
Feminism,1615646553,The people in this  arrangement might be content but the comments are right Both of these people are walking red flags and I wouldn t want to be friends with folks who cheat fetishize my sexuality who think that homosexual cheating relationships are somewhat more permissible than heterosexual ones that sex with women is implied to be inferior to sex with men  ah  and so on     I find these people distasteful and if more folks have this mentality it will soon become toxic for the lgbt community and for women who date men  probably already the case  
Feminism,1615646539,Separatist as in not having anything to do with men unless it can t be helped To be fair I think most feminists here do practice separatism in some degree  most feminists organizations I know are women only it s a common practice to ask men to refrain from attending feminist protests on March   most feminists believe men shouldn t call themselves feminists and so on  
Feminism,1615646381,I know   I ve been stared in the gyms for years My response is to look them back dead in the eye  Out on the streets much worse things happen to us but we never give up on going out and living our lives as we should In the end everyone is free to have or demand women only hours or spaces I think it radicalizes women as a gender and reinforces sexism and therefore I do not support it That s my take
Feminism,1615646182,Choice feminism is counterproductive Choices do not exist in a vacuum  comic  
Feminism,1615646174,A couple thoughts on this  If they wouldn t let him in if women are uncomfortable then it isn t truly trans inclusive It s just the only thing available for him   Saying  other ladies in the context of that last sentence makes it sound like you consider him as a lady from how it reads which I doubt is your intention or how you see him I just wanted to point that out because language and context is important and conveys more than surface level meaning especially with the subtle nuance in gender topics  Saying  this is understandable and following with a  but negates the initial statement Yes my views on this are valid So are your cousin s as another trans person In my original comment I even said that not every trans person will look at this the same If the only option is a women s time slot that is open to all trans people then we would have to be okay with that out of necessity What is better is an LGBTQ specific time slot but that isn t a common practice in gym settings so we are forced to accept women time slots or not I don t but your cousin is certainly within his right to make his own decision with that  I d be interested in hearing from your cousin first hand on this rather than someone speaking on his behalf I m sure if given the option of a women s safe space and a LGBTQ  safe space he d probably prefer the latter because then he doesn t run the risk of being shut out if women in the their dedicated space don t want him there 
Feminism,1615646083,I mean Yeah  If you have the ability to not kill or abuse animals to eat it s definitely better to do so  At no point have I said that it s the ultimate objective decided on moral relativism
Feminism,1615645959,What is acceptable and what isn t within a private relationship is the right and responsibility of those parties involved Whether shes s   and he s   isn t within your realm to decide comment on nor pass judgement In the    s it wasn t anyone s business of two gay men or lesbian women were in love In the    s it wasn t anyone s business if two people of different skin tones dated and married  People will choose for themselves what is and isn t for them  Choice It s truly the only unique thing we have that s absolutely our own 
Feminism,1615645856,That s also not just the definition used by leftist circles It s the definition used by the society that originally came up with the word 
Feminism,1615645832,I think labeling anyone a bad person over sex that is between adult humans who consent to it is being a bit harsh 
Feminism,1615645812,The answers by feminists to the questions often teach me things and make me rethink my stance Just like in all of reddit the real gold is in the comments 
Feminism,1615645811,How dare you assume anything about my friendship You don t know me Sorry if we dont sit around and talk about feminism for  years You obviously are taking some of what I say and not listening to the rest I explained why I want to ask Your right telling him after the fact is a bad choice of words I have since changed my mind on that I am not dodging anything What I m aiming at is to open up the conversation on his misogyny and toxic masculinity
Feminism,1615669266,i mixed up the links they were the other way around i also missed the page   stastistics which are a lot closer but in the UN report   is never mentioned and was just unsure where it had came from
Feminism,1615669039,Yeah I m sorry but the report isn t really all that  new for any femme person existing in public spaces I know all that stuff because I ve lived it It s great to see it on paper but it s literally all things women and feminism in particular have been demanding for ages
Feminism,1615669001,My anecdotal evidence and that of my friends would strongly support the high number of     I know it may look shockingly high but this just shows how wide spread this problem is 
Feminism,1615668991,just the way the artical is writen is taking somthing away from the stastitic  lying  was probbably a poor way of putting it
Feminism,1615668903,   its definitely way too many and I think it s a real issue id highly recommend reading the full un report its really interesting and talks about some suggestions  to fix the issue
Feminism,1615668683,What are you talking about The second paragraph in the article you claim says    says  gt Among women aged          said they had been sexually harassed while    of women of all ages said they had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces I don t get your problem 
Feminism,1615668403,If you have any follow up questions I ll try my best to answer   
Feminism,1615668368,I have to say is    that much better tho Like   sure things have to be reported accurately and if it s faulty that should be corrected  But    is still way too many people
Feminism,1615668365,I m with your ex MIL on this one It seems like you re trying to understand the idea so I ll explain it in a little more detail Breasts are not inherently sexual Why The only function of breasts is to feed babies They are often erogenous zones yes but so are ears and no one asks people to cover up their ears If you go to other countries  ex certain tribes in Africa women walk around topless and it s normal The only reason boys think they re  magical is because they are seen as taboo due to sexualization by men Also the idea of  exposing children to breasts doesn t make sense Most children breastfeed Again this goes back to the cultural taboo 
Feminism,1615668308,I am not saying this to be unkind but do you realise how hilarious it is that you  won t somebody think of the childrened women s breasts when they are literally for feeding children and most of us spend a significant portion of our early years with our faces attached to women s bare nappies 
Feminism,1615668091,I didn t write the articles so   I don t know Who are you accusing of lying 
Feminism,1615668084,I think the problem here is not the existence of absolute consent but the lack loss of trust between you and your wife And you re trying to address this by going into some elevated philosophical questioning instead of addressing the root cause of the problem Why does your wife doesn t want to have sex with you anymore  Maybe it s on you maybe it s on her it s probably both but nobody here can answer that for you What happened  What changed  What didn t  Why  Maybe she doesn t desire you anymore maybe she s not satisfied with you can you accept those thoughts  This subreddit is not your personnal therapist and that s what you need Also forcing somebody to do something they don t want to by scheduling it regularly and expecting them to enjoy it is the opposite of a solution 
Feminism,1615667583,Yes I see that now That makes much more sense Apologizes 
Feminism,1615666898,As I explained somewhere else in the thread we give the term  separatism a broader meaning 
Feminism,1615666839,Alright I ve decided to ask about the concept of  punching up vs punching down  A person of a priviliged group say men cannot make jokes about people of a oppressed group say women However the reverse is acceptable So when a privileged person is made fun of by an oppressed person they cannot make a joke about the oppressed in response  I admit this seems unfair to me as I didn t choose to be born in a priviliged group and I didn t choose to take on this role I m just supposed to take it and I can t do anything in response This probably also relates to my fragility 
Feminism,1615666780,I don t believe there is a spectrum of consent  There is a spectrum of  activities you can consent to and there is a spectrum of  clarity of communication  non verbal vs  OK vs  here is exactly what I do and do not want  But consent is either yes or no  It s either there or it isn t If it s not clear consent then you assume there is no consent Which is why it s not considered consent if the person is intoxicated or a minor Maybe under other circumstances they would still say yes but you can t know that so you have to treat it as a no It sounds like you objected to the lack of intimacy and connection because you want your wife to be enthusiastic   which is certainly reasonable And maybe she went along with your statement because she was relieved not to feel obligated But I don t think you ever had an issue of consent She consented however grudgingly I think you had more of a relationship issue 
Feminism,1615666116,Fair enough but the way OP phrased the question it sounds like  who did something wrong  and that was definitely her 
Feminism,1615666023,Cheating is a betrayal of trust However the boyfriend appears to have forgiven the girlfriend for that betrayal  They have come to a personal arrangement is none of anyone else s business 
Feminism,1615665890,I wouldn t say she is a bad person She made at least one bad choice but people are bigger than their worst moment 
Feminism,1615665733,Thanks this is one of the better explanations I ve seen 
Feminism,1615665690, The word  cheat was used so this is not a consensual scenario  initially  
Feminism,1615665319,I have done my own research Patriarchy was not created by men It was first established in smaller tribal units and men became dominant figures because of their physical superiority  in a world built on violence the more physical beings took hold of leadership  Patriarchal ideas were created and reasserted by men throughout history particularly in relation to religion  I also don t think the patriarchal system was designed to oppress women  as many academics agree It was a system designed so that every one in society was deemed to have a  proper place I m not saying that this was the right thing to do at all that s just the idea behind it I also do think the system has oppressed women but I don t think the initial intention of it was to suppress women  In terms of patriarchy today I m not entirely sure it exists There are ideas and beliefs that circulate that could exist under patriarchal structures but patriarchy doesn t really exist as a system nowadays in my opinion I know that you can say rape culture the wage gap etc are examples that  prove the existences patriarchal system but they just aren t Men are more often victims of violent crime more men are incarcerated most of the victims of war are men most people that are homeless are men and it can even be argued that men are more persecuted and disproportionately discriminated against in many things such as scholarships or job hiring Even in terms of economic dominance those in the very top are a group of extremely successful men that in no way represent men as a whole I don t think the sexist opinions of a minority men are sufficient to explain the existence of a patriarchy So yeah I sort of have done a bit of research I just asked for your own definition and you got defensive about it   
Feminism,1615665278,This is an interesting article It effectively argues men should be silent and to the side I wouldn t say it endorses separatism or men not calling themselves feminist  Still a good article though 
Feminism,1615664293,Enthusiastic consent exists just fine but it requires that you have a trust relationship so you and trust what they say and express You don t have that trust right now in fact you sound like you are having a trust crisis Anyone could lie to you about anything so how can you possibly trust their consent  I had one of those recently and it was rough That s definitely something to take up in therapy 
Feminism,1615664244,I would rather get men to not sexually assault and rape us It s funny how we even have to ask and then the ones that are  not all men can t even see that this isn t our problem to fix It s happening  to us  Do you want the world to be a fairer better world Then this is what is happening to all women around you Because of men Do something 
Feminism,1615664218,Oh yeah definitely I m not socially inept to the point where I thought it was a good idea I m just socially inept to the point I literally didn t know what else I could say 
Feminism,1615662596,Well your post ist primary example Why does a group call itself  Men s Right s Activist when they don t do anything to help vulnerable men but are exclusively ranting about mean feminists doing nothing Feminists acknowledge that many men are vulnerable and they are supporting gay men depressed men trans men assaulted men    Women s shelters exist because women volunteer donate and lobby for them They also exist because women usually don t own the home or can t pay the rent to throw their abusive partner out Nobody stops men to do the same Considering the wealth and power men hold overall this should be easy I wouldn t be surprised if there are more feminists knowing that there is an  International men s day and when it is than MRAs 
Feminism,1615662405,I think its bad He finds lesbian sex hot and thats the only reason he s allowing this There s a reason she cheated likely problems in the relationship which this isnt solving Cheating isnt right I feel in a good relationship if there are problems you try and solve them instead of going outside the relationship and if it cant work then end the relationship I know abuse exists but I believe in trying to get out before doing cheating 
Feminism,1615662269,So you are quite happy to obstruct a harmless paternity test so you can dodge the consequences of your infidelity 
Feminism,1615660808,Is there consent or is there lying Is there manipulation or enthusiasm That s pretty much it 
Feminism,1615660277,Cheating is complicated there are gray areas and various circumstances People will attack people for cheating so quickly  Not saying I m better or whatnot but it s something that should be heard out as to why Sadly   a lot of women have died when men found out the women found loving elsewhere And folks still attack those who are murdered just because they were in an affair  The boyfriend   it seems like hr s trying to control her sexuality by  allowing her only to sleep with women while being with him so that s not cool I see why she cheated 
Feminism,1615660268,Hang on what do you mean by  women being expected to do all the work for dudes   Can you explain please Thanks 
Feminism,1615660090,I have given some thought to the matter yes as most feminists in my continent have If you are interested in the Latin American perspective on this matter  this article offers a pretty good summary   
Feminism,1615660070,I think it s less about seeing that relationship as invalid non threatening and more about not seeing it as direct competition the same way he would someone of the same sex because when his gf sleeps with another woman his sexual role isn t being taken as sex with a woman is different from sex with a man meanwhile if she were to sleep with a man that would elicit more jealousy as there would be a greater fear of her replacing him with a  more preferable penis wielder a fear which isn t there with the woman  I m assuming these people are cis because I just don t think this exact situation would form the same way if any of them were trans speaking as a trans person who has been cheated on by my former trans partner 
Feminism,1615660005,I mean ya the women is a cheater and the boyfriend is gross for fetishizing bisexual women and wlw relationships but no harm no foul I suppose 
Feminism,1615659740,I can see how you would perceive it that way but to me it s more like men don t view women as a threat to their specific role in the relationship particularly sexually with a man they re concerned that that man will fulfill his own role better for her than he can but with the woman he views it as something different  which he s not exactly wrong about and therefore isn t as threatened because he doesn t feel directly replaced in the same he would if she were having sex with someone more like him 
Feminism,1615659587,I don t think men who are only okay with their gf sleeping with women instead of other men are inherently devaluing sex between women it s moreso that when their gf sleeps with another woman he doesn t feel that his specific role of penis wielder is being replaced she may be sleeping with someone else but she isn t riding someone else s dick  unless it s a trans girl in which case I suppose she might be  
Feminism,1615659579,Seeing as this has been cross posted to another sub with the intent to mock and brigade may I remind everyone that the top level comment rule is still in effect and those participating in brigade will  be immediately banned without discussion 
Feminism,1615659557,Have you considered that asking men no to attend feminist protests and not call them feminism may have and adverse effect on progress  We can t achieve gender equality unless both men and women are part of it Separatism seems like quite a poor solution 
Feminism,1615659461,Wow You cross posted this in another sub in order to mock other users How disappointing Enjoy your ban 
Feminism,1615659167,I disagree Is any animal that hunts to survive a hypocrite If you don t feed your housecat some form of meat I argue you re abusing or neglecting it  Now it s true we as humans have to be more accountable We have the brain power to understand and bodies that could adapt to an all vegan diet Does that obligate us to I don t think so For a few reasons   Best easiest source of necessary protein for the last few thousand years has been meat raised through farming or gathered by hunters We ve built entire cultures around that all over the world You really think it s ethical to go to every culture on earth and tell them to  stop eating the food your culture developed over centuries     if we all just stopped eating meat at this point   can we even imagine what the ecological impact would be What would happen to the tens of thousands of meat and dairy cows Would they all just die Would some survive Would they move into non native environments and cause havoc While I do blame humanity for its egregious interference in nature that doesn t mean I think we can just stop  We need a better less cruel system for sure That s what I m pushing for We need to coexist rather than dominate nature There s plenty of eco friendly ways  meat eaters can still live their lives I don t think it makes them hypocrites at all 
Feminism,1615659031,A lot of the double standards I see people complaining about are actually not the same situation at least not unless you overlook a lot of important factors and take it at the most pared down basic level If I judge a starving person who steals bread differently than a rich person who does the same that doesn t mean I have a double standard in favor of the poor though I m sure there are some rich people who would try to pretend otherwise 
Feminism,1615658985,oh good the privileged white woman is here to keep the latin american women in line I was nearly exposed to a different world view Thank you for saving me from that
Feminism,1615658962,Yes it is well known that meat  especially beef is a very wasteful food source However this is not necessarily true for other animal products such as milk or honey and it does not mean that you have to cut meat consumption entirely to zero either 
Feminism,1615658873,look live and let live the only thing that isn t okay is the cheating  as a woman who dated a bi guy and had talks about non monogamy with him  like I would have been okay with him sleeping with other men  safely but honestly wouldn t have felt as comfortable with him doing that with women  because I am a woman  and its like    well what am I not satisfying there what does she have that I don t But I wouldn t feel that way about a guy cause it s like   I m not in that category we aren t competing at all    like   people analyze shit too much if no one is bothered leave it alone  Don t tell me there s something wrong with the way I feel either okay 
Feminism,1615658787,I think we agree My point is it s the definition according to the people who came up with the word in the first place and generally accepted in and outside of leftist circles The exceptions are just those who don t know about the concept or its history like your example or the people on reddit who claim vegans can t use any oil products cause  a fraction of it comes from dinosaurs 
Feminism,1615658633,I thought  The Hitler Card    was reserved for places like Facebook 
Feminism,1615658528,We should let innocent beings suffer and stay quiet about it just because some people get their feelings hurt Got it 
Feminism,1615658373,A concept of absolute consent would imply that once given it could never be revoked You are correct that such a thing does not exist  there is not any scenario where someone before engaging in sexual or other activity with you could consent and be guaranteed to  never change their mind or their feelings about whatever occurs afterwards  whether there are subsequent sexual encounters the relationship progresses over time  or does not  or the own individuals feelings about the context in which they gave consent can be guaranteed not to change Your experiences as difficult and unfortunate as they are do not render whole cloth the  practice of asking or offering consent in itself meaningless or relevant however  Relationships are made up of many different components Along with sexual commitments  which should include and require consent   there are other commitments you make in regards to open and honest communication to sharing and honouring each other boundaries   etc etc It sounds like your marriage  and the relationship and commitments with your spouse began breaking down some time ago The primary issue between you and your wife is not a lack of enthusiastic consent in regards to sex with your partner scheduled or unscheduled  that is just the particular way the other ways your marriage has already lost trust respect and commitment manifesting  As to how can two people ever trust each other Relationships are about risk  you might mitigate risk by taking other actions outside of sex to build and affirm trust  like communicating offering reciprocity in aid and support etc But it s a fundamental part of the human condition that you can t ever truly know have power over or surety in regards to another person It sounds like you have some pre existing issues with trust in relationships and that your current relationship is also doing harm to your sense of confidence in both yourself and others  I cannot recommend getting solo therapy to deal with those issues with people who are trained to do so enough 
Feminism,1615658254,            But you can be offended by exploitation of    animals without being a vegan  But you can be a hypocrite       Fixed that for you

Feminism,1615658160,Thanks for adding more context I will definitely check it out
Feminism,1615657857,I m not the commenter but have been learning more about nonmonogamy and grew up queer in a conservative home and city for the majority of my life  I think the issue the commenter above is talking about is that the man in the relationship is the one allowing his partner to only be with other women and this is after she had sex with someone else without his prior consent  cheating  This dynamic is not healthy Healthy relationships and partners are supposed to work as a team not have one snatch control while the other isn t looking or assert dominance to get control The need for control is a red flag that the relationship can get toxic and that s without exploring alternatives to monogamy It happens on queer spaces too and the perpetrator is significantly more likely to be a man even then Now in a relationship where a an mspec person wants to explore and grow in their sexuality if both parties agree on what the boundaries are and safety practices then it can be very rewarding It takes a lot of open communication scheduling and consideration  I recommend reading the Ethical Slut not just if you re curious about stepping outside of monogamy but also to get a different perspective and insight on relationships and sex 
Feminism,1615657646, gt is there any evidence that something like this has ever actually happened 
Feminism,1615657300,The society was created by a leftist circle and I promise you it is the definition most vegan circles use Maybe not the definition anti vegan circles use though which is really common in leftist spaces   amp  x   B The definition is popular so that white women on reddit don t use indigenous women  like me as an excuse for why they themselves can t go vegan 
Feminism,1615657105,Sure in the same way you can be a racist and still be a feminist Guess that s why intersectional feminism exists huh 
Feminism,1615656591,Yup Amino acids are very easy to get Your body actually stores excess to combine when it needs it so its very hard to be deficient Because literally all plants have all amino acids as long as you don t starve yourself or only eat bananas or something you ll always get enough 
Feminism,1615656532, gt In my opinion your responses epitomise everything that is wrong about these discussions You and many other feminists are constantly going back to labelling every opinion on this topic as just a  notallmen post However as I have explained many times That because literally that was your post about  gt I am concerned about victims of sexual harassment and I believe that is the fundamental issue at hand But people use this as a pretext for the shaming of others for reasons not related to sexual harassment When   gt Also how is the generalisations about race women different to generalisations about men They are all concerned with a victim perpetrator relationship That s because of power dynamics These statements coming from women and feminists about men have very different impacts and meanings due to that and the context of them is very different than compared to a man saying that about women 
Feminism,1615656435,That is something that wouldn t fly where I live  W Coast of United States  at least not in the major cities They would have to include trans people as well  My dad s gym in the suburbs used to have a   women s only area which was dirty and only included a few pieces of equipment I still used it for the stretching area which didn t exist in the main part of the gym but I felt like a  nd class citizen Ugh My biggest pet peeve about some gyms is when they do not have a dedicated stretching area or they have one but they also store other equipment in there like medicine balls I think many people of any gender would appreciate a space where they can get away from loud talking and grunting  But to your original question a women and trans only time might be complicated because there is no particular time that they work out as opposed to when men do Someone will always be upset because they can not go at the time that is convenient 
Feminism,1615656241,TIL Didn t know that That was interesting So you can actually have plant based protein without combining it with wheat and rice or anything else

Feminism,1615655975,Large scale agricultural definitely has issues but I think its misleading to imply veganism is equal in harm than non veganism in that regard  Most of our farmland and crops are grown to feed livestock   Veganism would actually reduce our amount of agriculture needed From Oxford  Specifically plant based diets reduce food s emissions by up to    depending where you live This reduction is not just in greenhouse gas emissions but also acidifying and eutrophying emissions which degrade terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems Freshwater withdrawals also fall by a quarter Perhaps most staggeringly we would require     billion hectares      less farmland  This would take pressure off the world s tropical forests and release land back to nature  says Joseph Poore     
Feminism,1615655965,Also please define what you think  patriarchy and how that exists This is also something I am interested in 
Feminism,1615655874,All men are not complicit in rape All white people are not complicit in white supremacy These comments are the exact same phraseology used by islamaphobes and racists and it is disgusting And if you had read the point I made about actually understanding my argument you would know that I don t want you to say  some men please stop raping us  I m fine with you guys fearing men as a whole What I don t want you to do is to go further in your comments about men in issues not linked to sexual harassment I e by calling men assholes saying we have fragile egos you are using the discussion on sexual harassment to make derogatory comments about all men for no reason whatsoever It s blatantly wrong And don t make this into a thing of me  policing women s speech  I m trying to ask for people to stop targeting and belittling others for things not linked to sexual harassment It s called asking people to stop being dicks and to start being careful in how they define others 
Feminism,1615655872,Thank you for the input I like to hear opinions of people with experiences other than mine so I appreciate you talking the time to explain  I can definitely see how this could be harmful to the other person  the one not in the couple and could come off as using them for the experience
Feminism,1615655845,Don t you think there s a big difference between a hard and fast curfew suggested by a lawmaker vs concerned people suggesting staying home for people who are scared It is absolutely not normalized to punish women for not staying inside after a certain time and that s what a curfew is 
Feminism,1615655673,The way I see it veganism is a choice Good on you But so long as we have cats and dogs as pets there s gonna be animal exploitation They need meats in their diet and not giving them what they need would also be abuse Now humans are indeed omnivorous and could survive and maybe even thrive on a vegan diet but that s never gonna be the norm By all means keep pushing it s a noble enough goal but it s not so simple as  stop farming animals  I don t agree with any big business meat factories I think if we invested more in individual farms we could grass feed healthier happier animals I also think it s possible to eat an animal and still show respect and compassion  I m kind of biased though Close friend of mine growing up was from a sect of Hinduism called Jainism They re vegan by religion But he never said to me  you and your lifestyle are wrong  But then I met some vegans in college Suffice it to say they soured me on the group  We re all products of the world we were born into Not being a vegan doesn t make anyone bad That s not to say veganism is bad but seriously stay outta my food I ve got my own beliefs 
Feminism,1615685571,This is why realizing I was bi after I came out as trans was tough for me I was polyamorous long before but I really didn t want to just use someone for testing especially as being demi would mean I d be basically risking friendships It worked out with someone who turned into an FWB but it really had me worried for a while 
Feminism,1615685564,What makes someone a good person in this instance Someone who chooses to act in good faith to help a person feel safe when they do not or someone who chooses to do nothing when they could do something that costs them literally nothing to help another person feel more safe in an unsafe world 
Feminism,1615685502,Isn t the function of breast feeding inherently sexual Like it s part of the reproductive process 
Feminism,1615685409,  Breasts are not inherently sexual Why The only function of breasts is to feed babies    Are you even a girl 
Feminism,1615685366,Every woman has an experience of being harassed by men Many experience this starting in childhood Women are socialized to experience this fear because of the high rates of sexual assault of which women are the primary targets Your friend is stuck in a victimization olympics with this argument of who has it worse and that misses the point If your friend does not care about women feeling safe what does that tell you about the character of your friend Is that really someone you want to call a friend Someone so devoid of compassion and empathy Who you associate with is a reflection of you and he is actively encouraging you to join him in that 
Feminism,1615685077,It s difficult to say without knowing him myself but it sounds like he doesn t feel like he should take responsibility for something that isn t his fault 
Feminism,1615684998,Ok  But does perceived safety match actual safety I think that s what he s trying to get at Like walking at night is safer as a woman than for a man yet women tend to report more fear Similar to how driving is more dangerous than flying but people are more scared of flying  Idk it s feels like he made a good point and idk how to respond 
Feminism,1615684871,When it comes to violent crime  he s absolutely right      gt According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics males experienced higher victimization rates than females for all types of violent crime except rape or other sexual assault Also the male on male crime rebuttal that I gave when he pointed that out seems to be problematic  But it just seems like common courtesy and doing nothing has the same effect 
Feminism,1615684762,I couldn t find the exact study but  there are statistics that show that men are more likely to be victims of violent crime    barring sexual assault  I ve heard people argue that this may be due to a false sense of security and not being socialized to expect threats literally everywhere they go like we do  
Feminism,1615684660,I d say he s a good person and has plenty of empathy But he did point out that feeling safe is not the same as actually being safe and I was kinda stumped by that distinction  I guess his point is as long as I m not harassing her she s safe I m not responsible for making her  feel safe 
Feminism,1615684573,I do it without giving much thought It s like holding the door open for someone It s just polite  But his question really stumped me because if I did nothing the person I m trying to make feel safe would still be just as safe 
Feminism,1615684481,That s still  no reason to have men locked up based on nothing more than    She said    We have a justice system built on the foundation of  Innocent until proven guilty for a reason   No one should  ever be sentenced for  any crime unless there s some kind of evidence Sometimes that evidence can be a video tape sometimes it can be DNA sometimes it can be impartial witnesses   But it should  never be the accusation alone that sees someone found guilty in a court of law

Feminism,1615683862, gt For example gently kissing someones neck or ears or caressing someones can cause sexual arousal Well you don t cover your neck ears or lips when you go to the pool do you 
Feminism,1615683832, gt In response he asked me why should I care if women feel safe I dunno has he tried being a good person with actual empathy 
Feminism,1615683765,I wonder do you still not know why you do it Is it because you want to look polite or because you want to give others a feeling you would like to receive yourself Safety  Everyone has something they re afraid of so if it was in someone else s power to not enhance that fear in you by going slightly out of their way wouldn t you want them to Do unto others and all that lol
Feminism,1615683566,I mean it s true You don t  need to do anything But that doesn t mean that doing it isn t the considerate thing to do in the social milieu we live in The real question should be  why not What tangible harm does it bring anyone who chooses to do this 
Feminism,1615683429,From what I know it was originally used by black women to call out racist behaviour However it has been co opted by the misogynists to be a general derogatory term to be dumped on any woman who chooses to stand up for anything and isn t completely amiable in every way possible  so yes current mainstream usage is rather sexist 
Feminism,1615683058,I don t know if this really applies in social situations though OP didn t mention anything about working or applying yourself 
Feminism,1615682837,There are some obvious differences but not so much with the underlying feelings involved more so the way that things are built around us to drive fear into us and the way society responds as well as the specific ways in which people are affected black people don t come out of the closet so there is no hiding 
Feminism,1615682719,It s different due to the hate motivation I believe Both discriminate something that it s inherent of a group of people Both homophobes and racists are motivated by hatred and superiority complex 
Feminism,1615682628,Maybe it s like kiwi and bananas are different but they are both fruit Homophobia and racism are different flavors but at their base they are the same thing Hate ignorance and fear   So great to self examine I am trying to make sure I don t have any weird complexes as well 
Feminism,1615682575, gt He also pointed out that women are socialized to fear men even though it s statistically safer to be a woman than a man I d love to know how being a woman in this fucking society is safer than being a man  You answer appropriately It s common courtesy and common sense to not make people uncomfortable you can t teach him how to be a fucking decent person Some men clearly lack a heart and a brain 
Feminism,1615682381,Because every adult should feel safe going outside after dark and atm with the amount of rapes and assaults that go on against women they don t We really need to work on making town centres feel safe It s a psychological thing about showing you re not a threat 
Feminism,1615682260,I have a problem with it when it becomes a label that is given to any woman who says something a guy disagrees with in order to cast her as uptight or narrow minded which I have seen That s bullshit My understanding is that  Karen is not about all women it s about white women It fits into the ideas of Becky and Miss Anne and can be a commentary on white women using their relatively high ranking in the  white supremacist  patriarchy to abuse and oppress anyone who is not also a white woman or man Is this anti feminist I think that s a discussion that can t happen without examining the intersectionality of the brand of feminism in question There s an opportunity for a deeper discussion here as long as the term  Karen isn t just used as another bludgeon to silence women which I would agree is an anti feminist phenomenon 
Feminism,1615682236,That s a hard question to answer People in general are both good and bad Even the nicest person I know has been bad in situations I m a guy myself and if I really had to pick one gender for being nice over the other I d say women are nicer than men in general but there are both nice and bad people on both sides 
Feminism,1615682063,Pretty much it I try to avoid people especially at night while I m walking There s two reasons one is because I m socially anxious myself and the second is I myself look like a thug and I know people who don t know me feel scared when walking anywhere close to me I usually walk quite fast and it s not a big issue for me to just avoid people in general and go a little bit out of my way to keep distance between them and me Their perception of me can t change but then again they have every right to not feel safe in the fucked up world we live in 
Feminism,1615681973,I also couldn t agree more that whatever the status of breasts sexuality those attracted to breasts have no reason not to control themselves and not make such a big deal of it for Pete s sake I was a big boobed teen and getting  in those cases Men looking at my hoodie covered chest during every interaction is absolutely absurd To this day I dress in men s clothes because of societal body issues and it makes me furious now as an adult that we as a society would continue to cause those feelings whoever s fault it may be 
Feminism,1615681922, gt  Not exactly attractive overweight looks like your typical loser dude on the sofa and he doesn t even act that well  I m not that familiar with his work but I have seen him in publicity photos He seems to look like an average middle aged guy working a sedentary profession I think it s a bit harsh to call him a  typical loser dude  unless you consider the average guy to be a loser 
Feminism,1615681774,I d like to add that it s less helpful to focus on who is a bad person and in fact that feminism main goal is not deciding who is bad but what social structures exist to uphold patriarchy and who is harmed by it It gets painted as an attack and as men are bad and that s not really the story There are some excellent responses to your question in the thread 
Feminism,1615681389,I m definitely not saying men don t sexualize breasts But from my perspective I would say the people who sexualize breasts the most are the women I know  I m absolutely not saying that when a woman tries to look attractive in whatever way that she s automatically doing it for other people but of all the people I know the Ladies I know are the ones figuring out ways to make their breasts a sexy feature explicitly for others Contouring push up bras bra inserts water bras and actual breast surgeries that are cosmetic only  Again I don t think there is a single thing wrong if women want to do this but I do think that the people continuing and perpetuating the sexualization of breasts in the practical sense is SEEMINGLY women  I mean look at Victoria s Secret not much diversity and really not much size inclusion and I have only ever seen women in there as I walk by I don t have a comprehensive male perspective on this and I would definitely love it     On the subject of their practicality for breastfeeding only I believe human women are the only mammals that have very visible breasts outside of when they are lactating I m not sure how that can be used in arguments but it s a very very interesting subject 
Feminism,1615681065,I have   no clue what your point is You re saying that men sexualising breasts isnt the reason we can t be topless And then go on to make the point that the  real reason we can t be topless   is because young boys will sexualise our breasts     So you re making every single woman adapt their actions for the sake of a few immature boys who havent been taught to act appropriately around female breasts Do you not think that maybe allowing women to have their breasts out in public would work towards desexualising and normalising them so that boys don t see them as  magical  because they aren t magical they re ordinary secondary sex characteristics like facial hair  Also   idk where you live but in europe it s normal for both men and women to sunbathe topless and no one bats an eyelid 
Feminism,1615680674,Abridged origin In the roaring    s after WW and the spread of Ford s Model T car driving changed from a luxury to something increasingly accessible to the middle class When wealthy men or women displayed their wealth by owning a car that was considered fine When a middle class man went to work in his car that was considered fine But a middle class woman discovering new freedom in her car Can t have that that will both lower the prestige of car ownership and challenge the social norm of the stay at home wife And so those who didn t want either of the above but still wanted men to keep buying cars started this myth that women can t drive Even though women had been driving just fine before and after that 
Feminism,1615680658,i agree that person who i had in mind when i was typing this question seems to be very sensitive and unpleasant to be around 
Feminism,1615679841,I suppose as someone who spent a whole lot of my life predominantly around women I find them more approachable but I can t make any claims to niceness and virtue No individual human being can make that sort of judgement call IMO 
Feminism,1615679282,You want  little to do with women yet here you are offering your opinion in a sub about women s rights Huh  No need to reply to this comment I m a woman so you probably don t want to interact anyway right

Feminism,1615678901,As a man I d be quite happy with this outcome I think the genders should separate as much as possible 
Feminism,1615678332,What s your first thought when someone says that nice people of a particular gender are a rarity
Feminism,1615678058,I think surveys should also mention how frequently it happens It s not like it s happening to women once When I was a waitress it was daily

Feminism,1615677610,Please use the sidebar stickied post as we cover both of these topics on our wiki 
Feminism,1615677423,That s just plain wrong there are two genders It s called biology 
Feminism,1615676193,I thought this was in r askphilosophy when I first saw it This is the sort of thought experiment that s often used to tease out moral intuitions about consequentialism   specifically whether the girlfriend s  intentions matter in making a moral judgment about her actions or only their  in this case positive consequences or whether you think it is a problem that that she has benefitted from   moral luck    Personally I d say that her initial action of cheating was unethical for sure I think the boyfriend s differential attitude to her having extra relationship sex with women vs men is absolutely borne of societal misogyny but also his feelings are still his feelings If both of them are happy with the arrangement and she s being kind and caring to women she s seeing  and not trying to impose restrictions on who  they sleep with  I think the solution they come to is fine

Feminism,1615675130,The guns thing is interesting because in countries like the UK and Australia with extremely restrictive gun ownership you still see the strong disaparity in completion rates between men and women  and the availability of guns is just IMO a means to an end that fits men s attempts to find a permanent irreversible  way  of dying by suicide 
Feminism,1615674497,it really varies from feminist to feminist what they call it exactly for me it s bringing the patriarchy down
Feminism,1615674175,The woman is in my opinion the offender here Whilst the hypothetical guy didn t end up minding and let her do it again she still was unfaithful and should ve either not been unfaithful or discussed having something of an open relationship beforehand 
Feminism,1615673865,Wait aren t we saying the same thing Because I agree with you     
Feminism,1615673602,I think you two need to work on restoring trust and respect for each other before you worry about having sex Without trust there is no foundation to build a healthy relationship on 
Feminism,1615673587, gt dismatling the patriarchy and  gt harmony between the sexes are the same thing Not an either or 
Feminism,1615673437,I would disagree with this  Enthusiastic consent exists just fine but it s meant for new couples as a way to be ultra aware that they re not coercing or taking advantage of the other party  Once a relationship is well established sex does not need to have     enthusiastic consent all the time  But at that point you should have a level of communication and trust where you can be certain if they truly are consenting or not  If that level of trust is not there for you OP then yeah you should be revoking your own consent until it s back and you can be confident of her intentions The rest of it is more of a philosophical question than a feminist one   OP got a little lost in their own head I think and is really asking whether or not it s possible to completely trust someone to ever be completely honest with you  That s an understandable question too but I d rather keep ideas on consent specifically practical rather than philosophical 
Feminism,1615672857,Who made you video games gatekeeper dumbass    Also the only men who whine about women playing video games and harass them in game generally tend to be super bad at it themselves       Also galaxy brain thinking at equating FPS to video games  per se  
Feminism,1615672849,Women aren t the ones you hear screaming insults at each other for losing a game Go troll somewhere that people might put up with bullshit 
Feminism,1615672215,a The sexualisation is not intrinsic to body parts Note that in the same societies different parts get sexualised at different times and within different subcultures There are cultures where nudity and toplessness are completely normalised   the Victorians found ankles very arousing  and some people find feet arousing and I find nudity completely not arousing    b If what is sexually arousing is defined by whether you can give yourself certain neural responses then since people can get themselves off orgasms wouldn t be sexual or arousing  this absurdity should make you see the flaw in your logic     c Men sexualising breasts and having that institutionalised is  exactly why I cannot go topless I didn t have tits before I transitioned and now I do and them making them sexual and obscene is why I risk arrest in many parts of the world  They re just tits in most contexts 
Feminism,1615671718,A fascinating link to make is noticing that most cultures that made being topless illegal didn t do so until a religion enforced it   Another counterpoint a country that has communal public bathing Japan Women bathe naked with children Entire families bathe naked together There s nothing inherently sexual about the body it s about how you behave with your body or how others project their feelings about your body I grew up with family members frequently topless and I certainly was not traumatized by it Part of objectification is the mystification of it Ooo what s under the ladies blouse   Mystical magical breasts that we might get to touch if we get blessed What wondrous sights hidden from view When in reality as someone who goes to a women s only nude spa regularly breasts are pretty boring And I m sexually attracted to women They re just lumps of fat on the front of our chests They re lovely to play with but they re also no mystery Maybe young boys shouldn t be so ignorant of human biology 
Feminism,1615671578,No   I could imagine that feminist movements might become more demanding in the future and yes many women are angry at women who don t support women but this has never led to violence towards them 
Feminism,1615671540,If we grew up in an environment where breast aren t considered sexual and were out as much as male breast boys wouldn t freak out at a sight of female nipple Proof  look at countries where women s breast aren t a taboo 
Feminism,1615671250,I feel like the number is too low and the actual number is      A number of women are like me five years ago who though  come on I wasn t sexually harassed ever Boss demanding sex is sexual harassment I never experiences anything like that  What I did experience were men following me men exposing their genitalia men groping me on public transport men asking   year old me inappropriate questions men who were authority figures hugging me way too long and inappropriately men catcalling me men offering   year old me in school uniform a ride men kissing me without consent when I went to throw up on a train because I drank too much  I have multiple cases of full blown sexual assault yet my memory registered it as not a big deal and hilarious yet humiliating adventure  I think the truth is that     of women were sexually harassed and     of women were sexually assaulted I can t make up a situation where a woman isn t sexually harassed or assaulted even once in her entire life Maybe some wild child who lives with wolves and never seen people but I doubt she will be a participant in this questionnaire 
Feminism,1615670904,BDSM is an interesting one to explore there depending on what the partner was seeking it could easily be seen as entirely separate from their relationship or overlapping in ways that cross into the parts they feel should remain exclusive
Feminism,1615670830,the girlfriend didnt cheat because they guy gave her consent to be with the other girl the boyfriend is in the wrong for fetishising them 
Feminism,1615670628,The thing about breasts is that they re sexualized on women but they can be sexual for men to The only thing about a bigger chest on a woman is it is seen as scandelous Men are the ones who put this law into effect that women should hide their breasts and people don t teach children that breasts on women are normal If children are exposed to something from a young age that becomes their normal  There are some communities around the world that don t sexualize women s breasts and it is completely normal for them to go topless You have to look at certain things that men can do that women can t Taking off their shirt in a public setting being one of them 
Feminism,1615670565,Here s an exercise can you think of any part of your body that is treated the way we treat breasts  We don t usually choose to have breasts and they don t only show up when we re aroused When I m walking down the street going to work or at a beach with my kid or nursing a baby I m not being sexually suggestive Female bodies are not responsible for male reactions full stop men who have sexual thoughts about women are responsible for their own behavior and male children need to learn respect  You can think all the dirty thoughts you want about the breasts around you that s fine But that s a choice you are making I also love women and their bodies sexually  somehow I don t have an issue with nude breasts in public Just like people who menstruate learn to manage those symptoms people with higher testosterone are responsible for managing their own emotions 
Feminism,1615670455,Young boys have to be taught not to  objectivie women but you are basically objectifying women here Okay then 
Feminism,1615670359,Feminism is for equality usually that means getting rid of stereotypes standing up for people when they are wronged and really looking into systems and traditions that are damaging Whatever the outcome is is better than what we ve got now 
Feminism,1615670214,I think all around it s a pretty nasty scenario Firstly with the breaking of trust in a relationship Cheating is something that is important usually if it happens once then it happens again The woman cheating isn t alright but the boyfriend finding out then finding it  hot is pretty messed up too Not only is it fetishizing a relationship between two women It s also pretty clearly stating that he finds a woman less threatening than a man So he sees women s relationships as both  hot and not as valid as that of a man and woman Not to mention the other woman stayed when she found out that she was being used as a side partner and being sexualized People can do what they want but that is a whole bundle of issues I don t want anything to do with if it s real Yikes 
Feminism,1615669872,Thanks for responding and the clarity it makes sence It is hard to wrap my head arround it but this is something i can work with I really apreciate it 
Feminism,1615669819,The fundamentals of consent are broadly   Capacity of the person giving consent the person should be of sound mind not drunk high to the point of no control they should be old enough to give consent and they should be in a physical state to give consent whether verbal or by gestures   The mode of consent while it can be both gestures verbal it s important that the consent is fundamentally express i e given by their own volition it should be complete and not conditional   The consent should be free there should be no coercion manipulation fraud undue influence of power position mistake or misrepresentation in the way consent has been obtained There should be a meeting of the minds so to speak Every person involved should know clearly what is being consented and it should have no such coercive tactics in play making the consent free and absolute Sometimes the conditions can be such that although a person does not expressly say a verbal  no  due to influence power dynamics sexual dynamics personal history trauma etc it does not amount to a  yes either   Enthusiastic consent is term that is basically used to imply that instead of looking for a simple lack of  no there should be a presense of  yes  whether it is verbal or by gestures like positive body language When there is power imbalance coercion etc there will most likely be no express verbal consent and no positive gestural consent via body language emotional display etc While it s true people may not completely trust or even know each other consent on its own has nothing to do their interpersonal relationships history or even future Consent should not be seen has a reflection of people s lives or relationships as a whole consent should be seen as a fundamental part in every single sexual act that any people engage in whether they have known each other for one day or one entire lifetime So yes absolute consent exists 
Feminism,1615669670,They appear to be getting the    from the UN women s website which says   Only   of women aged      said they had not experienced sexual harassment  I can t find this figure after skimming the report but I believe the    figure is from asking women  have you experienced sexual harassment in a   public place   So I m assuming the    figure is from asking women  have you experienced sexual harassment   at all    although I admittedly cannot find this data in their report 
Feminism,1615693149,I see it like this  It seems like the best argument is politeness I care about being polite and putting people around me at a little bit of ease while also balancing my own ability to express and assert myself  I wont change my behavior because I think it s polite He doesn t care about politeness and putting people at ease I don t think that makes him a bad person since he s never actually assault anyone or harmed anyone  But he is my friend so I am a bit biased 
Feminism,1615693109,I m guessing that bison is the  friend from his story he is doing nothing but defending his  friend s bad behavior 
Feminism,1615693072,I think it is misogyny and anti feminist It s clearly aimed at women and it s clearly meant to shut them up There is nothing more patriarchal than shutting up women 
Feminism,1615692956,He IS a danger if he s spreading his bigotry and refusing to treat others as human beings of value What he does makes others justify their own bigotry and ignorance 
Feminism,1615692954,If my friends were in the situation I would stay out of it and not judge them Obviously the cheating woman confessed and the boyfriend forgave her and they are both happy Also I am bisexual and to be honest there is something different about sleeping with a man versus sleeping with a woman as it appeals to different parts of me and my sexuality I m not trying to say that cheating is OK but that instead people may perceive their own sexual experiences with men or women differently and I m not going to claim that the boyfriend is fetishizing because of it 
Feminism,1615692884,Tell me how you see it then because from your comments I think you are making a lot of excuses for him because he s your friend Simply because he s a friend to you doesn t make him a good person You need to be real with yourself on that 
Feminism,1615692747,Nah he s been my best friend since I was like  and we re really really close I ll call him out but dropping is extreme 
Feminism,1615692697,Plus they forget to mention that those men are victims of other men Most crimes against men and women are committed by MEN    Any time I hear someone using that argument it s always used as a justification of that person s bigotry 
Feminism,1615692696,Nobody  at least not in this thread is asking him to apologize 
Feminism,1615692694, gt Yeah I imagine nothing will convince him because he s self centered and isn t a feminist And a lot of women do get professional help that doesn t change the perceived sense of danger especially when we ve been told all our lives to change our behavior to be safe Don t drink too much don t wear revealing clothes don t be out late etc We hear that from childhood on throughout our lives and when women experience violence they are often blamed for it If he can t wrap his brain around that he s probably a lost cause I wouldn t want to be friends with someone like that I think this is an interesting case If we stop telling women to fear men in order to be safe would the fear go away  It seems like the fear is based in perceived extent of harm  fear of escalation violence and impact  rather than the frequency So even if it almost never happened the perceived fear would likely not change Like the driving vs airplane analogy Deaths from driving are more frequent but if you get into a car crash some people might survive An airplane crashes less frequently but when it does it s catastrophic  Sorry if this is an insensitive way of thinking It s just something I m curious about 
Feminism,1615692575,If I m honest he doesn t sound like a nice person He sounds like a person who is good to people he likes He clearly doesn t give a crap about how he affects other people aka women strangers 
Feminism,1615692349,Sounds like your friend is quite the sexist and is unwilling to educate himself about the oppression and discrimination women have had to face he has no empathy to even think of someone else besides himself and people like him  misogynists     Some people will insist on defending their bigotry no matter what and it s not worth the effort His comments like  statistically safer to be a woman than a man is proof of this Most crimes perpetrated against women are by men and most crimes perpetrated against men are by men That s statistically correct Throughout history men have oppressed and made women feel unsafe hell until a couple of decades ago it was still legal to rape your wife and still is legal in some countries Women have so much to be afraid of thanks to men yet your friend feels that as a male he has no responsibility to help rectify the wrongs of the past   Drop this friend he s not worth your time Rather make friends with good people who care about others People who fight against sexism racism homophobia etc This friend of yours is so ignorant and against treating others with kindness just imagine how badly he will treat you when you need help You don t need to keep trash like that around 
Feminism,1615691890,I don t count catcalling as sexual assault either I m certainly not saying catcalling is as bad as mugging My point was that I have no way to know which catcaller will escalate to something more And the original question was about why men should care Catcalling is already unpleasant and disrespectful on its own even if I could be sure that s all it is Things don t have to be life or death to provoke bad feelings and if you have any empathy at all you might care about that 
Feminism,1615691768,You know there exists a kind of bisexuality where one seeks romance from lets say men and sexual feelings from women In this kind of situation it s totally understandable that men are seen as threats because they might replace the husband but women are not because the wife doesn t find women attractive in a romantic way 
Feminism,1615691527,Look up Emmet Till Not too long ago if you were a young Black man who didn t bow his head and look down when passing a white woman you could wind up at the bottom of a river When your very existence makes someone uncomfortable what do you do Just die   Look up the Tulsa race massacre Because white women didn t feel safe  after an alleged r pe by a Black man on a white woman  a whole thriving Black community was bombed and hundreds of people killed their bodies thrown into the river   Why do we fear the man and not those who lynch him 
Feminism,1615691291,Yeah I imagine nothing will convince him because he s self centered and isn t a feminist  And a lot of women do get professional help that doesn t change the perceived sense of danger especially when we ve been told all our lives to change our behavior to be safe Don t drink too much don t wear revealing clothes don t be out late etc We hear that from childhood on throughout our lives and when women experience violence they are often blamed for it  If he can t wrap his brain around that he s probably a lost cause I wouldn t want to be friends with someone like that 
Feminism,1615691225,It s a shit world we live in if men need to start apologizing for perfectly normal and neutral stuff like walking on a street 
Feminism,1615691052,Sexual assault is such a broad category it s not correct to compare everything from catcalling to rape against mugging 
Feminism,1615691005,Other people have already covered that it s the kind and caring thing to do  and if you have to explain why kind and caring and good traits then your friend has serious issues but I want to touch on your male privilege  You benefit from being  and presenting as cis men It s this privilege that allows your friend to be so selfish  he genuinely feels he is entitled to live his life like that without actively working towards improving the quality of life for others  By taking action and consciously making space for women to feel safe you are contesting that privilege extending your empathy muscles and showing that you value women s feelings and recognise their reality These are all valuable traits especially because it means you have to go back on the conditioning we receive to isolate men and women  from both themselves and each other   So thank you for taking the time to consider both how women feel and how your presence  as well intentioned as one may be could affect them and or their sense of safety Your friend is being selfish and short sighted and by refusing to take accountability for his privilege he is further contributing to a culture that intimidates and dismisses women 
Feminism,1615690990,The reason people generally write trans women with a space between  trans and  women is that  trans is an adjective describing  women  like saying  tall women or  blonde women  Trans women are women 
Feminism,1615690981,Not only is it common courtesy but there s a ton of studies about how when everyone feels safe and able to share their voice then companies communities thrive It s long and I don t have the sources atm  I m on mobile but it s a pretty interesting argument It s the same reason why I care about the education of the people I ve never met or why third world countries deserve clean water food education and better lives We care about other people because when one of us thrives we all thrive 
Feminism,1615690885,Are you implying that rape and violence are getting more common Source please 
Feminism,1615690702,Oh ok good answer It won t convince him because he believes it not his fault women have this fear He believes that they should seek professional help if they have this fear 
Feminism,1615690672,Did you not frame his view as  why should I care how she feels  
Feminism,1615690650,I said   I   I didn t say a thing about men not being victims of assault such as rape and sexual harassment  I fail to see how men in the daily basis fear rape as women do Fear being sexually harassed and being catcalled as women do Fear being blame for their own assault as women do But although I  fail to see I don t claim it as the ultimate truth 
Feminism,1615690570,Do you only ever do things if they entirely benefit you Do you think the few seconds you re sacrificing add up to anything substantial  Check your phone See if you ve gotten an email or a text That s literally enough time to create significant distance You re gonna do it at some point anyway  When you think about it for a minute it really isn t a big ask So just do it 
Feminism,1615690419,Or you could stop for   seconds to check your phone to let her move ahead which is my husband s move  A few seconds is not a cost and your other comment about it not directly benefitting you makes me wonder what is your intention with it anyway With that statement it sounds like you do this for  nice guy points and not because you genuinely care about the women s perceived sense of safety Maybe that s why you can t come up with a solid response to your friend  amp  x   B At the end of the day we are a community of people To be good people we do things that benefit others not because it benefits us but because it is a good thing to do especially when it costs you nothing or next to nothing  amp  x   B Speaking as a therapist perceived safety is a very real experience that affects mental health Women live in a state of toxic stress and hypervigilance If you can take   seconds to help lessen that you are providing a net positive benefit for your community If you are hung up on yourself then you are selfish 
Feminism,1615690407,Guess you can t really do much with someone who s perspective is  why should I give a fuck about others  
Feminism,1615690297,Lol I think he would disagree  But      I dont think I ll be able to change his mind with any of these arguments
Feminism,1615690244,Men also fear their bodies being violated  Your comment framed it as being  getting groped or raped vs getting robbed and that s a  massive oversimplification of male victimization 
Feminism,1615690185,I can definitely understand that but I m concerned about the fact that he s arguing with you on this As a woman it s not sounding reassuring Lol 
Feminism,1615690098,He s a pretty cool guy But he s pretty goal oriented and focused so doing these things don t really occur to him 
Feminism,1615690050,The stats did not exclude sexual assault and rape It just said that that s the only type of crime that are have higher female victimization than male   gt The part of you pointed sums perfectly the different between being a man and a woman in society  gt Woman fear for their bodies being assaulted groped and raped way more than they care about being robbed I d rather be robbed      times than be groped and abused Your friend clearly lacks knowledge on the context of this data and what they represent The problem is that getting robbed is not the online crime outside of sexual assault and rape So this argument isn t very good 
Feminism,1615690011,Fair enough on the sociopath remark consider it retracted I was debating including it Time and effort to make others feel safe and comfortable is no real cost at all as far as I m concerned 
Feminism,1615689920,Ye not a big fan of throwing around words like that because it demonizes those who are actually diagnosed with sociopathy  He said that it would cost him time and effort to do that he sees no real benefit in doing  Idk don t think I can change his mind
Feminism,1615689880,Margaret Atwood did say she didnt write anything in it that hasnt happened at some point 
Feminism,1615689829,   Your own comment man The link you gave and quoted shows that the stats  excluded sexual assault and rape 
Feminism,1615689821,I suppose that s the more tactful way to put it but I don t have much patience for guys like that Good luck 
Feminism,1615689747,Ok I see But yeah I won t say it s a decent person thing I ll just tell him it s a matter of being nice 
Feminism,1615689745,Whenever I hear arguments in favour of covering up the human body because  insert body part is inherently sexual I think of three things First no body part is inherently sexual even sexual organs They are sexual in a sexual setting but outside of that they are just another body part Is washing your genitals sexual Not unless you make it Peeing Not unless you are a into that and b it s already a sexual situation Is scratching your genitals because they itch sexual Nope sometimes they just itch Teenagers get hardons out of nowhere in public in the middle of the day and that s not even sexual It just happens Puritanical views if the body has reduced them to their sexual function but they are not solely sexual They become sexual Second I think of nudism People are literally fully naked in front of each other all day and it s not a constant orgy and children are not scarred by seeing naked people around them Nudist colonies are only awkward if people make it sexual  i e creeps  Not to say it is impossible for nudism to be problematic but in and of itself being naked isn t even sexual It s hiding bodies that make them so enticing when they are revealed And I m saying that as someone who does not partake in that lifestyle at all And third can men s nipples be sexual They can be A LOT of men like their nipples played with during intimacy yet we don t freak out over men s nipples Ask yourself this question why can men s breasts sometimes be sexual but women s breast are seen as always sexual 
Feminism,1615689706,Your friend sounds kind of sociopathic If you re an empathetic person you consider the well being of others in the shared spaces you occupy It doesn t cost anything to be courteous but it can help others a whole damn lot 
Feminism,1615689700,Eh it s more of a personal thing I guess Crossing the street does cost me things sometimes It takes longer to reach my destination and it gives me a bit of anxiety 
Feminism,1615689610,I mean it doesn t cost  nothing  It costs some time and doesn t entirely benefit me when I do it but it seems polite 
Feminism,1615689550,He s a nice person for the most part but he s not really privy to every social cue I like him and this doesn t particularly do much to his character for me  I don t think he cares much about the victim hood olympics as you say I think it s more about not doing anything that would inconvenience himself because he s not inherently a danger  or at least he doesn t see himself that way  
Feminism,1615689348,Violent crime is an assault against bodily autonomy This includes armed robbery assault battery rape murder etc I m not sure this argument holds much water
Feminism,1615689296,Harmony and Equality between the sexes is it for me but you cant do that without dismantling the patriarchy 
Feminism,1615689269,I think the difference is that stalking is an intentional invasion of privacy  or at least an attempt at one which inherently makes the other person unsafe My friend was talking about not changing his behavior in public and inconveniencing himself to make women feel safer 
Feminism,1615689199,You just care because you re not an asshole It s really that simple Yes men are more likely to be murdered but are less likely to be sexually assaulted and in all cases men are more likely to be perpetrators than women and we re less physically capable of dealing with that situation Just tell him it s a matter of being a decent person 
Feminism,1615689124,I think I agree with this sentiment It s just a politeness thing and isn t really doing any harm to anyone else 
Feminism,1615689078,Yes they are This is only a continuous debate with people who hold ignorant views and lack of understanding about transgender folks 
Feminism,1615688991, gt Are you gonna care more for this random dude Be worried about his safety on the of chance a muging happens Are you gonna watch over him to make sure he is not distracted and warn him of any impending attacks or anything like that Or are you most likely gonna continue on your way If I feel safe enough to speak if something falls off of his pockets I ll more likely warn In the reality I ll acknowledge his consideration in my head and appreciate the effort he made to make me feel less endangered   gt Conversely if OPs friend was walking behind you literally not giving a fuck about you and if you notice a man with a knife going to rush him are you saying that you wouldn t even try to warn him and just run away If you do that notice how immediate moraly speaking you loose out on the  deserve to feel safe status If not giving a fuck about me is not getting close to me in a creepy way and minding his business then he s doing fine If anyone was gonna be attacked in front of me regardless I d probably scream to warn it  I think you re stretching what consideration is this context  I said if OP s friend showed lack of empathy and consideration for my fear I d be inconsiderate to him as a friend colleague I won t give a fuck anymore about how he s feeling what he s dealing with etc This is the scenario I made 
Feminism,1615688908,Just as safe but also less anxious and afraid which to me is worth at least something 
Feminism,1615688660,It s literally not that much of an inconvenience for you to walk across the road to make a women feel a little more safer Even if you know you re not going to do something to her she doesn t it s not that difficult to just make her feel a little more safe Even if you don t feel like  accommodating for someone else s needs it s not like a hard thing to do at all just be a good person brother that s all 
Feminism,1615688656,Next step I d say would be for you to be openly pro feminism to your guy friends If the topic never comes up find a way to bring it up Exemplify and normalize men supporting and believing women 
Feminism,1615688576,Yes I recently showed some other online ignorant this exact context of crime data Men who use this  argument are clearly just hiding their lack of empathy and logical thinking 
Feminism,1615688487, gt I m not implying anything I m saying the obvious    How does that work out in real life You are walking down a street with OP behind you And OP wanting you to feel safe does something ie he talks on his phone to his mom stops to tie shoelaces of his velcro sneakers whatever  Are you gonna care more for this random dude Be worried about his safety on the of chance a muging happens Are you gonna watch over him to make sure he is not distracted and warn him of any impending attacks or anything like that Or are you most likely gonna continue on your way    Conversely if OPs friend was walking behind you literally not giving a fuck about you and if you notice a man with a knife going to rush him are you saying that you wouldn t even try to warn him and just run away If you do that notice how immediate moraly speaking you loose out on the  deserve to feel safe status     gt I don t know about you but I believe that kindness generate kindness AAcknowledged kindness generated kindness Kindness done is general without the beneficent part being aware of the benefactor is pointless if the goal is to receive kindness That s not to say you shouldn t do it but receiving kindness should be the goal Good things should be done because it is right to do so and no other reason     gt If this man was inconsiderate to me when I expressed this fear of walking alone at night I d be inconsiderate to him in return    Oh   so this is a social setting So not the situation at hand of walking around at night 
Feminism,1615688425,Please respect out top level comment rule which states that all top level comments must come from feminists and must reflect a feminist perspective Non feminists may only participate in nested comments Comment this is your last warning 
Feminism,1615688346,Yeah off the top of my head men are more likely to be victims of non sexual crimes and they also are killed at greater rates in war situations  obviously  Women are more likely to be raped sexually assaulted and harassed And also women are more like to be abused and murdered by their spouse Men that use their argument are technically wrong however they are showing themselves to be uneducated in how to appropriately use statistics in a debate Yeah men get killed at a higher rate because of a variety of situations but they are rarely killed because of their gender sex etc The fact that he used this as an excuse is pretty shitty of him in my opinion 
Feminism,1615688264,If I threw a bunch of harmless spiders at a person deathly scared of spiders would they be actually less safe than if I didn t No but everyone would consider me a huge asshole and for good reason And from a purely logical perspective women have a much better reason to be scared 
Feminism,1615687978,I don t think that acknowledging different people fulfilling different sexual roles inherently denotes one of those roles as lesser than another it s just true that there are differences between sex with different kinds of people independent of any value judgement on those differences and I think it s natural for people to be more inclined towards jealousy when they see someone performing a role more similar to theirs Obviously I d ideally rather there be no roles either I m a non binary genderfluid person who was assigned male at birth and is indeed tired of the ways in which society has punished me for not fitting their perceived standards of what someone with my body type should be  act like and I m not trying to impose any such standards on anyone else I m just saying in general this goes for all areas of life it makes sense for people to be more inclined to experience jealousy and resentment towards those who remind them more of themselves in the same way that people are more likely to compare themselves those who work in their own field than someone who works in a different field  It is true that there are differences when having sex with different kinds of people and to me it is valid for people to experience more insecurity over the idea of their partner sleeping with someone who reminds them more of themself than someone who doesn t because in the case of the person who resembles them more there is a greater fear of that person replacing them  I personally know this fear well my ex also trans but was closeted at the time as was I put relentless pressure on me to be a traditionally hyper masculine man and ultimately cheated on me with someone he decided fit this role better who incidentally also assaulted me During this relationship I was justifiably more threatened by his affections towards men than any other gender although my ex was pan because that was the demographic he placed the heaviest emphasis on comparing me to and that being more afraid of get cheated on by someone you perceive as more like yourself doesn t inherently denote any sense of disdain towards those who are more different from yourself 
Feminism,1615687893,I mean that s her personal experience and there s nothing beyond that 
Feminism,1615687869,Yes I am To clarify breasts are great I m a woman and I m bisexual so I enjoy them in different ways Breasts have a lot of uses and they re pretty cool However their only official function is breastfeeding 
Feminism,1615687819,I don t think that acknowledging different people fulfilling different sexual roles inherently denotes one of those roles as lesser than another it s just true that their are differences between sex with different kinds of people independent of any value judgement on those differences and I think it s natural for people to be more inclined towards jealousy when they see someone performing a role more similar to theirs Obviously I d ideally rather there be no roles either I m a non binary genderfluid person who was assigned male at birth and is indeed tired of the ways in which society has punished me for not fitting their perceived standards of what someone with my body type should be  act like and I m not trying to impose any such standards on anyone else I m just saying in general this goes for all areas of life it makes sense for people to be more inclined to experience jealousy and resentment towards those who remind them more of themselves people are more likely to compare themselves those who work in their own field than someone who works in as a different field It is true that there are differences when having sex with different kinds of people and to me it is valid for people to experience more insecurity over the idea of their partner sleeping with someone who reminds them more of themself than someone who doesn t because in the case of the person who resembles them more there is a greater fear of that person replacing them  I personally know this fear well my ex also trans put relentless pressure on me to be a traditionally hyper masculine man and ultimately cheated on me with someone he decided for this role better who incidentally also assaulted me During this relationship I was justifiably more threatened by his affections towards men although my ex was pan because that was the demographic he placed the heaviest emphasis on comparing me to and that being more afraid of get cheated on by someone you perceive as more like yourself doesn t inherently denote any sense of disdain towards those who are different from yourself 
Feminism,1615687756,Rephrase that to why should men care about women or anybody for that matter And statistically everybody is significantly more in danger from men the difference is men have more power over that dynamic 
Feminism,1615687720,Interesting I don t necessarily see your situation as  politeness  It would occur to me as a character trait Given that the person s actual safety is the same if you re doing it because it s the societally expected thing to do then whatever  Do it or don t do it you don t owe anybody anything  If you re not unsafe you shouldn t HAVE to go out of your way But if you re doing it because you care about a stranger s comfort that s a whole other tomato   Good character or not everybody has their own convictions We just have to figure out ours and not give a shit what other people think of them right 
Feminism,1615687719,I m not implying anything  I m saying the obvious  I don t know about you but I believe that kindness generate kindness If this man was inconsiderate to me when I expressed this fear of walking alone at night I d be inconsiderate to him in return Otherwise I try to be empathic and kind to people 
Feminism,1615687671, gt walking at night is safer as a woman than for a man yet women tend to report more fear  There s a lot to unpack there but there are a few immediate problems with using this as the basis for changing your behavior   The fact that women report more fear may be what s driving them to avoid situations that would make them victims of violent crime If women are more cautious their lower representation in crime statistics makes sense    Women are manifestly harassed more often in public than men in terms of stalking cat calling etc Basically every woman reports having had these experiences usually often So fearing men following them  and potentially escalating into harassment is totally rational Women are almost certainly more likely to be harassed randomly than men are to be victims of random crime    Notoriously female victims of sexual assault are often distrusted and even blamed   male victims of robbery not so much So women may feel they lack a kind of safety net  police support from acquaintances afterwards that men take for granted 
Feminism,1615687615,That s missing the point though I m not only scared of being physically assaulted walking home alone at night I m also fearful of catcalling being followed that some creep may make a note of my address etc Also I ve been robbed once and it sucked obviously but it did not impact my life I ve been raped twice and will probably be in therapy for the rest of my life You can t compare apples and asparagus and say see isn t the asparagus more oppressed than the apple They re completely different and face completely different problems 
Feminism,1615687201, gt He can not care But people will also not care for him    It s not a if  then  else statement People don t care for him regardless of whether or not he cares for others That s the experience he draws from or are you implying that you would care more about him if he tried to make women safer Or that you care fur OP because he makes women feel safer    Is that a metric I can use Should I care more for the safety of a a female acquaintance who takes part in environmental drives food kitchens etc as opposed to someone whose only contribution to society is that she works for big tobacco     gt Women don t ask much they ask appropriate behavior from men If OP s friend isn t doing anything intentionally disturbing he s decent If he thinks he should not care about women that s fine he can But it does make him sound like a utter idiot pretending that men suffer more and similar     I think indifference is adequate behavior in part because it is the norm      gt I walk across a parking lot in the daylight and pray to whatever fuck is in the sky that no men even talks to me The world is not the same for men and women Not in the day not in the night    That we can agree 
Feminism,1615687197,The questions generally not This is r AskFeminists not r DeradicalizeFeministsViaTheBrillianceOfYourLeadingQuestion I ve learned refined my opinions as a result of some of the discussion in the comments but it s pretty obvious when an OP is  asking a question that is really meant to be an anti feminist gotcha and those are not generally the type of  question that gets a lot of interesting engagement 
Feminism,1615687192,That men are victims of more  types of crime means nothing at all For example if  men were murdered  men assaulted  men robed and   women were sexually assaulted women still experience twice as much violence than men If you want to actually do a real comparison you will also have to consider multiple factors For example are men  being less scared than women more often walk alone  in unsafe areas How much of a factor is it that men make up for the huge majority of gang members  criminals in general Are men more likely to try start fights Etc etc I don t know the answers to these questions but they re very important if you want to know who s statistically more likely to be a victim of a violent crime  based on their gender alone  
Feminism,1615687180,I d rather be a victim of violent crime than rape or sexual abuse And in any case I m sure they re not considering domestic violence in this statistic 
Feminism,1615687147,Sure you re not responsible You  can be a kind person and make someone comfortable when it takes no effort on your part though I also cross the street and generally avoid women at night  it costs me literally nothing and if it makes them feel better that s great and I m happy I could make someone s life a little less shit Why is this so hard to understand 
Feminism,1615687122, gt he doesn t feel that his specific role of penis wielder is being replaced she may be sleeping with someone else but she isn t riding someone else s dick That is the whole problem That world view depends on putting all women in their own sperate class which apparently stands below  penis wieder  That not only devalues the sex between women that devalues women Besides it is also just inaccurate with the right tools and toys anyone of any gender can be a penis wielder 
Feminism,1615687056,So if a woman  and a feminist says VERY FEW men are genuine nice guys what s your thought That shes the main denominator 
Feminism,1615686961,Why exclude sexual assault though Is that not sufficiently awful to make us afraid Is getting literally murdered the only thing I should be afraid of I could experience anything from mild harassment to rape to kidnapping to murder The milder things are more likely but I still would prefer to not have them happen on a given outing And if someone is mildly harassing me I have no way of knowing how far they ll escalate That puts me more on edge than I would be if I could be certain that there would be no escalation I can t have that certainty so I have no choice but to take every situation seriously 
Feminism,1615686805,It s common sense that every claim should be investigated But to call every person who doesn t have evidence a liar knowing that there s a higher chance of them telling the truth due to how rare false accusations are is the dumbest shit ever Just because someone is found innocent in the court doesn t mean they re actually innocent Just like you people bitch about innocent people in jail there s an army of rapists walking free just because they know they can always claim it s hearsay if they get lucky 
Feminism,1615686711,You have the right to do that  As OP s friend has the right to not be considerate  He can not care But people will also not care for him  Women don t ask much they ask appropriate behavior from men If OP s friend isn t doing anything intentionally disturbing he s decent If he thinks he should not care about women that s fine he can But it does make him sound like a utter idiot pretending that men suffer more and similar  I walk across a parking lot in the daylight and pray to whatever fuck is in the sky that no men even talks to me The world is not the same for men and women Not in the day not in the night 
Feminism,1615686584,In particular when a heterosexual person believes that members of the opposite gender are awful it s probably because they ve put themselves in a position to be hurt by members of that gender rather than their own E g people of both genders will cheat on their partners but a straight woman can only have the experience of being cheated on by a man so in her experience men will likely have been worse to her than women 
Feminism,1615686306,Yuuup The right love to co opt useful concepts and twist overuse them until they are no longer fit for their original purpose It sucks because it is valuable and necessary to label highlight and discuss the racism of white women but one of the tools that women of color developed in order to draw attention to that discussion has been turned into a misogynist dog whistle for any insufficiently subservient woman For another example I remember when reality based media was becoming concerned about the rise of fact deficient rightwing propaganda the term everyone started using was  fake news  Then you know who got a hold of that term and suddenly nothing is true and everything is permitted 
Feminism,1615686304,I think the key thing here is that  safety is a strange standard for what could be considered acceptable behaviour We could easily imagine an alternative situation where instead of coincidentally heading the same way a man has decided to actively follow after a woman walking home in the dark for whatever reason  maybe he s seen her around and is curious where she lives Let s also say that he has no intentions of doing anything or even approaching her i e he s not actually  dangerous  In such a situation we can easily say that she is in fact still perfectly  safe  But just about anyone would still recognize this behaviour as completely fucked up Because she has no way of knowing his intentions and because the distress it would cause is already harmful all by itself regardless of safety 
Feminism,1615686126,Damn after reading this I think women should have free pads tampons I was gonna say they shouldn t be taxed cuz u need them Decent ones are fucking expensive Being broke and finding a pack of   pads for  dollars saved my life once Unless u wanna see my bloody mess   should be free
Feminism,1615685911,We are socialized to respond how we are treated it s a rare few who treat others better than we have been treated The friend is drawing from his past of no one giving a shit about him and applying it blanket for all humanity It s like the confusion I feel when hearing people say women ought to feel safe at night      and I think no    no one should feel safe at night that s when security is lax and criminal activities begin Going out at that hour is a risk for everyone you should feel scared    I walk very silently and quickly there have been atleast  instances where someone really wigged out as I passed them I don t stop I don t check to see if they are OK I don t reassure I just keep walking rapidly out pacing them Perhaps that s reassuring to them because it implies that my focus is not on them I just behave like the world is a free range with genderless meat shaped obstacles all around me that I must navigate around Surely that s enough
Feminism,1615685807,The part of you pointed sums perfectly the different between being a man and a woman in society  Woman fear for their bodies being assaulted groped and raped way more than they care about being robbed I d rather be robbed      times than be groped and abused Your friend clearly lacks knowledge on the context of this data and what they represent 
Feminism,1615718001,All  top level comments   in any thread must be given by feminists and must reflect a feminist perspective Please refrain from posting further direct answers here  comment 
Feminism,1615717951,Yes there are some thoughts that might sound sexist but it doesn t sound like they come from a general sexist attitude You have intrusive thoughts that try to explain it  these don t come out of nowhere though we re still in a patriarchy  They might vanish with the insecurities Everyone thinks they re  less than sometimes and judge themselves much more harshly than others probably do  As a teenager and young adult I was insecure about my small boobs and thought dudes would think less of me because of them It s pretty deprecating I m older now and that thought never returned in like   years 
Feminism,1615717447,I do think there is a huge beauty bias in the world If I hang out with a handsome partner that reflects well on me it gives me more perceived status and success Society tells me that having this status is very important We are also bombarded with messages that tell us value lies in appearance I definitely think you can be a feminist while being very critical of and struggling with the beauty bias in the world  But I can also see that it can feel unfair and make you cynical I think the biggest flaw I see in your internalized logic is the idea that people are interchangeable Your reasoning sounds like Your personality is worth   points and the other guys is also worth   points But his face is more symmetrical and so women will choose the other guy  or dump you when they can find a guy with a better calculated value  That argument is very reductionist  it leaves out a lot of real life details You could compare it to a large scale research study But to apply it to yourself also reduces you it becomes a kind of self objectification It reduces you from a real life person with hopes interests passions and aspirations to  a carrier of value  That also encourages you to objectify other people in the same way I think the best way to step out of that system is to take steps to improve your own self esteem and self love Not because hot chicks will automatically slide into your DMs after that But because it allows to you step outside of a system of objectification in which happiness is highly conditional and hard to attain and keep Good luck 
Feminism,1615717199,Yes they are body issues But I somehow felt it could be some subconscious misogyny Because the fear that a woman I am dating might leave me for  better men where better means someone taller or someone who is richer etc This kind of belief in incel ish because it supports hypergamy that incels swear by I firmly believe that most women are not like that and wanted to challenge those beliefs That s why I posted here What you said is absolutely useful though Most of my closest friends are women of my age While most of them do like conventionally attractive men they are in loving relationships with men of different shapes and sizes They also encourage me to ask someone I like out which I never did  this is a body issue again because I felt I am too unattractive to date   I also am taking therapy which probed to be very useful It was not initially for body image issues but I am going to talk about them in my next session 
Feminism,1615716950,This  My last serious LTR was with a post op  I normally think it s tacky to mention but it s relevant here trans woman We also had a  no other men agreement  One day she cheated with a trans guy As hard as it was I had to leave her She actually had the nerve to try talking her way out of it  So yeah similar role is a very important detail It s not just about the penis for a lot of us  I hope this adds to the discussion in some way Thanks 
Feminism,1615716814,Just my  cents from reading a bunch of a b o but omegaverse fic doesn t have to be misogynistic  or misandric  Often it can be pretty feminist in tone by subverting the trope i e having the omegas betas and alphas fight against the societal hierarchy Yes there are obvious parallels between gender and the patriarchy but they re not necessarily condoning of gender roles or the  rule of alphas On AO there s actually a tag for subverted abo I like to think of ABO as a philosophical query or a thought empathy experiment I find it interesting 
Feminism,1615716339,Internalised misogyny describes women accepting the devaluation of women as valid So this is a term for women not men What you describe sounds more like a body issue than sexism You re insecure about yourself and your worth and reactions from other people make it worse You re at an age where validation from a peer group is important so this can lead to some damage and anxiety You should try to find a group of people who you trust and who support you If this is really weighing on you you should seek counseling 
Feminism,1615716203, gt You think you re describing a feeling something that resides inside an individual But we re trying to tell you it s not just how women see the world it s a reality that affects half of the population in a specific way at the hands of the other half of the population    I hear you And I am saying it s both    We are living in a time that is virtually the safest in recorded human history And yet if you ask a woman from   years ago vs a woman today they are gonna tell you that they feel unsafe    It s a reality perceived by one half of the population by the bad acting members of the other half Members that the other half fears too by the way           gt Women are telling you that they feel unsafe You say you see women feeling unnecessarily unsafe Why wont you take women at their word and accept that what they feel reflects reality     Because it doesn t Because to accept them at their word requires me to see the other half of the population as predators or as schrodingers rapists I am a person who doesn t even see people as schrodingers theives     gt What you consider idealistic  changing norms and realistic  women gaining agency is only your opinion What many communities have made possible is the former and people who have privilege only ever really consider the latter because the latter doesn t require relinquishing some privilege    Have you ever considered the fact that you asking for help   no demanding that we change the way we do things in our daily lives to make strangers feel safer comes across to the half that you are describing as entitled    Violence defines the world we inhabit It colors everything from our friendships to our enemities to even how we need to deal with assholes in traffic We have learnt to live with a constant low level of anxiety with a constant low level of threat hanging over our heads that s the price of our freedom You can have it too No one made concessions or tried to make us feel safer or welcomed  The world is a hostile place  that s our reality    And on top of that many women expect us to do more to help them feel safer not only simply things like crossing the road or make ourselves less threatening than we are   which is all very doable But then they also expect us to do things like speak up when cat calling or everlasting occurs    Do they not consider that by doing so we subject ourselves to the possibility of an escalation Eveteasers are assholes but they are unlikely to escalate to groping women how ever what do you think happens when a     Manlet calls them out on it Don t you think they are liable to feel emasculated and required to retaliate with physical force to regain it    As a group women feel entitled to feel safe to ask the other half of the population to help them but I am not gonna help them until the stakes are high enough for me to try and help  the lack of my help leading to assault or rape  do you know why  Because men deserve to to feel safe too but we know that we are only as safe as we make ourselves    It was a huge point of contention for a post on r menslib I recommend reading it The users there make this point a while lot better than I am able to    I am a     guy which is midling in my country I am stronger than I look but even so I am not gonna interfere with an eveteading incident because off the top of my head I know of  instances over the last month where a man was assaulted for protesting  one stabed with a knife  he died     If I see a crime in progress a physical one I will intervene or atleast call the cops  but other than that I would do nothing If someone does less than that ie doesn t involve himself for fear of life and limb I won t judge him 
Feminism,1615716017,Oh cool I am new to the terms Thanks for clarifying 
Feminism,1615715766,The starting point of feminism is in fact that a patriarchal power structure exists The very concept of which is that women are in a system that strips them of power and gives men more power over them Quite naturally the in group has more power than the out group to control the social dynamic 
Feminism,1615715684,Yea I suppose But yours isn t outright misogyny It s more subconcious Internalised misogygny is a term generally used for women who project sexist beliefs about women on themselves and on other women
Feminism,1615715213,Maybe I must have used another term I want to challenge these beliefs I am not really sure what to call them Maybe it is just misogyny 
Feminism,1615715080,Doesn t  internalized misogyny refer to a woman who holds sexist views against her own gender
Feminism,1615714915,I am not having a hard time seeing what sparked my insecurity I am having a hard time challenging that insecurity and seeing from a different perspective Just answer this one question would you not date a woman simply because she does not have some conventionally attractive trait but an otherwise amazing woman If you don t then won t that make you shallow Do you think that no man dates a woman who does not meet the criteria that you attest as  perfect  I told this multiple times humans are complicated They have a wide range of preferences or qualities they are attracted to  In a way you actually helped me Because I needed to formulate arguments against you who believes in all the things I want to challenge One person s meat is another person s poison There is no arbitrary standard of attraction Different people find different things attractive I can confirm that from personal experience 
Feminism,1615714119,You seem pretty level headed Having a difficult time seeing what sparked the insecurity 
Feminism,1615713434,A quick look at the study shows that it is very badly designed As I mentioned attraction has many facets Without taking those into consideration I don t think we can get comprehensive results The study only included penis models not humans Don t you think that there would have been different results if there was a guy attached to that penis There could many influences then For example a woman might have a strong attraction to certain physical features and that person might have a smaller penis Do you think that the woman will now choose that guy just because of the penis Don t you think that results may be even varied if you gave descriptions of each guy Say like one guy might have a massive penis in the picture but is described to touch women inappropriately Wouldn t that influence the result The point is men are not walking dildo and have various traits and personalities Women are not hivemind and different environments breed attraction to different traits and qualities Whether these particular researchers believe it or not there are many studies that concluded that there is a strong social factor to attraction And people are beyond their penises and vaginas so attraction can vary 
Feminism,1615713396,You think you re describing a feeling something that resides inside an individual But we re trying to tell you it s not just how women see the world it s a reality that affects half of the population in a specific way at the hands of the other half of the population  Women are telling you that they feel unsafe You say you see women feeling unnecessarily unsafe  Why wont you take women at their word and accept that what they feel reflects reality  What you consider idealistic  changing norms and realistic  women gaining agency is only your opinion What many communities have made possible is the former and people who have privilege only ever really consider the latter because the latter doesn t require relinquishing some privilege I hope you think about that difference a little bit 
Feminism,1615713047,He said he wasn t asking me Then he proceeded to ask me lol You see question marks in his comment right 
Feminism,1615712628,I clearly directed the question towards feminists  I don t know if you are a man woman or non binary but let me tell you that this post is very much directed to questioning challenging those notions Besides have you critically seen the study How many participants were there Did they take into account social conditioning What were the ages of the women in the study What are the mean response and the standard deviation What are the dependent and independent variables Are there any other studies against this  It is easy to claim studies concluded something But there are many factors that might prove those theses theories wrong Especially when it comes to social psychology and issues like attraction which have significant influence such as social conditioning environment previous experiences etc Many racists want to prove certain races are unattractive by  science  But they are not objective truths Attraction can have many facets Despite never being in a relationship I did like several women who weren t conventionally attractive completely because they were amazing people Similar studies like you said would say that I shouldn t be attracted to them but I was  All I want to say is if you cannot critically think and argue about the claims you are supporting especially in cases of science then begin doing that instead of trolling on the internet You are neither helping anyone or yourself Humans are of huge variety we cannot say this is arbitrary of what attraction  should be 
Feminism,1615712083,I use female avatars all the time and this is the reason I used to give this wasn t ever true but I d say it cause I didn t wanna seem  gay       so it s possible a lot of people give that reason just because they think that s what they re supposed to say 
Feminism,1615712016,Yeah I m obsessed because I m small My insecurity doesn t change what studies say Thanks for the pep talk 
Feminism,1615711933,That s just bullshit Besides based on your history you are a bit too obsessed about this topic to think clearly So I m not even going to argue right now
Feminism,1615711650,That s perfectly fine But there s tons of pubmed studies saying it So I m not just making it up 
Feminism,1615711575,i find it helps if you focus on the actions of the bigot rather than the effect they have on the person they re effecting when you call them out      Like don t defend that specific woman just call out their sexism when it happens I find that usually goes better 
Feminism,1615711527,Wow This comment is not going to stay here for sure   
Feminism,1615711180,I m not a feminist but in the multiple studies on size they do rate the guy as being less masculine

Feminism,1615707132,But fear is a personal thing a lot of the feeling of non safety that I see in women is because of a deep ingrained fear that has been pushed into them by the messaging that they are weak and fragile Men have similar fears but we are taught to accept the risk as a part of living we are taught that we are responsible for any and all things that happen to us Hyperagency I won t speak to the negatives of it they are obvious However there are positives to that approach in life I can and will offer help to someone who needs it Someone who needs it tangibly However I don t belive that we can ever make someone feel truly safe that s for themselves to accept or not While the obvious answer is to find ways to make the world safer realistically the only way to reclaim the night to to change the way we deal with risk not to avoid it but to manage it and to belive that we can And of course to not blame the ones who are not able to  
Feminism,1615706752,People say it because that s what modern feminism is a fascist and power hunger cult just like the nazis were 
Feminism,1615706279,I m sorry if i offended you but can you explain a bit why im objectifying women in this post I don t want to provoke i just want to learn 
Feminism,1615706277,Are you a man If you are you probably have your own lived experiences which you can use to contradict your views I m sure you ve heard some upsetting things from men which you can use in defense of feminism I know that s not a whole solution but it can get you thinking  Good luck  
Feminism,1615706021,Exactly the patriarchy isn t explicitly deciding to oppress individual women while they re walking down the road but that s the effect of indifference It takes actively changing your behavior as a man to help reduce the patriarchy s restriction of women s experiences 
Feminism,1615705231,I think what you ve been doing up until now is right It is important to speak up to bigotry and misogyny when you notice it and I applaud you for doing it The backlash you re experiencing is the same kind feminists get when they refuse to coddle men As patriarchy is a social system there are also women part of enforcing it Hence the negative reactions from women to your actions  It s generally in the interest of patriarchy for men to not step up to bigotry to just let it slide for them to only be interested in protecting a woman in case of sexual desires While contradicting that you will obviously stroke the fur the wrong way for more people than just the one you re calling out on bad behaviour Keep doing what you re doing and know that the comments of   gt   she wont fuck you     She s not your girl  are  natural reactions to that  at least in patriarchy and don t let yourself get dragged down because of these It s the price every activist has to pay Ignore these comments the people saying this aren t as woke
Feminism,1615704544,I m glad you brought this up because it does highlight why this discussion can be so difficult It s so critical to not tear one oppressed group down while trying to prop up another It s further complicated because  Karen has definitely been coopted and used in misogynistic ways but that s not how it started There are a lot of shades of racism blatant racism aversive racism ignorant racism etc and this manifests in a lot of different ways in different situations When Black folx describe a recurring way in which white women can and do abuse their privilege often in ways that play off of their own oppression in the structure of patriarchal white supremacy  see  Central Park Karen as others have mentioned it s important to listen to that Naming things is a powerful way to highlight structural dynamics but of course a single word or name like  Karen is going to be reductive and can easily lose its nuance or unfortunately be coopted In my experience it s So Hard To tell people they re racist and expect them or others to listen Having terms to describe how they are doing that helps I m not sure I support the ongoing use of  Karen given the points you ve made but there s a lot to be learned from its origin There is no real male equivalent for  Karen because in these discussions white man already tells us plenty about a person s privilege And I would point out that in pop culture you  do find references to Steve Chad Dan Kevin etc I do think that the reason they haven t caught on the same way as  Karen is because of misogyny 
Feminism,1615704317,If caring only applies to women  and excludes men does that count as benevolent sexism So it s good and bad at the same time 
Feminism,1615703962,I suggest checking out r StreetEpistemology and try framing your conversations from that standpoint Mutual respect an inquisitive approach to understanding and carefully guiding her through deconstructing her internalized misogyny from a place of how they relate to her core values 
Feminism,1615703546,Hi I ve talked about it on here before but I used to be your friend a few years back  I was a borderline alt righter who was obsessed with anti feminism anti social justice and was a bigot who would join in  raids towards feminist groups What got me to change was people using subtle  disguised feminist leftist  and social justice language and talking points For example if your friend brought up male suicide don t use the word toxic masculinity or any feminist words She will only think you re calling all men toxic and won t listen Instead  Say something like  men are pressured into being a traditional version of men which can cause them to bottle up emotionally and not seek help   She ll probably agree with you if she agree with MRAs If you keep using disguised language and talking points she might change or better yet might even research for herself and change 
Feminism,1615702936,I didn t say he was a typical loser dude I said he LOOKED like a typical loser dude He is fairly successful whether or not I know why I ve only seen him in things where he is mild to moderately overweight and not middle aged but did look like he looked a bit older than he was from bloating But you did seem to miss the issue tv is pairing up merely average looking or worse dudes with super attractive women And not vice versa So considering him to be average looking is just making the point If you refuse to put up average looking women and instead only model attractive ones on tv in movies etc  then the same should be done for men Or just make them all average looking 
Feminism,1615702804,I find the whole idea of being a   white knight kinda dumb like just let people be  kind to each other I don t have a lot of advice but I think being nice is always great
Feminism,1615702615,I totally agree with you Idk Maybe I m just spitballing here Not exactly sure what my original point was anymore  And ty 
Feminism,1615701867,I m fine I m as cool as a cucumber here I m not a feminist but I m the only person who called it out that comments like these are like water to an MRA dying of thirst Sure it s just one person but they had many upvotes before it was But not one single person here spoke up and said  hey that s not really cool 
Feminism,1615701262,How about dropping the tags  anti feminist feminist and take one argument at a time then analyze it and see if the r thorique has flaws and if you agree with it In the end the content should be what matters Men right movement have good points worth investigating on and feminist arguments are valid very often but not always 
Feminism,1615701187,Breasts are a secondary sex characteristic which means they develop differently for males and females  in general and like you said they are often erogenous zones and are sensitive  But just because something is a sex characteristic or an erogenous zone doesn t make it inappropriate or in need of covering Adam s apples and body hair are secondary sex characteristics and most parts of the body are erogenous zones for someone There s no logical reason for why women s breasts need to be covered that isn t related to societal perspectives
Feminism,1615700105,Read literally anything by Andrea Dworkin specifically though  intercourse by her is really good and so is  pornography how men possess women 
Feminism,1615699826,For me the goal is the liberation of women which requires dismantling the patriarchy Equality isn t my goal 
Feminism,1615699800,that seems way too simplistic and seems like a way to dismiss any and all counter arguments men as a group or even as an individual may offer The patriarchy isn t a ku klux klan like group gathering in board rooms rubbing palms together saying   how do we fuck women over today  It s a corporation with sentience but without morality whoes only concern is how to continue to exist in this world How to keep accumulating power As we live in this world both you and I struggle to do the same thing to gain enough influence to get to chose how we live To go from obscurity to fame to go from undesiredable to attractive To be validated as much for who we are as what we do and so we play into it The patriarchy is upheld by both men and women actively and passively and in much the same proportions Maybe check your biasis today 
Feminism,1615699176,It s worth acknowledging that there is a difference between interpersonal and institutional systemic racism While white can experience prejudice on the basis of race they can not be oppressed on the basis of race Whiteness is normative and white people exist in society as the dominant social class meaning there is no institutional prejudice or systems of inequality relating to race that impacts or makes the lives of white people more difficult Reverse racism is generally something you hear in response to white people being asked to examine their privilege or take responsibility for reinforcing social structures rooted in white supremacy Your question is a complex one Racism and homophobia are both oppression that is formed around structures of normativity and ethnocentrism The two manifest in society in different ways and I am not sure it is particularly productive to compare the two 
Feminism,1615698605,Your friend s reason might be better expressed as she does not feel safe topless around men who might give her unwanted attention For what it is worth I breastfeed and when school age children of my friends are around they are curious and want to see my baby drink milk They smile and ask their moms if they were breastfed and it becomes a discussion on mammals 
Feminism,1615698462,It s only considered socially inappropriate because it s considered sexual   The imposition of sexuality onto something nonsexual is a cultural phenomenon And culture can change but not if we don t actively work to change it Since the normalisation of breasts will benefit most women then isn t that something to strive for Just because something is socially unacceptable now doesnt mean it should remain that way forever 
Feminism,1615698144,I do find it ridiculous I just don t see what the fact that a body part is considered  sexual or not has anything to do with whether or not it s considered socially appropriate There s no inherent reason why twerking is sexualized but it is still considered inappropriate Same goes for being topless It just seems like a misguided appeal to authority in the form of biology 
Feminism,1615698042,The status quo or everything as it currently is IS misogynistic in that our institutions are built by men for men  Welcome to r askfeminists 
Feminism,1615697894, gt First no body part is inherently sexual even sexual organs They are sexual in a sexual setting but outside of that they are just another body part This      Also lowkey reminds me of a story about a woman showing her boyfriend how she puts in a tampon And after she inserted it he asked  why didn t you moan  lmao Like just because something involves a part of the reproductive system doesnt mean it will elicit a secual response 
Feminism,1615697448,Because if breasts aren t inherently sexual then why should we have to cover them up Imagine if women decided that men s hands are sexual That they can t be shown in public because that s obscene So men have to buy    gloves to cover them up gloves that are uncomfortable and dig in and leave marks on their skin Male celebrities get harrassed by tabloids and have abuse levvied at them when the gloves accidentily slip and show a bit of hand And then men say  fuck it i don t want to wear gloves anymore Hands aren t even inherently sexual  And women reply  that doesnt matter because  we find them sexual so you have to do what we say and cover up  If you find the above senario ridiculous then you can probably understand why the oversexualisation of breasts is ridiculous 
Feminism,1615697211,Exactly or to be informed that what they re doing is a problem and insist that it isn t 
Feminism,1615697181,Depends I guess I adore shit schlock movies from the   s   s grew up on mst k and they are usually filled with stuff that wouldn t fly today But that s me laughing at the movie rather than along it More contemporary stuff like friends and the rest I just find that extremely unfunny A really good example is everybody loves Raymond and agreed watching a few episodes I was like okay he s a shit husband and now what Are we gonna build on that The funny was nowhere to be found
Feminism,1615696657,OP said breasts are to some degree sexual body parts and I was explaining why I think that s not the case at least outside of patriarchal social norms 
Feminism,1615696472,The word is sexist Why is there a gender specific insult for racism when racism isn t gender specific and women aren t more racist than men Why is there no male equivalent insult  The idea the word is about calling around racism is a pretense in the first place   it s literally just used as a synonym for the word bitch at this point and men on the internet are loving the fuck out of it to use it to harass women in situations that have no relation whatsoever to race If you want to call out a racist just call a racist a racist You don t need to  bring in and weaponize the preexisting cultural attitude of contempt towards women 
Feminism,1615696365,The thick of it is excellent Peter capaldi is great as Malcolm tucker The side characters are pretty fun too
Feminism,1615696146,Not sure what the fact that  breasts are not inherently sexual has anything to do with it though There are a lot of countries where a woman s shoulders are shoulders arms chest legs etc are sexualized and considered inappropriate 
Feminism,1615695733,I dont know I was an activist for years and pulled quite a few women out of the hole but i was also very experienced in debating these talking points by that point For every anti feminist talking about there is at least   probably more excellent counters and since most anti feminist youtubers are terrible people it is usually easy to find proof that they don t know what they are talking about Without knowing her exact positions and reasoning it s hard to tell you what you could say And you should not feel weird telling wrong people they are wrong Like i said i pulled quite a few women out of the anti feminist rabbit hole and from my experience as long as you are not condescending or rude it should be okay You do need to know what you are talking about though and she has to be open to discussing it Her huffing at your evidence is not a good sign though 
Feminism,1615695699,Then he s not believing women about their own experiences and actually going as far as to pathologize it 
Feminism,1615695629,From a feminist perspective everything is misogynistic given enough thought    That would be a fun drinking game game though 
Feminism,1615695617,It s not just polite it s acting in accordance with feminist values to work towards a world where women and men can  feel equally safe 
Feminism,1615695598,i think people should stop  searching for things to be offended by 
Feminism,1615695436,I would tell all the people with opinions on it to write them down like really get into it  pages back and front on their opinion why they think what they do and any far reaches of thought this takes them to I would then instruct these people to fold this information up as small as it will go  so its got nice pointy hard edges and then proceed to place this with all the other worthless shit they produce by inserting it up their asses WHO CARES IF SOME DUDES FINDING GIRLS FUCKING OTHER GIRLS HOT yeah maybe shes a bit of a dick for cheating on him but obviously he could deal with it and still be happy with her so who cares 
Feminism,1615695412,From a feminist perspective indifference is misogynistic Enjoy being part of the norm but it s not feminist 
Feminism,1615695326,No problem And I do appreciate you being considerate and also asking about the specific reasons Most men don t really see what women go through on a daily basis in public so it can be hard to conceptualize  For reference I was first followed by a man when I was   with my aunt He followed us for several blocks and eventually we hid in a cafe to escape him When I worked my first job as a teenager I was cat called between  and   times  no exaggeration on each lunch break when I only walked    blocks I bring male chaperones to bars with me but if the guy I m with goes to the bathroom a man will immediately come to me to hit on me This was compounded with sexual assaults I had experienced  anything physical was from people I knew and I eventually shaved my head and would leave the house only wearing baggy sweats to avoid street harassment My story isn t unique Most women mentally consider their entire night as far as transportation goes before they wear a cute outfit It s a constant thought process for most women So it s really nice when men who don t know you are also considerate on your behalf
Feminism,1615695318,You behave like the world is genderless because you have the freedom to do so Women cannot afford to do so because of all the men who target them for benign women So that s your right know that what you re choosing serves to maintain the status quo where men walk around with more freedom than women 
Feminism,1615694799,Technically sociopathy is not considered an acceptable term in psychology and is strictly a criminal justice criminology  label Traits commonly associated with  sociopathy or  psychopathy can fall into the category of antisocial personality disorder but the terms are considered quite offensive within psychological mental health circles 
Feminism,1615694519, gt It won t convince him because he believes it not his fault women have this fear How incredibly flawed is this logic by the way  I m not responsible for             happening so I m just not going to give a shit about it and potentially harm people with my ignorance and behavior with no remorse    amp  x   B I haven t heard a single good argument to support his side of this at all 
Feminism,1615694472,And thus instead of asking ourselves  why  we ask  why not   In the words of the great William and Theodore  Be excellent to each other 
Feminism,1615694372,Thank you for helping me see it in a different light 
Feminism,1615694324,Your friend sounds   lovely  I m lying  He sounds like a jerk 
Feminism,1615694279,The issue is we still  feel like we re being followed Most women have trauma of a sexually violent or harassment nature Many women have been followed or harassed by strangers I don t know many women who have never been cat called or followed by a stranger Many women have PTSD  being a woman is actually listed in the DSM as a risk factor for PTSD  You wouldnt walk through a room full of veterans banging pots and pans because you might trigger a trauma response from someone Being conscious of making women feel safe is similar You don t know if the woman you re trailing has PTSD from being stalked by a stranger or some other trauma that makes her hypervigilent of men
Feminism,1615694185,This is a great point I agree that white women who use their privilege as a weapon should be called out for it I remember the story of the woman who was in the park and she called the police on a black man who was bird watching At the time  Karen seemed to refer to that kind of racist behavior specifically from white women Now it s a term that seems to have misogynistic undertones that are hard for me to explain but I know it when you see it 
Feminism,1615694141,I think it s awesome of you to take the time to explain him btw As you said he doesn t care because he doesn t feel the issue has anything to do with him So bring back the point of view on someone he technically should be more concerned about like his girlfriend sister mom 
Feminism,1615693957,Seriously And the edits about his friend s girlfriend Cringe  Oh poor me I can t decide who I agree with  
Feminism,1615693824,You are incredibly biased Your friend is sexist and lacks empathy and you stand by him in that and even question if you are not convinced by his views yourself   You even have your own sexist biases to contend with judging on the things you ve said here It s more than talking about politeness when you looking at his comment about men experiencing more violence to divert from the fact that women overwhelmingly experience more sexual violence Let alone the fact that it s men that primarily perpetuate all forms of violence It s like that one liner  Men are afraid that women will laugh at them Women are afraid that men will kill them  If you can t recognize the difference in experiences between men and women and at least have some modicum of empathy about it you re dealing with misogyny then 
Feminism,1615693802,This stuck out to me too It s one thing to not go out of your way to do it It s another to try to convince your guy friends that they shouldn t
Feminism,1615693748,Dude someone who says things like your friend is not a cool guy Maybe to YOU but his attitude towards others puts him in huge a    hole territory    I m so glad my partner and his mates are the types to stand up against the discrimination and oppression of others they treat women LGBTQ and POC s with common decency Restores my faith in humanity that decent men do exist 
Feminism,1615693540, gt I think this is an interesting case If we stop telling women to fear men in order to be safe would the fear go away No because all women know a woman if not many women who has  have been raped You asked somewhere else if men had power to change this dynamic Yeah if they stopped assaulting women Men are the primary perpetrators of violence against all genders Ya ll have the power to stop that by not committing crimes Until that happens   until a girl is born into a world where she doesn t hear about her relatives or friends getting assaulted or isn t assaulted and harassed herself women won t stop fearing men 
Feminism,1615693477,I mean that s a whole other thing Racism and sexism unfortunately do coexist Till and the victims of the tulsa race massacre were victims of racism justified by white men through sexism You say it as if it was the white women doing the lynching when it was due to white men being mad at black men  in tills case Bryant s husband in the massacre hundreds of white men for not knowing their place and infringing on their property 
Feminism,1615693348,This is so true I was thinking this but I couldn t put it to words 
Feminism,1615356852,I think that s more due to social conditioning that anything biological TBH 
Feminism,1615356536,The category of  tomboy shouldn t exist We need to accept a final biological truth about human beings   The distribution of human traits are not isolated along neatly gendered boxes  Some women are more aggressive than most men Some men are more nurturing than most women Some women enjoy going hunting Many  modern men  especially now would probably hate going hunting  Some women are very  physical in their approach to live Whilst many men are  emotional in their approach to life Humans do not neatly fit into gendered boxes we never really have It is culture and society that attempted to push people into the gendered boxes Biology is never  neat in that way   
Feminism,1615354953,If you would be able to   hopefully if necessary wanted you can find a doctor willing to do that 
Feminism,1615354824,Living in a country that is not US this worries me Legislative actions in the US have ripples all around the world and it scares me that this move might be accepted or even welcomed where I live  It s very scary the times we are about to see If women do not unite to vote such men out of public offices this will not be the last of it They will slowly take away everything that makes our autonomy 
Feminism,1615354711,I agree about Marshall and Lily and I really like their split at the end of the first season It was very realistic And I think Marshall was the best character on the show Just wanna add that NPH was still in the closet during the first season or at least part of it And I don t have much issue with Friends in this respect because Joey wasn t lying to the people he slept with 
Feminism,1615354230,Oh yeah well I think it was  Friends that really cemented the gosh it s funny how this guy sleeps with everyone character They pushed the envelope with Barney though because it was well known that NPH was gay so anything Barney did was seen through that lens   it s not real  the real NPH is gay    I think what ultimately made that show nice was having Lily and Marshall It was the type of relationship you never see on TV he was not a man child and she was not an emotional roller coaster They were just two people who loved each other and their relationship tensions weren t a big part of either the drama or the comedy of the show  There were some whole seasons that were just awful though 
Feminism,1615352926,I worry about it being overturned but politically I think republicans would be apprehensive since the loss of it as a talking point would probably turn a lot of them away from the party or at least lessen their resolve
Feminism,1615352330,I agree about the transphobia Just want to add that on top of that Barney lies to hundreds of women in order to sleep with them He comes up with fake names and fake jobs and backstories He takes on fake identities in order to trick women into sex which in my opinion means they never consented to sleeping with Barney they only consented to sleeping with whatever persona he was using He s a serial rapist and he s proud of it And then at the end of the show he becomes slut shamey which the show treats as character growth all because he had a daughter Fuck that I love some of the character moments and I think it uses really clever framing devices in every episode and I love the nonlinear intertwined storytelling but I hate basically all of the subtext of the show 
Feminism,1615351995,I couldn t enjoy the movie Vertigo because of the tacit sexism throughout the second half even though many people I respect call it one of the best movies ever made Same thing with Some Like It Hot but with that one it s only the last minute of the movie that ruins it for me 
Feminism,1615351102,Anna Bey who runs the School of Affluence designed to help women groom themselves to attract rich men is not a feminist With regard to the specific comments   I don t spend time with men who mistreat me   people can be materialistic if they want they don t need a reason   men and women are different and we all deserve equality socially economically politically   how people do their economics within their relationship is private business and neither here nor there with regard to being a feminist If you re interesting in feminism read feminist authors 
Feminism,1615351090,Hey where did you get these I d love a source 
Feminism,1615350993, I don t think a true feminist will agree to those statements These are more like coming from her own  whoever is Anna Bey licenciousness 
Feminism,1615350614,those statements are not feminist Anna Bey can say whatever she wants it doesn t make her a feminist also asking us to answer for some random woman who said she was a feminist sucks
Feminism,1615350422,Do we really have to have a conversation about how the feminists of of    s era are not the same as the feminists today Do we Egalitarianism is fairly new feminism is old no duh it accomplished stuff but they didn t do it in a day It took time expecting a different movement of otherwise is a little absurd Egalitarianism is a starting movement it is growing and Egalitarianism is a more gender neutral term  femin ism  egalatarian ism  or  human ism whichever you prefer And feminism has warn out its accomplishments in the sense it achieved what it wanted hell in     google did a bit kf digging and found they underpayed men Feminism has put more women in leadership than ever before plenty of female leaders around the world  Germany Croatia etc  the wage gap no longer exists and has been debunked domestic violence is getting ever closer to      with the two genders  I m not saying it is good but hey men aren t doing it all right  mothers are the primary parent selected in court settlements females make up    of the workforce now  yet only   of the workplace deaths women even make up    of the population officially making men the minority  that last one is a little dumb I know Give Egalitarianism time just like older generations did with Feminism  Also everything I say is US based statistics 
Feminism,1615349416,I feel like I was either one depending on the day Some days I loved to dress in my most boyish clothes and feel tough or masculine Other days I loved putting on a princess costume or long skirts and pretending to be a princess Nowadays I much prefer pants and men s shoes but I like womens tops with flowery patterns and pretty sleeves  colors and I wear jewelry I know for a fact that when I was pretty young I wanted to be a boy  like to the point that I tried to convince my mom I was a boy I literally remember asking her things like  but how do you KNOW I m not a boy    And  are you SURE  A part of me legitimately wanted to be a boy probably all the way until middle school I actually felt a fair amount of shame in the fact that I was a girl Not sure why  my parents always wanted girls so there was no pressure on that end But I wanted boy friends I liked doing  boyish stuff like sports and getting dirty and I would much rather have hung out with a group of boys and felt like one of them than had female friends I still liked playing  girly games though and I played dressup and with dolls and all that too It really just depended on the moment and the day Tbh it still does a little depend on the day whether I wish I could dress act more feminine or masculine I actually might have some body dysphoria Like there are days my boobs feel wrong and I wish they would go away and I wish I had a flat chest and I ve even like put a dildo in my pants to see what it would be like to have a penis And it came with a sense of like relief So I might not be a great case because even though I am     sure I m a cisgender woman and have no desire to do a sex change or anything I still might have a little gender something going on Idk This rambled a bit but if anyone can relate I d love to hear it 
Feminism,1615349310,I don t know the details but the last time this happened I was really scared And I am really scared now For myself and women in Arkansas It s frustrating and enraging to think that a complete stranger I ve never met can tell me what I can and can t do with my body My life would be a lot more stressful Full disclosure I don t take birth control or want an IUD because the side effects give me massive anxiety So if Roe were overturned and I needed to get an abortion  because I know for sure I don t want kids  I d have to resort to underground abortions or keep the child Either decision would certainly destroy my mental health I can predict the constant panic attacks The effects of these decisions that these people make have massive repercussions But I swear all they care about is control The whole idea that we re letting    or so old men and women who are strangers tell us what we can do is mind boggling Some laws should not be laws because they re rights we re all born with What the fucking fuckkkkk Sorry I m just really angry Anyway yeah 
Feminism,1615349263,This is is a step back FOR ALL WOMEN This is NOT OK 
Feminism,1615348916,My masculinity was that of convenience and comfort I didn t enjoy being labeled as anything but I did want to keep playing with my friends and didn t like being treated different for just being a girl It did definitely become a protective identity for a good portion of my life 
Feminism,1615348692,Haw haw their subreddit got banned after not even a week 
Feminism,1615348576,If you come to terms with the fact that you can t hold people from the past to modern standards and expect them to be modern saints you ll be disappointed Lincoln believed that black people were inferior So did everyone else even some black people who were bullied into believing that What is considered racist now may not have been considered racist then Just like some things we do now will be considered savage in    years 
Feminism,1615348304,Still assumptions that men would have sex just with any women just to have sex is an untrue stereotype No men checks up all the women all the time nor do the rest Its just variation on already toxic  men always are horny and ready for sex  
Feminism,1615348099,Yes they will probably know that The supreme court justices aren t perfect but they are very educated and just hearing a case means they have to get up to date on both sides of the argument 
Feminism,1615347869,      I know that you know that But will Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh understand that let alone enough to care 
Feminism,1615347643,That would be a hard sell considering many people don t even know they re pregnant by then Something is pretty restrictive if you can t get it at all 
Feminism,1615347177,Legal experts seem to be of the opinion that there s a very decent chance they overrule it in the future but much more likely is that the Supreme Court will simply chip and chip away at it over the next few years to the point where it ll all but be gone and people will have hardly noticed without there being a grand public  overturning   Instead the plan appears to be to simply abuse the  without excessive restriction part of Roe whereby they re interpret it to side with a bunch of GOP measures like limiting it to    weeks or  till the first sign of a heartbeat which they ll now say is justifiable and  not restrictive  
Feminism,1615346696,Your last sentence kind of put me off  shes fifty now   Doesn t excuse woody Allen s behavior Plus it seemed she was groomed They say their relationship started when she was    I doubt that And aside from that  in regards to Dylan  why would a child make something like this up 
Feminism,1615346460,Yes please do I d love to see this And people who have been abused have it a lot worse Seriously Comparing those abused vs those accused and how their lives were destroyed Get out of here 
Feminism,1615346438,You re seriously excusing woody Allen s behavior Did you see Dylan speaking about the abuse God help you
Feminism,1615346438,Your question seems to be based on a socialist doctrines that I ultimately don t share In particular liberals don t assume we have to elect angels just people if they self corrupt we remove them through elections The problem then is that many of our elections aren t competitive enough and don t remove the self corrupted So strong electoral reform is the first step 
Feminism,1615346263,It s interesting how things change As a teenager in the   s I thought The Mary Tyler Moore show was great It showed an independent woman living alone with a career  It was inspiring Keep in mind reruns of the Honeymooners was still on and the Flintstones  was a popular kid s show So Mary Tyler Moore  showed another life entirely  Now I m just as fussy as hell about what I watch

Feminism,1615345787, gt I don t think there s any hard evidence that men handle pain any worse than women I ve seen studies that say both that men have a higher pain tolerance than women and vice versa  it s definitely been measured but I don t really think there s any definitive results 
Feminism,1615345469,While The Boys isn t perfect I don t think that it tries to trivialize rape either The whole point of the show is that these superheroes are deeply abusing their power over others The Deep Popclaw Homelander more  The point of the show  among others is the frustration that you should feel at being powerless to stop this kind of gross abuse That these people are literal rapists murderers and nazis and there is nothing you can do about it That includes rape And the show doesn t call it anything else Do they go too far with it sometimes I think so The scene where The Deep gets raped is very graphic Is it gratuitous I don t think so I think that it is an important part of the story one that should make you feel uncomfortable I agree that some trigger warnings would be nice but I disagree that this is just gratuitous 
Feminism,1615344370,The theoretical system of choice seems irrelevant to me my question is how would you get rid of an elite and the accumulation and concentration of illicit capital as a consequence you would have to ensure you elect angels and hope they don t self corrupt history doesn t give much hope there 
Feminism,1615344104,Catholic grade school and high school in a winter climate stopped me from wearing skirts for decades I have scars on my knees from slipping on ice and not having anything to protect my knees 
Feminism,1615343460,The patriarchy benefits only the dominant males as it is a dominance hierarchy system after all so most men don t particularly like it they uphold it because they tend to think the replacement will be worse than what currently is another dominance hierarchy ruled by a minority of women and not a minority of men patriarchy  Most of us rarely have the luxury of deciding what we really believe or want as we are reacting to circumstances imposed on us by the powers that be Most men don t like the fact that they have to chase women and have the burden of proving their sexual attractiveness to both men and women  patriarchy  they also don t like having the burden to be tough or whatever but at the same time they don t see the possibility of a system where dominance isn t a crucial part Simply because humans aren t equal in any sphere and differences lead to evaluations and evaluations lead to judgements Those with favourable valuations will automatically have the favour and trust of others which they can then manipulate and get away with

Feminism,1615340614, gt If I don t fit into what society deems a male to be do I really get those same privileges To a degree Male privilege isn t only about getting stuff though it s about what you don t have to deal with based on your status as a man and those things usually come at the expense of women You don t have to deal with medical providers disbelieving you when your sick because you re a man and men are over emotional and have a reputation to exaggerate You live in a world where medicines are created and tested and judged for efficacy for a body like yours Your status as a man has never at any point in history been a hindrance to being employed owning purchasing land or having control over money You live in a world where laws first and foremost had people like you in mind with class race sexuality ect as  modifiers   To add benevolent sexism doesn t empower women It s based on the idea that women are inherently inferior and need to be helped and handled gently It s based in the idea that women are basically like children that need to be protected and humored buy not necessarily taken seriously It s based in the idea that women aren t capable of taking care of themselves because they re women Sexism is a shit sandwich on sandwich bread and benevolent sexism is a shit sandwich on an artisan bun It kiiiiind of looks better but it s still just a shit sandwich 
Feminism,1615340304,Same thing as stay at home moms  I have pragmatic concerns like what if the working person gets injured or sick and is not able to work  is the family able to sustain its lifestyle on disability payments and savings  If not always good for the stay at home spouse to have some marketable skill they keep fairly current with  But I don t have any issue with people who find more fulfillment in familial and domestic labor than any other kind of labor or if it makes more sense for a man to stay home with the kids if one adult has to  In the case of a gay male couple adopting kids and if one stays home it will by definition be a man so I don t see what the scandal would be  Men can take care of children and keep a house perfectly well 
Feminism,1615339774,This is the best answer in my opinion and the first thing that popped up in my head as soon as I read the question 
Feminism,1615339122,You might find the SEP articles on  Feminist Philosophy   and  Feminist Political Philosophy   to be of interest 
Feminism,1615338739,I felt precisely the same way about TBBT and left if after a while PopCulture Detective has a good video on some of the tropes that appear on the show if you haven t seen it 
Feminism,1615338100,I find myself to be forgiving the farther back it goes but it depends Like for example I Love Lucy Several stereotypes there but the thing with the show is it is female led She s a comedic genius who created this sort of empire Even if her show is about a kooky housewife the point is to see just how hilarious she could be The show wasn t preaching about how to be a housewife but proving that a woman could stand her own in a room full of male comedians She was ground breaking with the work she did to prove women could even if some things about the show are still a little traditional There s a bit of first wave feminism about it Even the Dick Van Dyke Show with Mary Tyler Moore But shows like M  A  S  H I wouldn t forgive because they re too obviously misogynistic like Caddyshack If the show is   s or   s especially   s I just cannot watch Because there is no excuse It s one thing to live during a time when certain ideas about gender weren t floating around or there was hardly any representation of independent women It s another thing to live during a time when women are owning businesses and have roles in government and you re still propagating misogynistic ideas But if you re in the   s like Friends and you re still producing sexist work that just means they don t care enough or know they ll get a pass It seems ridiculous to say oh it s a product of its time But some things really are if that makes sense I mean I think it can be obvious with some shows But yeah the closer they are to now and the context of the awareness at the time about women s experience the less I ll be comfortable watching 
Feminism,1615337686,thank you for your input you helped me understand it better
Feminism,1615337492,I want everyone to have equal opportunity regardless of gender race sexual orientation etc I want to prevent harassment and assault against women that is currently accepted or ignored instead of being stopped Perhaps more specific to where I work when someone walks into this office I want them to not assume that the only woman in the room must be the secretary And as long as certain political parties keep attacking certain rights just to continue having a wedge issue I want to ensure that abortion is legal and accessible Our list of priorities might differ a bit depending on each of our own interests and experiences but I consider myself a feminist because feminism is a movement that is working on the issues that I care about issues I knew about before knowing what a  feminist was The label isn t the point it s not important to me that everyone knows that I consider myself a feminist I just care about how we re helping people and making society better I don t know if there is an egalitarian movement working on any of this If there is I d be happy to join them I didn t see that on reddit though Just some subreddit for not feminists to complain about feminists for not making everything about men even though there were already several subreddits for that I m not interested in joining something regressive and useless like that I want to help people Feminists do that so I want to be a feminist

Feminism,1615335863,As a transgender woman I m still irked by things that were pretty mainstream in the     s Like on  How I Met Your Mother  where Ted was looking for what was wrong with the woman he was dating and one hypothetical was that she used to have a penis And the thing is probably most of the people who worked on those shows would say they regret that they did that But what I don t get is why you don t think about it first I mean sure it was socially acceptable at the time to take a shot at trans women  still is actually  but there s a pretty clear way to know if it might be seen differently in the future ask yourself  is it mean  If there were a person from the group that I m taking down on the set right now would I still be comfortable making that joke If someone I loved were in that group would I still be comfortable making that joke  And you know it s hard because I actually really liked that show  Friends was another show that was openly and relentlessly transphobic but I really liked it too There were some transphobic jokes on  Scrubs  All shows I watched from cover to cover People forget that we trans folks are just like you  we watch TV go to the movies consume entertainment We hear what people say about us when they aren t aware that we re watching 
Feminism,1615335857,I wanted to scratch my eyes out at the sexist horror show called the The Queen s Gambit and everyone thought that was the bees knees Wasn t surprised to find that it was made by a bunch of old white guys   even the author  I find the stereotypes more insidious and disturbing in contemporary film television I expect it in shows made decades ago and it s pretty easy to point out and dialogue about it

Feminism,1615335000,The bigger question is  why do we call them tomboys   Girls don t innately call themselves tomboys but adults signify them as different or not normal In my opinion some girls just like to play in mud or play sports or go camping or whatever Them being called tomboys enforces gender normativity even as a child effectively saying  You re not really acting lady like   Some girls embrace this while others balk but they can t identify as a tomboy unless someone calls them that

Feminism,1615333263,the sexist ideas that underly benevolent sexism do more harm to women than good Sure getting free food is cool but not at the expense of being expected to be submissive to the man 
Feminism,1615333135,Yeah someone recommended me a book earlier My classes have taught me some of the pillars with feminism being what you said it is however social media has added what I mentioned earlier to my understanding of it so I got a bit misguided And yeah I noticed that I could ve phrased what I was asking differently after the pushback I assumed people would know I meant it in a way for working towards equality for all and reducing sexism 
Feminism,1615332831,I agree  that show was thought provoking emotional and darn funny

Feminism,1615331040, gt I m curious what you mean by  unreasonable sacrifices  I mean a sacrifice something large for minimal benefit something that would alter the course of one s life for little benefit he might not even see in his own lifetime Having said that there are some things men could sacrifice for that are just as important to a man s life as a lot the things that women sacrifice for instance being forced to sign up for the draft police brutality being able to look after one s children But for most men risk reward would be too great for to be expected to to try and randomly do a lot of things forbidden by society to just defeat patriarchal gender roles  I don t think anyone should be expected to put themselves at risk or sacrifice their dreams for something they  personally don t feel that strongly about or don t benefit at all from

Feminism,1615398700,The last time the supreme court was expanded was       Several states and significantly more people have joined the union since then While FDRs plan to expand the court was shot down that does not mean it s impossible to do it now We just need legislators with some backbone you challenge the status quo regarding the court 
Feminism,1615398695,I never realized that before thank you a lot it s really opened my eyes a lot more Of all the major social media platforms I see most conversations happening on twitter so I thought it was mainly there Like for instance I ve talked a lot about ADHD  cause I have it and when I finally saw it trending a few weeks ago it felt like it was finally being talked about It also took me a long time to finally find a pocket online where ADHD was actually being talked about too  I ll take your advice because I ve spent the past few days away from twitter and I ve felt a lot happier and now I m more inclined to find the conversations I m looking for somewhere else Like just looking through one of the subreddits recommended to me on this thread I noticed a huge difference in the language being used

Feminism,1615397763,So I m telling you what I am because I know SM uses that format  it s a problematic and ineffective format but you re using it precisely because that s what other people do You think that s how a conversation about an important issue  supposed to go To put it gently twitter is a great platform for short punchy communication It s meant to be a little abrasive abrupt  that s the nature of the platform But as fun as it is twitter is not where  everything happens and it s not true that just because something isn t a trending hashtag it isn t important and no one cares about it My best advice to you would be to spend less time online so you can recalibrate your conversational style and capacity I know for me that the communication  styles associated with many SM platforms have resulted in me not even using twitter and curtailing my participation on other platforms  because I don t think they promote effective or meaningful conversation 
Feminism,1615396630,I didn t notice that I use a lot of language like that it s what I ve picked up from social media I ve never realized it wasn t okay I ve seen a lot of conversations brought up using that kind of language I was just trying to find where the conversation I m looking for my intention wasn t to shame anyone I ve tried a couple times on social media to talk about it but I ve never found any engagement for it so I honestly just didn t know where to look for it Tbh now everything I ve learned from people s responses to this thread has made me realize how bad social media is  or at least twitter with looking for the conversation I m looking for I also know I m horrible at communicating what I m trying to say so sorry for that

Feminism,1615396326, gt There s a particular book I have in mind Then it sounds to me like you already know what to read Workhouses or poorhouses existed for both men and women and they weren t necessarily  for battered or  fallen people  though certainly some institutions did exist with the explicit purpose of putting poor widows and otherwise  fallen women to work  I think you have to keep in mind that spousal abuse in the US and many other countries was perfectly legal It wouldn t be seen as a  valid reason to leave a marriage and women who did so prior to it becoming recognized as legally valid would be considered social outcasts aka  fallen women 
Feminism,1615396280,Please use the search bar side bar wiki for this frequently asked question 
Feminism,1615396054,Tbh I m more worried that OPs is asking about their own conduct in a roundabout way
Feminism,1615395035,Yeah I think patriarchy runs so deep and is so entrenched in everything that we really do need to dismantle and rebuild from the ground up  every norm and assumption our current society is built upon tends to be at least somewhat tainted by patriarchy Doesn t seem reforms operating within the current societal system can cut it 
Feminism,1615394981,I personally find this kind of absolutism very frustrating You make these general statements like  No one is talking about this  the conversations are  never present  but at the same time admit you haven t been active in trying to find spaces or people where these things are discussed online I think it s way less productive to try to shame people into talking about an issue you want to talk about by accusing them of not caring or purposefully ignoring something  and yes though it may not be your intention  this kind of  no one language is absolutely antagonistic and shaming than it is to be pro active about something you care about If  not enough people on social media are engaged in this topic and you really care about it  then you need to signal boost those topics and show some leadership for increasing the visibility of the things you care about in a way you think is appropriate sitting around waiting for someone else to do it for you is truly baffling to me 
Feminism,1615394624,Thanks You know it s hard to imagine a time when this won t be an issue So long as men are in power This government system was not designed for women or people of color We need to just dismantle the whole thing and start over If only we could

Feminism,1615394446,I struggled a lot with internalized misogyny I also lived on fantasy and adventure books and I think those played a role in how I wanted to present myself to the world I was also bullied quite a bit so I think I started trying to find an identity in  not fitting in  because the more I tried to  fit in the worse it got for me because I was very very bad at understanding and reacting to social cues That combined with the internalized misogyny translated into  I have to act like the boy characters in the books I read for me for a good part of my childhood Oh also I m gay So there s that lol I have some gender stuff I ve   barely  scratched the surface of too though it s all so hard to untangle  I ve only just come to terms with being a lesbian in the last few years I grew up in a religious family and kid me being gay would have been wholly unacceptable even if I hadn t been ostracized at school I think I can understand what you re saying about the romantic narrative between girls and boys I really really didn t want to kiss or marry a boy  though at the time I thought I was making that feeling up and would eventually want that and being a tomboy might have been another act of rejection for me 
Feminism,1615394380,I keep thinking we re getting lead up to  feminist icon Lena Dunham or something 
Feminism,1615394257,I ll seek out those platforms more then I didn t know where to start honestly but I have a better idea now And yeah I recognize that with social media A lot of what I ve learned about feminism in my classes never seemed to be present in the conversations I see on social media 
Feminism,1615394084,  Do you understand what cancelling means Or are you just mad about it because you feel it s  unfair or  goes too far    If his sister has unresolved feelings about what happened or never knew it happened and found out as an adult  then regardless of when the incident occurred or why he is definitely accountable to apologizing to  her  at the very least He did a wrong he should seek to correct that wrong if he is able This can look a variety of ways and may or may not be a  public event   If someone apologizes to one person they behaved inappropriately towards but then continues to behave that way in future interactions  that suggests that they weren t accountable for the behaviour The work they did towards remediating the harm they caused wasn t genuine  they apologized as a means to escape accountability They are still liable therefore for the harm that they caused A trend like this might be called a  pattern of behaviour and suggests that a private or public confrontation regarding the offender is not adequate to correct or deter the person from continuing to harm others  a more serious consequence or intervention may be required 
Feminism,1615393674,I think that s a matter of curation on your part  you see more of what you seek out  If you aren t seeking out people and organizations that give platforms to these ideas  that s not necessarily the  fault of the people and orgs etc you are seeking out to follow It doesn t mean the issue isn t considered important or relevant For all the talk of algorithmic alignment and echo chambers  social media will not actually present on a platter the information you desire It s an active relationship 
Feminism,1615393003,What do you mean when you say  cancelled  what comes under that heading for you

Feminism,1615392090,Cancelling someone in this manner is holding them accountable for their actions There are consequences for what people do Even now if it is just coming to fruition 
Feminism,1615392076,Only one way to mitigate it  I use that word because my pessimistic ass genuinely thinks we can t avoid it is to Vote Those Bastards Out  If you re a woman vote And vote against the right wing 
Feminism,1615391953,I feel like you already posted this question a month or so ago 
Feminism,1615391396,Can we please stop using  cancelled when we mean  held accountable for their actions  These are ridiculous situations How was a    year old person  accidentally sexually assaulting someone Furthermore are you suggesting that we should  cancel somebody for a mistake they made when they were a child Children need education and potentially counseling not  cancelling  If someone is aware that the thing they are doing is wrong and continues to do it they should face the necessary consequences for those actions

Feminism,1615388910, gt This is already the law in the US it is not in France and Germany unfortunately  
Feminism,1615388703,I think that for anyone of any gender leaving a career to raise a family is a hugely dangerous career move that can leave you trapped in a marriage where your partner has all the power and literally no one should do it without a very clear and frank discussion of  what would happen if the working partner was no longer living or able to work or we got a divorce  that results in the homemaking partner feeling that they d be adequately safe and independent in the case of the worst happening But that being said I think stay at home dads are equally awesome brave people as stay at home moms 
Feminism,1615388462,I dunno why do some girls like Barbies Kids like different stuff  I feel like I ve always liked the stuff that I like and people came up with names for what that made me The thing that I don t get is what the arbitrary cutoff line is for who is a tomboy  All the girls in my neighborhood climbed trees and rode bikes and played sports  Some of them also played with dolls  Some of them also played with dinosaurs  Some wore pants and some wore dresses  There s some magical line where you like enough girl stuff that you re  normal and too little and you re a  tomboy and it really just feels like arbitrary boxes trying to divide up and pathologize a normal variation in human interests 
Feminism,1615387953,Yes but that is an exception as you mentioned so it is better to go with the general rule 
Feminism,1615387852, gt Further a mother should not be able to unilaterally add a father to the birth certificate In most places it is not the case that someone can just randomly pick anyone to put on the birth certificate  the father has to have been present and usually also sign the certificate themselves This was also already discussed elsewhere in the context of this thread  which again I m presuming you did not actually read The problem with this whole thread trajectory is that you are outraged at me about something that largely doesn t happen the way that you ve decided it has I find it very depressing how often I have to tell people that if an issue is of such significance to them  it behooves them to have a more complete understanding of the nuances and specifics of the subject 
Feminism,1615387665,one of those FDS tinged  I m a  real feminist because I take advantage of men things it seems
Feminism,1615387446,Other commenters had good points but I d also like to add that standards for women are stricter Like those benefits aren t just contingent on being a  feminine woman but also a young and attractive one Also the role we have to perform in order to reap any  benefit is a subservient one where men are expected to perform the role of a superior Being constrained into  any role is harmful sure and that s why conversations are held about toxic masculinity etc But it s so different to be constrained into the role of superior vs inferior leader vs follower paid labor for the family vs unpaid labor for the family 
Feminism,1615387069,This Anna Bey person seems to be some sort of lifestyle influencer on social media I don t think she has anything to do with feminism 
Feminism,1615387064,This is probably one of those threads where OP drops some inflammatory shit and then never comes back 
Feminism,1615387039,Some people really want to get fucking murdered We re not about to make murder socially acceptable regardless and any person who wanted to get murdered going around defending murderers like  well some people like ME  like getting murdered would rightfully be punched in the fucking face Like how would the catcaller know that the woman they re calling is into it or not Any person advocating for predatory behavior because they re personally into it is disgusting and selfish I m into being slapped but I don t go around like  well some women  enjoy it when people are talking about dv like are you fucking kidding me

Feminism,1615382679,Yes I was thinking this I do know people that have met in such contexts but it s always been triggered by some of factor for a example I know a very eccentric couple that met in a local  shop after stopping to comment on each other s outfits They hit it off immediately so the proposal to go for a drink wasn t unexpected I think a lot of people struggle with context and reading situations
Feminism,1615382168,We should question everything that s how I learn at least So I m still trying to understand the objectivity in what you re saying Your justification seems to be that number of options in one s life is the qualifier for goodness in one s life that having more options is inherently better than having less From my point of view that still seems like a  subjective opinion 
Feminism,1615382098,I m looking at DC and wondering why the fuck we have to keep playing this game Forget Roe v Wade  stop relying on a fickle judgement that can be obsoleted in one stroke of a pen if  people share the same opinion For Christ s sakes it s been almost   years   Congress needs to codify abortion rights in law 
Feminism,1615381057,I never said that all men would have sex with all women I am simply giving examples where I have heard men express sexual desire for what they claim are unattractive or average women to illustrate the difference that I believe the previous commenter was referring to The jogger situation is from personal observation I have been shocked to see literally every car driven by a male slowing down and or the driver looking out their side and rear mirror Every single one I have been the jogger and a person walking behind the driver I have had men admit to me that feel compelled to look at female joggers My point is I have never seen women do this but it is apparently quite a common behavior from men 
Feminism,1615379272,yeah I assume the argument would be that if you don t want to have any babies you shouldn t be having sex Despite the fact that that s never ever worked in the history of ever 
Feminism,1615378168, gt That would be a hard sell considering many people don t even know they re pregnant by then The argument will be that women should just be  more responsible and take the initiative to check their pregnancy status consistently and rigorously To a man or an older conservative woman who has lost sympathy for those with unwanted pregnancies or just someone who s generally out of touch that argument will likely make total sense 
Feminism,1615377976,You are not entitled to free speech on Reddit my dude Also  r feminism is very clear about the fact that they are a space for feminists to talk about feminism not for people to come and antagonize and ask questions that are critical That s the point And that s fine because sometimes you just want to talk about your thing without people bugging you about it 
Feminism,1615377686,Ah so now all of a sudden you don t want to carry a critical conversation just because it s inconvenient I thought we were supposed to be up to talking about things from both sides to understand one another 
Feminism,1615377436,I think you misunderstood what I said Being a man gives you a bonus over being a woman  at least in most societies  this applies to all of them But then there are many other parameters and  bonuses like being white being rich being intelligent etc Each human being starts with  bonuses and  maluses  I don t know how to express this differently  And because all humans are made of many different qualities and characteristics it does happen than men will be less privileged than some women But the fact is that in our societies we put values and hierarchies between the differences between humans and in that sense being a man is considered more valued it gives you an advantage and this applies to anyone being in that category But of course you re not only  a man  you are many other things that will influence your place in society And yes there are advantages a black man has over a woman You could become president of the USA for example Or in some countries you d have much more rights than women Or you have less chances to be sexually assaulted etc This of course doesn t mean all black men have it better than all white women It s like saying men are generally taller than women It doesn t mean ALL men are taller than ALL women it doesn t mean that you cannot find MANY women who are taller than MANY men etc   but the general statement still is true men are generally taller than women 
Feminism,1615376807,I already had a consultation for it a few years ago so I m on the books fortunately 
Feminism,1615376711, gt Do we really have to have a conversation about how the feminists of of    s era are not the same as the feminists today Do we Apparently we do I didn t even read the rest because this is ridiculous 
Feminism,1615375294,lol demmian is a MALE who thinks his phil   class lets him talk down to women 
Feminism,1615375054,I agree with you as well I wanna ask you something though do you use TikTok Because that platform is one of if not the most toxic social media right now The petty gender war between men and women is ridiculous and it s so sad to see so many  feminists saying all men are rapists and whenever someone tries to say otherwise they respond with  it s a large enough portion of men to classify as all of them even though it s like       And it s also sad to see the men on TikTok shutting down actual feminists just because they re women 
Feminism,1615374638,Please don t be sorry You are so on point about everything 
Feminism,1615373104,My role of thumb is if they can t physically remove themselves from the conversation don t hit on them So ie people in line barista s and service employees etc 
Feminism,1615372948,I think it s simply misogyny to call girls who like  boyish things a  tomboy  Everyone is perfectly allowed to like whatever they find interesting We should stop gendering activities and hobbies for good Climbing trees and liking cars doesn t make you less of a girl than liking dolls and pink skirts 
Feminism,1615372885, If that s what they want to do that s cool Men embracing their nurturing side is a good thing for society  They  and their working partner is she is female face a lot of sexist backlash in society  Being completely financially dependent on another person is putting yourself in a power dynamic that can be abused  that goes for stay at home men or women
Feminism,1615372655,Not only that but following feminist on instagram made me realise my internalised misogyny even though I called myself a feminist It is shocking how many of the things we believe are normal are rooted in patriarchy So in that sense we improve ourselves our mindset Following feminists that recommended important books say things I have never thiught about before and would have never fought for if I didn t know  But it is alw ys funnt to me when someone especially a male tries to show we are not feminists enough
Feminism,1615370563,Since my country finally made abortion legal in     it s so sad to see the US go backwards at this stage It s like one step forward two steps back for women

Feminism,1615363874,I am sorry that sucks a lot As a man it pisses me off when women aren t taken seriously or are treated differently for something a man would be praised looked up to for I can only imagine how tough that must be Sry  
Feminism,1615361125,Yeah that s what my impression has been I hope it didn t sound like I was implying there was evidence in the opposite direction 
Feminism,1615361022,On a philosophical level I would say yes biologism is always using  nature as the explanation so womanhood becomes a thing that is shaped by nature and not by society If you assume that there is no binary gender  which is scientifically correct you can t exclude trans women except your argument is sex nature  This is the same concept modern far right groups are using  ethnopluralism to justify their racism and sexism  for example the caring nature of the woman   the white woman needs to be protected from the sex driven barbaric immigrant etc or some climate change movements that tend to slip into social darwinism etc this has the potential for fascism but the main issue is that it supports fascists argumentation 
Feminism,1615360311,She is not a self proclained feminist  This question is disingenuous because she actually identifies as a  traditional feminist  whatever hell that means and is a critic of  modern feminism saying feminism no longer serves the interest of women  She s basically a Christina Hoff Sommers who calls herself a  factual feminist but is really anti feminist because she spends her life railing against feminism So calling Anna Bey a feminist while probably being very well aware she s anti feminist is disingenuous

Feminism,1615432665,I don t know if it s feminism exactly but you re right  I think the cultural divide between men and women in the US is different to the UK American men as the traditional target TV market in control of the remote are offered material they can relate to and aspire to like the  ordinary guy who is actually a cool guy in disguise and the  funny cool guy as well as the more aspirational  obviously hot cool guy  US women have traditionally been a market for TV advertising who are just expected to buy what they see and so they were offered aspirational tokenism fit for the male gaze primarily Men didn t want to see regular women on TV and women wouldn t buy their Nordstrom dresses  I think it s worth noting that the BBC revenue doesn t come completely from advertising I m pretty sure all most of TV station revenue in the US comes from advertising  and free to air television over there is fairly competitive 
Feminism,1615432330,cool and props for you to calling that  but what does having a need to dominate sexually has to be equal to rape the key word missing in a sexual act and rape is consent and that s the bedrock if two people consent what type of activity and with what dynamic they engage in it doesn t matter  i mean we might agree on this that beating a random person out of the blue just to test your street fighting skills is the definition of arsehole behavior but when you wrestle with your siblings for fun it s not arsehole behavior both are acts of physical agression but labelling both as  toxic masculinity and  boys will be boys is like comparing a tea leaf with a cup of English tea 
Feminism,1615431757,Entirely     in agreement This is an issue that really bothers me about American  and thus Canadian TV Men can be anything from stunning to meh but women are ALWAYS stunning In Canada we do a tiny bit better job with our  serious business programs   but yea It all sucks and I don t know what to tell you other than it s DEFINITELY not your imagination 
Feminism,1615431559,Same I m American and I have noticed this phenomenon for   years Good call y all 
Feminism,1615431447,wait you won t protect your loved ones and would instead argue and debate with someone who just slapped your mother sister out of the blue what s toxic in protecting your loved ones and teaching others not to screw over your loved ones  if you don t teach them a lesson they ll go on and be more and more open to attack others because they were never stopped 
Feminism,1615430383,it s not public opinion in the democratic sense where the majority of people have the opinion and so action is taken What happens is small minorities of people on twitter are being very loud which is then making employers cancel their employees

Feminism,1615427427,I am not from the USA and I do not now the details of all the allegations I think the democratic party went with the option of a not ideal white establishment guy because that is seen as and quite possibly sadly is the  safer option for getting more votes than anyone of colour any woman or anyone not from the mainstream political clique 
Feminism,1615427190, gt a guy slapped my sister and safe to say i got a bloodied face and he had to get his nose reconstructed a fine example of how toxic masculinity and patriarchy manifest irl yet according to you it doesn t exist

Feminism,1615420786, Masculinity doesn t only have negative traits It has lots of positive ones Toxic masculinity is meant to only refer to the negative ones Negative male gender roles might be a better word choice 
Feminism,1615420084,That is what then is the meaning of feminism Do you behave correctly and everything will be fine Nobody argues with this Don t tell others how to behave and admit that a girl can be masculine and a boy can be feminine Nobody argues with this Do people like to generalize Yes But this is a property of thinking We cannot get rid of it completely When you are a neural network forced to make decisions in situations where there is not enough information to make decisions this is simply inevitable At the level of thinking 
Feminism,1615418057, gt It is not true to say that  masculinity only has negative traits Toxic masculinity does not mean or imply that masculinity   only  has toxic traits The fact that you have to differentiate it from masculinity in general is the clue 
Feminism,1615417846,We can t vote the Supreme Court out And with Amy Coney Barrett we may now be fucked 
Feminism,1615417642,Aren t these same characteristics leading to male dominance in power and gender wage gaps It is not true to say that  masculinity only has negative traits 
Feminism,1615416647,Because white people and men already have the majority of the power It s really quite simple  Girl power Black power etc imply  yes let s have a share which we are currently not able to access   White power and  Male power imply  let s keep the majority of power which we already have  
Feminism,1615415663,Buy  why are men more likely to employ the methods they do compared to women  Why are their resulting rates of suicide higher Perhaps due to the lack of support and counseling they receive men are more likely to attempt suicide while in a deeper depressive state and thus are  sure of their decision In contrast perhaps women are more likely to still feel conflicted about their decision to commit suicide and therefore employ less instantaneous methods Men are also more likely to self medicate via substance abuse which may have an effect on how and when they commit suicide That choice to self medicate could again be attributed to a feeling that they must deal with the problem themselves rather than seek help You cannot simply say that there cannot be any relationship between suicide and social stigma surrounding mental health support simply because they don t attempt suicide more often than women In fact there is  plenty of data to show that they seek help less often and that this is correlated with holding more traditional views of masculinity  
Feminism,1615415586,Being male or being white already implies having more power because we are in a racist and patriarchal system  Claiming that a white person has more power for being white is to increase that difference in power and it is racist the same with men  On the other hand to claim that women or Afro descendants have more power is to reduce this inequality of power because it is to grant more power to those who are currently oppressed and expelled from the spaces of power 
Feminism,1615415502,Is this the    s  Are people still saying  girl power anymore   But anyway to answer your question   how many girls or even women have been popes bishops presidents prime ministers imperial powers warlords  hmm even that term seems to give the answer  or in any significant way had the power and force of the state to impose their will on others  Seems kind of obvious to me how that is different from  white power  
Feminism,1615414950,I think you re focusing too much on what you re calling basically  arsehole behaviour  An important thing to understand about toxic masculinity is that it s less about behaviour and more about the societal expectations that compel that behaviour the kind of thing you re looking at  is one example in which say a man is expected to respond to an insult with violence  or at least the threat of violence  or else he is weak and unmanly  But toxic masculinity manifests in other ways Just a couple of days ago a friend of mine ended up alone in the drink next to his upside down boat in an inlet in the damned Pacific with no lifejacket no radio and bad chances It was sheer dumb luck that another boat just happened to go past him and hear him yelling for help and plucked him  and his dog out of the water He d been in the water quite a while by that point and likely wouldn t have lasted much longer But just try suggesting to this guy  I love him but he makes bad choices sometimes that perhaps he should have a life vest when he s on the water and carry a handheld radio on his person or maybe attach his damn killswitch cord when he s running   good luck Because he s apparently more afraid of looking scared or not brave or not tough and specifically  not manly  than he is of death itself This is the kind of toxic masculinity that gets a lot of men killed  and nearly killed him on Monday Another example is men not reporting sexual assaults against them because they re worried that by asserting that they didn t enjoy it they re somehow not  real men  Or men not reporting domestic violence because allowing oneself to be abused by a woman makes one a weakling So we re not just talking about  arsehole behaviour here We re talking about a whole societal notion of what a  real man ought to be  a notion that can be held by men and women both  and examining just how destructive and at times lethal it can be 
Feminism,1615413605,I really dislike the term  toxic masculinity  mostly because I hate the term  toxic   but I think you re overlooking what the term is trying to get at a little bit Feelings of aggression are not intrinsically wrong In fact very few feelings or even impulses are wrong in and of themselves What s  wrong is the actions you take because of them It s not wrong to be angry but when angry is the only emotion deemed legitimate to express and only in specific ways that is very much a problem Your experiences with expressing your emotions or your friends experiences may be different and that s great I ve noticed a lot of younger men who feel comfortable expressing a wide range of emotions Personally as a queer person I ve mostly lived in progressive communities and while I ve had a couple run ins with homophobia I really haven t experienced all that much and don t usually even think about it when I m out with friends or partners But that does not mean that my experience is the same as other queer people Similarly where gender socialization is concerned there s research out there that paints a different picture of male socialization one which may not affect your generation but certainly affects many men in their late   s and   s If you have access to a library database you can search for this research yourself A quick search of my own brought up the following research  Confirming Gender Stereotypes A Social Role Perspective        which found that when men were put in high stakes and emotionally vulnerable situations they were significantly more likely to conform to gender stereotypes   Silence and  in visibility in men s accounts of coping with stressful life events        which looks at strategies men use to mask stress and anxiety and  Individual Differences in Masculine Gender Socialization as Predictive of Men s Psychophysiological Responses to Negative Affect        There s a lot of literature out there which is worth exploring  gt a woman can do a lot when she s all powerful Patriarchy is a  structure  not an individual Women can also reinforce patriarchy   and in the case of powerful women they often must do so to get where they are

Feminism,1615413416,Technically don t all actors always have makeup on in movies  All jokes aside you re right For the most part  There are exceptions The Walking Dead for example    thank goodness the producers were sensible enough to save most of the makeup for the zombies  Ok Clearly it s time for a nap Then perhaps we could all be inspired to write a more realistic screenplay 
Feminism,1615412168,What happened to u oracular duck If you don t mind me asking 
Feminism,1615410522,You were given an example of toxic masculinity being that men and boys are told to  man up and not given the emotional tools or support to deal with distress Statistically men are far more likely to have successful suicide attempts Men deserve to have the same level of support in times of crisis as women 
Feminism,1615410288,I ve watched the show some time ago so I have a fading impression The rape scene in the first episode The show touched the topic to show off it s gritty atmosphere which it lost right after While I think art can touch every topic this was done disrespectfully and only for shock value The female characters in the scene were drawn in a way where it seemed to fetishize the act The male characters simply got killed Regarding the fan service I remember it having the red haired farm lady with her breasts taking up half of the screen and defying laws of gravity 
Feminism,1615410252,I think that lots of man view the term  toxic  masculinity as an attack but they don t fully understand it It may not be the absolute best terminology but it is true  It is true that men have much worst outcomes when in it comes to suicide medical outcomes and can often suffer from mental health because they don t seek support Toxic masculinity refers to social standard where men must be stoic not show emotion and not seek out help Think of it more as gendered standards that are enforced on men and ultimately have negative outcomes When people say  remove gender from society they are generally referring to the erosion of gender roles For example men can do jobs traditionally held by women I would agree with you that there have been female world leaders that have done terrible things I think the fact that the vast majority the worlds leaders are men is the issue 
Feminism,1615409998,Exhausting yes but by r askfeminists standards I wouldn t call him a troll  Granted that s a low bar 
Feminism,1615409864,Even America had restrictions on male voting rights  So again feminists have spun a dishonest reading of history
Feminism,1615409799,Just because you personally haven t experienced it doesn t mean it doesn t happen but your experiences aren t the norm   gt men who rape are egotistical arseholes who feel that they can loose masculinity if they don t control the surroundings   But they re still men who are convinced that dominating women sexually is necessary to be masculinity That s what toxic masculinity is We know that but a lot of men don t that s why we talk about it 
Feminism,1615409512,agreed and it was especially bad around   s with all the govinda stuff raging I still don t think that it s upon the movies to teach kids the meaning of consent it s upon the parents and schools and that has been happening now also a bigger hindernce in putting it all together is the uneven nature of laws in India the laws around rape especially after nirbhaya episode tilted in favor of women  and a man still is mocked if he presses a rape charge against a woman  see honestly what you re describing is bad parenting it s upon parents and schools to impart that knowledge to teach the difference between good and bad touch and to teach the concept of consent but to address your point further if a woman rapes a man   i won t automatically say that she did so because of femininity or that it s toxic  that s where my gripe lies because suggestions like toxic masculinity gives off a vibe that it s somehow ok or masculine to rape which it absolutely isn t  also i hope you broke every fuckin bone in the body of that  year old bastard A similar incident happened with me where a guy slapped my sister and safe to say i got a bloodied face and he had to get his nose reconstructed 
Feminism,1615408776,Regarding your last sentence they know and they don t care If a woman dies from lack of access in any way they will blame her in some way shape or form The politicians who propose and vote for these measures have money and connections to get abortions for their family and mistresses if needed plus the pull to silence those who perform them They re about as  pro life as a land mine but no matter they ll be cheered on by idiots   Arkansas has a lot of abstinence only  sex ed and the highest teen pregnancy rate so as we can see their methods don t work Again no matter the results don t mean shit as long as you can pretend to be  pro life  even as the bodies pile up 
Feminism,1615408675,I m from India and the culture does not teach people the concept of consent As you ve probably seen Indian movies and culture in general normalizes stalking street harassment and sexual assault A  year old touched my little sister inappropriately when she was  years old This and other experiences people have shared with me tells me that sexual assault is not some isolated behavior of some arseholes It is a systemic cultural problem that women s rights are not valued No one is actively teaching boys to rape but many of them grow up without understanding what consent is because sexual assault is so commonplace 
Feminism,1615408302,and i respectfully diagree with that position I don t know where exactly is this thing of  emotions makes you less of a man going on I ve never seen this displayed once in person and the only time i ve heard  men don t cry was when i was crying in a friend s arms and he told me that in the most calm and caring way there was no force to stop me from crying only a suggestion that sounded more like  it s ok things will be fine  other than that i ve never once witnessed this idea that emotions make a man less manly in real life the idea is only visible in movies and even then it sounds like a projection to show the  Hero image  I agree and that s why i feel it s a stupid thing to suggest men who rape are egotistical arseholes who feel that they can loose masculinity if they don t control the surroundings i mean when has fear of lack of control a sign of masculinity I d go as far as to say always being uncomfortable in your surroundings and trying to make things the way you are otherwise it s a threat is probably anti masculine it s a type of behavior psychotic arseholes engage in 
Feminism,1615407391,or it can simply be that men are more effective at suicide like i stated more women attempt suicide but the methods women employee are weak if i am to accept your position then it should be inferenced that more men  attempt suicide when in reality they don t  men use methods like guns to kill themselves which is instantaneous death women use methods like pills that give them a window where they can be saved it s simply the effectiveness of method that s employed  to accept your position data must show that more men are attempting suicide    which simply isn t the case   
Feminism,1615407124,No this guy is a troll We don t want him in r menslib 
Feminism,1615406945,Regarding suicide stats show that men seek mental health support at significantly lower rates than women This is typically considered to be a result of the perceived stigma associated with men admitting acknowledging that they are struggling with problems like depression 
Feminism,1615406597,Oh definitely I guess my point was more  that if I m in a shop I don t mind people talking to me  if it s spontaneous about something random and not about hooking up dating To be honest I quite like those small interactions and have met a few good friends in very random situations 
Feminism,1615406517,  what about it it only shows that more men commit suicide than women  I mean i ve seen this thrown around so many times by both sides Look at the suicide rate   what does tell exactly women try to attempt more but men die more because of suicide as they employ effective measures the group with highest rates of suicide in     is still men aged       since you mentioned suicide here s another interesting stat the     figures suggest that life expectancy of men in UK is     years while it s     years for females on an average a female lives longer than a man       text Figure       Life   expectancy   at   birth amp text By          life   expectancy   in      see   Figure      How does that prove there s patriarchy in UK if anything it proves that women have it better than men and live longer in UK 
Feminism,1615406110,I just want to state that what I m about to say isn t an accusatory statement whatsoever I have a great piece of advice about her content if you identify as a feminist You know all the parts of Roma Army s content that you look at and deem as anti women misogynistic This is the same way many men feel about many feminists due to the ones that approach feminism in the way she approaches men s rights  and there are many women that do some going far enough to proudly declare themselves misandrists  Not saying all women who are feminists do but there are many out there that do The way a group is viewed is as an average of all the views of the people who declare themselves a part of said group Each time a man comes into contact with a misandrist who declares themselves a feminist it hurts the collect view and good faith of all the other feminists out there That s why it s so important to speak up about the negatives you see within the groups you associate with This isn t meant to be an attack on feminists this goes for men s rights activists as well or really any group We tend to immediately defend a cause from our point of view not realizing there are people out there identifying in the same groups as us but not acting right This is something we all know instinctively but I think we get so attached to our group identities we get in the us vs them mentality where we can t accept even earnest genuine criticism 
Feminism,1615406052,Yeah watch it again through a feminist lense It s pretty bad Even the way they manage and justify their career moves are through this gendered angle that isn t ever addressed or called out The whole series had a LOT of problems in hindsight It s an interesting time capsule 
Feminism,1615405946,I understand that But no couple can realistically be the  happily ever after Disney couple right It always seemed to me that the appeal of the portrayal on Marshall and Lily s relationship came from the fact that they were a realistic couple that yes loved each other deeply but would also act selfishly and hurt each other from time to time but always would end up talking through it They would held grudges for past actions but still try to overcome them But that might be an idealized version of them I have in my mind 
Feminism,1615405943,Perhaps you should look up the disparity between suicide rates of men and women in the UK There s your objective evidence
Feminism,1615404815, gt Victoria notably had to agree to never marry or else forfeit her crown  she wasn t the  virgin queen by choice or for fun  Victoria was married Elizabeth I was the  virgin queen   Is that who you re talking about 
Feminism,1615404812,I mean I think there are certain ways that social interactions absolutely do work to preserve inequality  I think that learning to  look out for these things can end up turning on you and becoming a new form of hyper vigilance for women and other marginalized people  So rather than pointing to specific things that are  red flags that someone isn t a feminist  I think it s safe to just talk about feelings If you are feminist and in conversation feel safe about honestly expressing that  then likely you are in a safe relationship with someone who isn t going to go out of their way to harm you on the basis of your identity or gender  If someone says things or behaves in a way that makes you feel unsafe or uncomfortable  you can try to approach that person and have a conversation about it and hopefully clear up a misunderstanding or some thoughtlessness on their part or if what they said or did is a boundary violation for you disengage and do your best to avoid that person in the future as you would anyone else who seemed to be making you feeling uncomfortable or unsafe on purpose The thing that s hardest is that you cannot always avoid or disengage and unsafe person or situation or sometimes because the situation is so unsafe  you can t even reflect fully on whats going on and might only feel that way in retrospect  that s okay You won t have the energy or capacity to respond to every moment what matters is your ability to eventually get to safety and to heal from difficult experiences  gt Which isn t entirely possible in loud settings or when someone is bombarding another persons mental state all the time If someone is   bombarding  another person in any way for any reason  all the time    that is the red flag That is that person demonstrating that they don t notice or care about the boundaries of others A person like that is typically not a safe person to discuss sensitive issues with 
Feminism,1615404746,Just  so many times they both treat each other like garbage    That with the backdrop and overtones of  all the other problematic   pieces and it was just    toxic Not a perfect couple   at all

Feminism,1615403645,i agree that s why i said ceremonial monarch and added the point of Thatcher and May 
Feminism,1615403570,But    let s  not catastrophise Keep  the vibes    positive    my dude  
Feminism,1615403393,Eh Victoria was not particularly politically educated and her first Prime Minister Melbourne was a considerable mentor to her and exerted a lot of influence  And yes there were something like twenty prime ministers during her reign  Prime ministers absolutely were a thing   Elizabeth II has never had any political power merely ceremonial  In regards to England   the Anglican Church didn t ordain women until      and women could not be consecrated as bishops until       Married women weren t allowed to hold property until       Women couldn t vote until      limited suffrage for women over   who owned property began in        Peerage laws still are male primogeniture not absolute primogeniture   with the exception of the monarch peerage titles and lands still go to the eldest son  Land and title passing from father to son and excluding daughters is kind of the most old school definition of patriarchy 
Feminism,1615403264,No i actually looked up for terms like  when did UK became a democracy and it gave a bbc article about the peoples act of       that s how i assumed it was a monarchy before that cause the Viceroys here in India were subjects to the Queen after UK took over in      i do admit that i made a judgement of error there though  i ll check out the menslib sub thanks i just hope they aren t radical because it triggers bad memories thanks again 
Feminism,1615402845,I mean you could read about Queen Victoria and the history of parliament and the prime minister on Wikipedia  It seems like you didn t even take  minutes to do research before posting baseless claims here and asking people to take the time to refute you  My advice to you in general if you re actually interested in learning about gender issues is to take responsibility for your own education  Find some articles books podcasts youtube channels whatever  If you make a polite request in a new post here or in r menslib I m sure you d get some good recommendations I m serious about checking out menslib those guys are pretty cool 
Feminism,1615402774,well thank i ll look into it a little deeply now  but honestly i still don t find it quite convincing that it was all due to patriarchy and that in case of Victoria there was absolutely no sway or control over her subjects her prime ministers were powerful sure but she still had a lot of sway over them  also i d like to add that i wrote for Elizabeth  the current queen and not the first one and that s why i said a ceremonial monarch because of the whole constitutional monarchy thing in her reign it has happened twice that the two most powerful positions in UK were both with women   first in the case of Thatcher and recently under Theresa may  bur yes i ll look more intothings you suggested thanks
Feminism,1615402442,Nope Victoria was not an absolute monarch at all  And Prime Ministers were very very much a thing during her reign  Walpole was the first PM and I think that was the      s 
Feminism,1615402130,Even if we had legislators with a spine there s nothing they could do bar pass a bill that d be blocked by a federal judge within an hour  Republicans covered their bases with this a long time ago In the   s they pushed for an expansion of the lower courts to ensure the SCOTUS never got overburdened which as it was a     moderate conservative majority at the time they intended to destroy the prior precedent for packing so that it could reign unchallenged and unchanged for decades Reagan then started the idea of swapping out the moderate conservative majority on that court with radicals that could serve a solid far right wing agenda but was blocked with people like Bork because the Dems had the senate Things then deradicalized for a few decades but now the GOP is back to those same principles and ideas and thanks to the lower court expansion   years ago have wiped out the previous precedent for court packing So the only way to stop them now is not to give them anymore seats  Breyer and then win the next few elections so that we can replace Thomas and Alito 
Feminism,1615402114,i did say i find some of it India but honestly i found none in London 
Feminism,1615402032,afaik Victoria was an absolute monarch and the concept of Constitution and prime ministers came much later  as for constraints i think those hold true irrespective of the gender of monarch   isn t it i mean it s a bit difficult to digest that a man as a king would hold more freedom and control over his subjects than say a woman as queen  i mean truth be told i originally intended this post for men only and that s why i posted it on askmen i have had a few bad experiences with some radicals feminists in past and i am basically someone who s in once bitten twice shy situation when it comes to someone who say they re a feminist A user told me to post it here otherwise he thought i am just circlejerking for karma which i never really understood If i wanted karma i d post a cat gif on r aww   anyways thanks a lot

Feminism,1615401870,If you can t see toxic masculinity at all in India or the UK you are deliberately avoiding looking 
Feminism,1615401828, gt Victoria was a monarch and controlled UK for a good  decades as a dictator even under Elizabeth the UK is a constitutional monarchy with the ceremonial head as a woman how exactly is UK a patriarchy when for the majority of last two centuries it was under Women first literally and then figuratively  Well if you know much about English history I don t know how you can point to Elizabeth as anything other than an example of how the country was very much a patriarchy then  Her father divorced his wife of over two decades broke with the Catholic church and beheaded a woman all to get a son  beheaded another woman for infidelity too and divorced another under the guise that she wasn t attractive enough though his own impotence was probably more of an issue there   That Elizabeth was the  Virgin Queen and never married was precisely because of patriarchy  Any man she married would have been King of England and the English absolutely did not want a foreign king and there was too much court in fighting for anyone to accept a fellow lord as King  Plus there was all the drama with the Protestant leaders especially those in Scotland having a big issue with Queens ruling especially if that made them head of the church as well  Was quite the issue for Elizabeth and her cousin Mary Queen of Scots  Just because due to her brother s sickliness and dying young her father s illegitimate sons all dying young and her older sister s death Elizabeth managed to get on the throne doesn t mean the entire system wasn t quite patriarchal   By Victoria s reign the monarchy s power was by no means absolute and the Prime Ministers during her reign  all of whom were men had quite a bit of power themselves  Worth noting too that at the time Victoria came to the throne married women were not allowed to hold property in their own name among a great number of restrictions of rights  That every so often due to deaths and lack of male heirs a woman gets on the throne really doesn t prove England was not a patriarchy especially if you look at the history of primogeniture and entail  I mean it s been in the   st century when they finally changed the rule so that the first born child of the monarch regardless of gender would inherit  Before that it was always the firstborn son

Feminism,1615401434,agreed but then i just don t see any evidence for such toxic masculinity happening around for most part neither in India and especially not it UK without giving out much details i went through normal schools and universities  had a healthy mix of men and women in my circle and i never really saw men not opening up  i mean sure  women were more expressive at times but men too in different situations the only time i can think of this expression of  toxic masculinity was during the infamous Delhi rape case when the interview of the rapist came out we weren t like   he is a male and hence he s toxic and scum    it was simply agreed that he was an arsehole and had it been a woman in his place the same thing would be said  that s what i meant when i said that the term toxic masculinity seems like a projection and i feel really put off when someone suggest  teach your boys not to rape  i mean come on are parents really teaching their boys that it s ok to rape or is it just arsehole behavior that s projected on men I am yet to meet men who believe that despicable behavior like rape can be justified in any form

Feminism,1615400977,I don t really feel like arguing with you about it Take me at my word or don t 
Feminism,1615400867,That doesn t have anything to do with what I ve said 
Feminism,1615400835,but extremes are and correct me if i am wrong   manifest only in certain situations and that s when it becomes arshole behavior innit sure at extremes aggression can be really harmful if it s used as method only to abuse someone   but that doesn t invalidate the whole feeling of agression as bad or toxic  no i respectfully disagree I mean i ve been around men s  groups throughout my life but i never once heard these expressions like  men don t cry taught as solid lines on stone for most part they were said with compassion and  a way to suggest  it s fine  honestly i ve seen all my close friends cry in front of me  ask for help when they needed and i did the same a few times the only difference i noticed was that the need was communicated non verbally and we kinda understood when interventions were needed  aren t we already doing that i mean some of the top most chefs in the world are men some of the sharpest CEO s and politicians in the world are women I admit it might be a little evident in India but in UK   i saw none of those constraints at least not in my workplace and industry  but a woman can do a lot when she s all powerful she can induce structures where more representation of woman is visible she can create laws and ordeals that might affect conditions of women if we assume that patriarchy was putting women at a disadvantage previously 
Feminism,1615400214,The term  toxic masculinity does   not  mean that masculinity masculine traits etc are inherently  toxic  The term is used to describe how specific ideas of masculinity are thrust upon men in ways that are toxic to them and to others For example being naturally stoic is not an inherently toxic trait Making a man believe that he must be stoic and not express his emotions lest he seem like  less of a man is toxic That man may have emotions that need a healthy outlet and if he does not think he should seek one he may suffer negative effects to his own mental health and or take out his emotions in unhealthy ways on others 
Feminism,1615400024, toxic masculinity was coined in the   s by the mythopoetic men s movement not by Gillette in       toxic masculinity does not mean that all men or masculinity is bad it is a specific term used to discuss aspects of traditional masculinity that when borne out to their extremes hurt men and others around them the idea that  men should just cry more is an extreme oversimplification the only socially approved method of emotional expression for men is anger we tell men from day  that  boys don t cry   man up   tough it out  etc like why do you think men are so reluctant to ask for help if they are suffering from anxiety depression etc  we don t raise boys with the emotional toolboxes they need to work through a lot of feelings and emotions that they  just like any other person  has  feminists want to remove gender is also not really the case most feminists advocate for the end of gender  roles  we don t want to make it so that gender does not exist or is not known we just want people to feel free to do whatever they want outside of the constraints of what we think men or women  should be do look like act like patriarchy    men bad patriarchy is also not disproven by having a female political leader if    of your government is male having a female political leader doesn t mean much

Feminism,1615464624,What is NOT wrong with objectification Objectification means that you reduce a WHOLE PERSON  with personality values ideals dreams opinions feelings and all that stuff you know  to their bodies and looks This is   dehumanizing    Objectification of women is one of the major causes why many women and young girls starting from the age of   have physical and psychological health problems related to their looks such as eating disorders anorexia anxiety depression  More importantly it is one of the building blocks of the notion that women are bodies and commodities that are owned by others and exist for others This notion is exactly the reason why women are not seen as equals and are mistreated abused violated  Their opinions and feelings do not matter because they are not humans but objects so I can treat them however I like  Sounds plausible right Consider how black people are still being mistreated abused and violated today because they were enslaved owned and not seen as equals by white people for centuries Consider the mass murder of the  uncivilized Native Indians by the  civilized white men and the mass murder of the  untermensch Jews by the   bermench Nazis Objectification leads to dehumanization which in turn leads to violence and social injustice This is not a far fetch but a psychological fact

Feminism,1615463129,Everything  But ok let me break it down  When you objectify a person you dehumanizes them which means you compare and atributes value as if they were the same as a chair When this is done in a structural level you literally considers less human even if they re the same species as you and sentient When women as a group are objectified men as the power holding group and majority think that they own these  objects   Which leads us to fathers thinking they own their wives and daughters and can say what they dress with what they can watch where they can go etc When romantic partners do this is the same and sometimes these objectification causes the death of these women who seemingly can t make their own decisions if these men don t approve it

Feminism,1615460843,This is not a grand theory but when I m sexually frustrated I can just well masturbate  If I want to have a sex with a person to me it s more more about loneliness intimacy excitement validation connection It makes me wonder if men conflate a physical need with emotional status and identity needs 
Feminism,1615460174,Women experience sexual frustration we just don t tend to have a sense that we are entitled to have someone do something about it 
Feminism,1615460137,I m a woman that occasionally dates younger men My stance  in theory is that anyone over    the legal age of consent here is an adult deserves respect and is free to do what they want with who they want  That said there is a HUGE power difference that comes with age it s incredibly difficult to navigate and very easy to take advantage of Older people generally have more financial resources more self confidence know more about how the world works It s very easy to influence groom or manipulate a younger person who is still figuring themselves out I ve been very careful and I m still shocked at times to see what kind of influence I had on younger partners and friends I shudder to think what someone with bad or even callous intentions could do I m guessing society thinks it s not possible to take advantage of younger men as easy as younger women   You can use them for sex but that s what young men want in the first place right   The most vulnerable group of young men I ve seen are in their early   s They ve just finished college they don t have a job yet and don t have a girlfriend All of their college friends are getting jobs getting married and moving away while their own life seems to be in limbo The seem to literally exist in a vacuum waiting for their life to start but unable to get it started They are extremely susceptible to an older person just taking them under their wing  So um   in short there might be infantilization of younger women but a relationship with a significant age gap is a power imbalance that should be taken seriously in any relationship 
Feminism,1615460028,I agree I mean lots of women go through the same and they don t believe themselves entitled to men s bodies

Feminism,1615458860,A commenter on this sub linked this article recently and it s blown my mind  How Extreme Need Leads to Male Entitlement  
Feminism,1615458573,In addition to the other comments it s also a good idea to offer to walk men home  Don t know the crime statistics where you are but when I was young and lived in a city the area where I and most of my friends lived had a big issue with mugging and not so much with strangers assaulting or raping women walking alone and I had some guy friends who were mugged  none of the women in my circle were partly out of luck and partly because we were used to practicing situational awareness when alone and learned to be more safety conscious  I would say there is a bit of benevolent sexism to only asking women if they need a walk home but I put that more on a cultural issue rather than a you issue  we certainly hear a lot how things aren t safe for women and often they aren t so it s not bad to want to help keep people safe So long story short nothing wrong with offering respect the answer you get and it s also probably a good idea to offer anyone regardless of gender a walk home if you are someone with really good situational awareness personal safety habits 
Feminism,1615458509,People are neural networks Humans are not artificial neural networks yes The point is precisely in the need for conclusions with a lack of information  And learning of course 
Feminism,1615458265,To answer this you ll have to look back at the history of how women and their sexuality was and often still is treated to this very day For women talking about their sexuality over history it s been seen as taboo Or they ve been called terrible names for being sexually independent and making the choice to have sex It s still an issue with people today A lot of partners are obsessed with how much sexual experience their partner has Or if they won t have sex with one particular person there s a chance that she ll be called a prude Even women who don t feel sexual attraction like people who fall on the asexual spectrum are often told that having sex could  fix them Women have been taught to handle their own sexual frustrations Whereas men are often still encouraged to talk about having sex in a manner that they are getting something that they should all experience This is damaging to everyone since many of them aren t taught to handle their own sexual frustration in a healthy manner And women are left to minimize their own sexuality 
Feminism,1615458154,Of course women experience sexual frustration But women are conditioned to not talk so much about their sexual desire for fear of being labelled a slut or worse 
Feminism,1615457770,This is definitely something that s true if you watch British television then you can see it for sure In American women have some ridiculously high beauty standards thrown at them all the time From advertisements television magazines anything and you can probably find that it only has the prettiest women plastered on the front telling women that THIS is how they can look If only they put in a little effort and bought the products As for men in television if they re wanted to watch it then there is usually someone relatable to them Or someone that they want to be This is why you ll see the range from average looking guys up through model looking guys With average men they can relate to them and with good looking men that s someone that they might want to be  Women aren t expected to relate to characters on their looks

Feminism,1615457407,You don t see older women dating younger men nearly as much though when it does happen there s a big issue of a power imbalance I think a big term in all of this isn t infantilization but a type of grooming If someone takes a young vulnerable and socially dependant person and puts them in a situation they can t leave from easily it s sort of isolating them from what a typical situation for them at that age might be If there s any type of power imbalance in a relationship that makes it so someone else can t leave easily then there s a big issue overall

Feminism,1615457371,My country South Africa should serve as an example to many Since the fall of apartheid in South Africa the representation of black people in the media has both increased and become more realistic and nuanced as opposed to only hearing the propaganda of a racist regime   However a shift in the political class and shifts in representation alone do not translate into big changes within the economic structure of society As a white South African I live in what is essentially a bubble of first world amenities Whereas the majority of the population  black still live in deep poverty This is the lagacy of apartheid town planning  which was a more extreme version of redlining     This racist legacy is actually very persistent and has little to do with the  racist or otherwise attitudes of people now I live in a monster of a house that is worth literally millions which I could never have afforded on my current salary But my grandparents got it under the apartheid regime dirt cheap because it zoned and developed land for white people  Now my black colleagues who work with me earning similar or even more cannot afford to move into my area just as I could not I just happen to live there in a house in the richest area of my city already so don t need to earn enough money to pay millions for a house Also my ownership of this property means I can leverage it and aquire debt  if needed very easily at favourable rates because the banks see that asset in my portfolio Whereas for my black colleagues with the same salary are unable to leverage to get the same debt at favourable rates Which means in South Africa white people still  mostly live in rich areas and black people still  mostly live in poorer areas Now in that the laws of the country are no longer racist black people have trickled into my neighborhood   They however are not middle class because middle class couldn t actually afford to move into the area they are often rich  Disney is NEVER going to critique society at the level of economic structure It sells feel good attitudes to people and is very happy with the economic status quo because it sits up at the tops of that heirachy 
Feminism,1615457201,There are a lot of things that come into play when you re talking about why it takes so long for something like this to happen A good deal of societies used to see women as second class citizens we ve moved up in the world but there s still a lot of stigmas It takes a lot to change the hearts and minds of everyone on the planet And sometimes that s something you can t do in just one generation Some people just don t want to see others as equal you can see different occurrences of this all over the place If they look and see what they re doing is wrong then they have to admit that for their entire life they ve been doing it 
Feminism,1615457003,The question that s relevant here is did she ask you to walk her home It s true that you should hold the door out to anyone who is coming behind you And you should talk about how a meal is paid for Split it pay for your own half or take turns paying for the meal The thing about walking someone home is they have to trust you enough to let you know where they live  Especially if someone lives alone

Feminism,1615456250,Dangerous people would also say all those things so that doesn t really help  But when you offer to walk her home it s nice to make clear somehow that her refusing is an option and not a big deal to you like um   Hey it s late do you want me to walk you home If you prefer to go by yourself that s fine too

Feminism,1615454266,If you are in a date situation there s some additional concerns the women in question might question your motives about wanting to walk her home After you walked her home you know where she lives You may attempt to invite yourself in or use it as leverage    Well I walked all this way the least you can do is invite me in     These are certainly things that run through my mind when a date offers to walk or drive me home Which isn t to say   Don t do it   But it s good to keep in mind 
Feminism,1615453201,Basically every human is indoctrinated into gender roles from before they can walk talk and throughout most of their lives Its really difficult to shift at large scales views that are so ingrained that they appear almost axiomatic to most people I think that to me the only hope is gradual incremental change over generations

Feminism,1615452056,I don t think it s sexist It makes sense for  on average physically larger and stronger people to protect physically smaller and weaker people women tend to be safer when accompanied by men and there is safety in numbers  The basic logic could apply to other situations  an abled person accompanying a disabled person or a person of the dominant local racial group accompanying someone of a less common group in a less accepting area There s only really a problem if the man views the women as inherently less competent and or tries to make her accept an escort  Not implying you ve done will do these  
Feminism,1615449452,A lot of media has a tendency to portray bigotry as actions by individuals towards individuals and the solution to bigotry as individuals changing their individual behaviors  This is a lazy copout Racism isn t just the kkk burning wooden crosses or neonazi chanting about Jews replacing them Racism is when Black men receive harsher punishments than white men for the same crimes degrading Black neighborhoods ability to recovery economically Racism is when doctors don t know what it looks like when a Black woman is in pain Racism is when Donald Trump gets away with serial rape but Anthony Weiner goes to prison for sexting Most importantly racism is a system most of us contribute to by participating in the institutions that impose it   Sexism is likewise systemic but I m not the best person here to go into detail about that  From that perspective Ellis is right bigotry can t be overcome with platitudes and tokenism because it requires us to recognize our role in it and work towards dismantling norms and institutions It doesn t matter how many people see a Black protagonist in Princess and the Frog if we don t address redlining and generational poverty  Of course representation has value which I assume that Lindsay mentions But representation alone does not undo oppression no matter how good and unracist unsexist we feel while watching it

Feminism,1615439991,In addition to ugly men appearing on tv and movies they also don t need to be good at acting  Talented women struggle to get roles if they aren t exceptionally beautiful or if they are past   years old Even if they do end up getting a role it is usually acting to be someone s mother or some other minor role behind a man  If a woman if described as ugly she usually is a gorgeous famous actress wearing glasses braces and messy hair and still by the end of the film turns out to be beautiful after all while the  lesson of the film being that looks don t matter  Anne Hathaway in Devil wears Prada America Ferrera in Ugly Betty

Feminism,1615438869,Actually i think there simply isn t much discussion of older women dating younger men simply because it doesn t happen nearly as much Interested in seeing other people s answers though 
Feminism,1615438651,Hey dude just wanted to throw out a thank you for asking the question in such a thoughtful way     I find  chivalry to be sexist and i don t generally like being treated different on the basis of my sex  But there are undeniable biological differences where the average male body is stronger than the average female body and then of course women are more likely to be targeted by sexual predators   So as a woman i have appreciated guy friends or partners who care about my safety and offer to walk me home 
Feminism,1615438221,I think the more precise question to ask is are we okay with this double standard White power and  male power  no one really uses that one have been historical phenomena with violent genocidal histories Whereas things like  black power or  girl power  a rather dated phrase represent an affirmation of the value of historically marginalized groups in society White male power seeks to dominate others whereas black girl power seeks to fight back against that domination Because recent history is worse with one it elicits a stronger visceral disgust towards it The problem I see is that shunning one while permitting the other does leave open the potential for people to abuse it like with redefining racism as being  prejudice plus power  which is clearly a self serving modality to excuse black racism While one wrong is worse than the other we should acknowledge that two wrongs still don t make a right 
Feminism,1615438068,Nope  I ve sometimes been walked home by others and I have walked others home  and I used to live as a man before I transitioned If things are likely not safe or if someone is tipsy or may not be able to defend themselves it is a pretty decent thing to do    If you have men in your life who are in a vulnerable state you better make the offer to them too  only making the offer to women can be sexist

Feminism,1615435492, I ve noticed it also   Others have commented on British TV  I ve been watching an interesting French TV dramady on Netflix  Call My Agent  about a talent agency in Paris  The difference between the women in it and those on many American shows is immediately noticeable  One of the lead characters would never appear on an American show because of her nose  Early on the show made a point of emphasizing how how American female actors are constantly pressured into plastic surgery when one of the French women is pressured and declines  I think the wide range of normal women on this French show is an essential part of this show s high quality by allowing for better character differentiation and depth 
Feminism,1615434389, gt rape is never considered  manly   Of course no one is going to admit to it When men are told that their masculinity is directly correlated with their partner count then you re going to see men getting sex by force This is what leads some men to commit rape and also leads to male rape victims of women rapists to be congratulated   Rape culture  I know you heard this term before is about acknowledging that certain commonly held beliefs result in rape and victim blaming    gt none of those behaviors are looked up as something to be positive    Yet so much rape persists
Feminism,1615433785,This is part of why I think I often prefer British tv shows as an American woman  that and I appreciate dry humor  
Feminism,1615433723,rape is never considered  manly  whacking a stranger on road for no apparent reason is never termed  manly  that s physical assault fighting your siblings for fun isn t physical attack and creating a submissive dominant equation between two consenting adult isn t rape  i don t know who s pushing this idea but no society or group of sane individual rewards  rape as manly behavior none of those behaviors are looked up as something to be positive about and this holds true even for the neckbeards who just want to fill their bellies with beer and ride their Harley 
Feminism,1615433590,I have noticed this as well In almost any British show I have caught people of all genders are only slightly above average in their attractiveness or average and it is their acting and character center stage That is not to say acting is not on point in American shows  it is but it definitely does seem there is more emphasis and necessity on having good looking people in the acting industry Some of my friends have noticed this too and in fact one of my best friends  who has watched a lot more shows than me pointed this out to me And of course that physical attractiveness emphasis and standard is disproportionately on women I do not know enough but I do wonder if this is a mirror to American society

Feminism,1615433217, gt but what does having a need to dominate sexually has to be equal to rape   Rape is about power that just happens to involve sex acts    gt but labelling both as  toxic masculinity and  boys will be boys   it becomes toxic masculinity when such behavior is considered masculine or manly
Feminism,1615479917,This is a great example of how gender roles hurt people Men are expected to be willing and eager for sex all the time which is a lot of pressure for them Then when women get their feelings hurt by being turned down in an instance they feel insecure because  men are supposed to always want sex and what s wrong with me that he doesn t want it with me   Not the point you were trying to make but I m making it for you 
Feminism,1615479875,When people sexually harrass a woman outside she may not be experiencing violence but what we hear from that stranger is  I have no boundaries or respect towards strangers and I ve noticed YOU and I ve targeted YOU  Anything can happen after that and it s terrifying 
Feminism,1615479806, gt many feminists refuse to work with groups like the MRA uh yeah we SHOULD be on the same side but they kind of fucking hate us their whole schtick is being reactionaries  against feminism and many  if not most of them are raging misogynists  gt egalitarians They re not a  group  They don t do anything They re just people who are at best fine with the status quo and at worst are just anti feminists who ve put on the mantle of  I just want equality to avoid looking sexist  gt even parts of the lgbt community What are you referring to here TERFs 
Feminism,1615479027, gt your data will be skewed by the fact that women fearing for their safety while outside at night may be less likely to be out late and therefore less likely to be victims of violent crime simply because they remain at home This is a super important point Women are also less likely to be outside  alone for similar reasons and thus are less attractive targets for robbery

Feminism,1615478824,From the abstract  Adjustment was made for prior mental health status   There was no significant association between number of sex partners and later anxiety and depression   Increasing numbers of sex partners were associated with   increasing risk of substance dependence disorde  r at all three ages  So it seems that the main correlation they found was about substance abuse not other mental illnesses This makes sense to me given that many drugs  especially stimulant like meth and cocaine can cause sharp increase in sex drive and decrease in inhibition leading to compulsive sexual behavior Addicts also report difficulty maintaining long term romantic relationship so it makes sense that they would switch partners more often than people with stable relationships 
Feminism,1615478652,In America  males experienced higher victimization rates than females for all types of violent crime except rape sexual assault   
Feminism,1615478313,Correct It s awful for all the reasons and often the acting suffers too I watch a lot of TV from abroad and I ve noticed this for decades 
Feminism,1615478262,Well if you re not interested in charitable discussion that is fine I never said all stories had to be economic or class stories did I  I never made any claims about revolutions you are putting things into my mouth and all I was trying to do was be honest and explain how I saw things You seem to be after a fight Perhaps someone else will be down for that   But not me well not today anyway 
Feminism,1615477955,Then you should be happy and thankful that Disney isn t trying to be anti capitalist Why do you want your revolution commodified Also why are people unable to accept that in a fictional world a monarchy isn t neccecarily an oppressive system like it is in real life since you know it s not real  So your saying that representation is a liberal thing and progressives generally don t see it as progressive unless it s in the       percent of movies that portray systems of oppression being dismanteled 
Feminism,1615477946,Agreed A couple of other possible aquatic GOAT nominees   Penny Dean   In      Dean swam the English Channel in      the first sub eight hour EC crossing in history  Her time was more than an hour faster than anyone had swum it before  I recall her saying that she could have gone faster but her pilot didn t believe she could go as fast as she knew she could So he chose a start time that given the tides wouldn t allow her to go faster than she did   Dean held the overall English Channel record for sixteen years and the women s record for twenty eight Only one person has held an English Channel solo record longer  Matthew Webb   EC swimmer    She was World Professional Marathon Swimming champion by a massive margin in      then went on to coach and help others make long swims She trained Chad Hundeby the guy who eventually broke her English Channel record                 Cynthia Nicholas   First woman to swim an English Channel two way        She beat the men s overall record by nine hours and   minutes Between     and      she was Queen of the Channel i e  she had swum the English Channel more than any other woman Allison Streeter took over in                      That s only a small part of what either of these amazing athletes accomplished  and in Dean s case  because she s still coaching  continue to accomplish

Feminism,1615477654,Men don t get bombarded with comments on how muggable they are every time they re outside Getting mugged isn t so common that men are raised with  top ten tips on how to not ask for a mugging   It s a different level of threat The threat of getting sexually assaulted or raped is very present every time you get street harassed  something that happens to women a lot It isn t the same with the threat of being jumped Also getting mugged is a whole different level of terror compared to getting raped

Feminism,1615477556,I don t really think this study shows that having multiple sexual partners is harmful or that  promiscuous sex causes or leads to depression anxiety and substance abuse issues I think what it shows is that certain risky behaviors and certain mental illnesses tend to coexist and having  promiscuous sex is classified as a risky behavior especially for women People with anxiety depression or other issues may self medicate which can include promiscuous sex and substance abuse Correlation is not causation here I also would like to know what the definition of  promiscuity is here People often talk about it as though it s some definite thing but when asked what that actually means don t seem to have a concrete answer Is it ten partners Twenty Thirty What about serial monogamy Occasional hookups or casual sex Some people think  five partners is  promiscuous  Is it I personally have zero issues with anyone having as much sex with as many people as they want provided the sex is consensual and they are engaging in mutually respectful safe encounters 
Feminism,1615477516,And being mugged is still influenced by gender I was mugged at knifepoint while in the woods with a partner a while back and he said a big reason he cooperated was his fear that I would be sexually assaulted Neither of us were concerned that  he might be sexually assaulted 
Feminism,1615477480,The question then becomes what you mean by progressive v standard liberal politics  Standard liberal politics is one which is only concerned with setting things up such that we have more women and black and black women billionaires They will set up some welfare programs unlike libertarians but finally when all is said and done the deep structural economic inequalities will remain Liberals are not racist but they are Capitalists Progressives as a political movement generally are like a Bernie Sanders or an AOC both are not racist and are interested in structural economic reforms   Reducing burdens created by massive inequality and setting up a system which minimizes the possibility of such inequalities to arise within the economy at all  Also don t under estimate Capitalism it will happily make a profit on anti Capitalist sentiment without blinking an eye Mass printing Che Guevara  a big anti capitalist icon on red t shirts and selling them to lefty teens from rich backgrounds is something Capitalists not only would do they do it  Disney s decisions with respect to all this is all about branding marketing and sales 
Feminism,1615477466,That s an interesting fact Women remaining at home for fear definitely needs to be taken into account Otherwise the analysis will be very much misleading
Feminism,1615477452,I mean a big part in why  equality wasn t achieved yet is that many feminists refuse to work with groups like the MRA egalitarians  even parts of the lgbt community
Feminism,1615477360,Yes so what Your try to justify and invalidate sexual objectification is getting weirder and weirder 
Feminism,1615477185, gt Men are way more likely to be victims of violent crimes when outside Are men more likely to be victims of violent crimes than women  when both are outside  or simply more likely to be victims of violent crimes than women are I ask because if you aren t comparing  men who are outside at night to  women who are outside at night  your data will be skewed by the fact that women fearing for their safety while outside at night may be less likely to be out late and therefore less likely to be victims of violent crime simply because they remain at home 
Feminism,1615477170,And that hinges on the definition of  object  does it not 
Feminism,1615477123,I would     rather be mugged than sexually assaulted or raped These two crimes are not comparable Someone taking your purse or wallet or watch or whatever sucks and is scary but you can replace those things 
Feminism,1615477045,I am neither a Democrat nor a liberal  though I realize some people use  liberal to mean  left   I believe that both Trump and Biden have a history of sexual assault as I suspect is the case for a large number of people wielding political power I like neither Biden s politics nor his history towards women I voted for Biden because US electoral politics is extraordinarily binary I don t consider elections to be my main theory of change and I don t think Biden  or the Democratic party will save us all I will continue to fight outside an electoral context for a better world 
Feminism,1615476925,You have to look up your local statistics I don t know where you live 
Feminism,1615476882,Haha this isn t about philosophy here You are looking into the wrong dictionary This is about objectification of people  
Feminism,1615476824,According to left wing people now respectful representation of women isn t progressive unless there s messages about dismantiling systems of oppression to back it up
Feminism,1615476754, gt unabh ngig vom Bewusstsein existierende Erscheinung der materiellen Welt auf die sich das Erkennen die Wahrnehmung richtet What part of being matter is dehumanizing As far as I m concerned everyone is always an object and objectification is the act of interpreting someone trough their object body alone without considering metaphysicals 
Feminism,1615476682,Yes it matters The point of this sub is so that people who come here can get a specifically feminist perspective from people who are educated on the topic Given that just yesterday you were asking to learn more about feminism and your demonstrated lack of familiarity with feminist discourse you are not qualified to give that perspective Your participation is relegated to nested comments only Further argument on this point will result in a ban 
Feminism,1615476583,That s correct There is also a handy picture example in the initial removal comment 
Feminism,1615476483,Objectification means  making someone into an object  Dehumanization is part of the definition 
Feminism,1615476361,Literally no one said that it s gonna fix everything But how does that mean that there s nothing progressive about it at all in other ways Also wouldn t you claim that Focus Features also has no interest in changing the economic structure that sets people at a disadvantage And yet they made a movie that tells the viewers that unionizing is good and storming a CEO s house is good So is it just Disney 
Feminism,1615476230,Honestly if you re adamant that objectification isn t dehumanizing there s only much I can argue  Humans don t see themselves as objects nor see animals or plants as objects A chair is an object a table a book But a cat is not an object it s a living being a dog is not an object At least for most humans it s this way as far as I perceive  If you don t think it is that s ok It s your opinion However women feel that is does dehumanize it Just because it does hurt you it doesn t mean it doesn t hurt others It requires empathy to understand this too 
Feminism,1615476134,No representation can be a good thing even without being attached to an economic critique People even those traditionally excluded from doing so have stories to tell of their lives that do not involve political or economic analysis   Allowing those stories to be told is good It allows us to see the humanity in each other But representation alone isn t going to be the magic bullet fix of the structural legacies we have inherited from our history Consider the one percent if grandfather s left the billions to grand daughters there would be more representation But the basic structure of wealth distribution would not have changed at all  Disney as I see it is kind of like that They have no problem with women or black people becoming super rich and moving into the    representation  But they have NO interest in changing the economic structure that set people at a disadvantage because they are beneficiaries of that system  I don t see disney as being  afraid necessarily more that a multinational organisation like Disney has no incentive to change how things are done having black and female executives is  good on the surface But the machine hidden beneath that service would remain largely untouched 
Feminism,1615475958, gt Objects are indeed required to be non living  anything that is visible or tangible and is relatively stable in form    something material that may be perceived by the senses    a material thing that can be seen and touched    in german but similar to before  
Feminism,1615475954,I feel like you re confusing liking someone s physical feature and objectification There s a clear distinction between the two Let s take your example You look at a woman You think she has a nice ass You approach and meet her In this example a couple of things matter First the look Is it a glance or a gaze Second the context Is this woman a business partner you meet in a professional setting Are you in a more comfortable setting like a party at a friend s house Third the encounter How do you approach her Are you polite Are you in a position maybe too close where you could possibly make her uncomfortable Let s say you see her at a party and think she is sexy In one scenario you approach her introduce yourself and start a conversation in a polite manner This is not objectification In another scenario you approach her check her out from head to toe and then say  hey sexy  This is objectification There s nothing wrong with liking someone s physical feature and being drawn to it This is completely natural There s nothing wrong with complimenting someone in a polite way either  obviously not like  you have a nice ass   What s wrong is to REDUCE people to their physical features consciously or subconsciously If you respect women and see them as humans you ll act like in scenario   If you subliminally think of women as objects you ll act like in scenario   Regardless of which both of these approaches are stemmed from your own perception of women That s why how you think of and perceive women matter quite a lot The thing is though while some men who have an objectifying sexist perception of women openly exhibit abusive and violent behavior physically and sexually many men who have the same perception of women do not act that way and they are not even aware of their own perception Objectification of women in media commercials movies porn perpetuates the notion that women are physical and sexual objects for male pleasure and they are not real human beings with their own desires opinions feelings etc As a result many men develop an unrealistic hypersexualized perception of women which manifests itself as emotional abuse and power play in close relationships and it harms women s emotional well being One example from my own life is my ex who loved me from the bottom of his heart acknowledged me as a person cared about my opinions Yet he used to criticize me for not being sexy      not wearing make up not being  feminine enough  According to him I was supposed to wear sexy outfits at home compromising my need of being comfortable in my safe space He wasn t even aware that he was asking me to act as a sexual object for his pleasure Objectification goes much further than it seems
Feminism,1615475721,I can justify calling the sexual harassment being bad because it can cause harm to the person I don t see the justification for calling the objectification bad without the definition of such making it inherently dehumanizing which is fair but not part of my initial interpretation question 
Feminism,1615475701,I haven t watched too many british shows A few which would you recommend  Definitly American shoes are gloomy looking men and beautiful young women as their partners etc unrealistic  We usually match with people who reflect our own level of attractiveness

Feminism,1615475656,OK got It no problem  I m not the smartest person and I m really bad with the internet   Englisch is not my first language   Could you please tell me what  nested comments are it s just not the first comment right I can still post as the second comment right  
Feminism,1615475587, gt I think you re confusing objectification in the sense of  to acknowledge the physicality of a person with the one that is meant when people discuss  objectification which is  to focus on the physical attributes of a person to the exclusion of all else   No I do think of the second interpretation but very limited in application The example I ve used to far being that I see a person in a bar or something and objectify them to essentially perform  visual attraction analysis if that makes sense I acknoledge the entirety of the person but only consider their physicality for that moment that is everything else is not part of my conscious thought So indeed reducing them to nothing but physical attributes but keeping in mind that those are only a part of what makes the person whole as well as not letting that objectification being a salient factor of your interpretation of them as a person in the long term  gt You claim to think about people s bodies without losing sight of their personhood thoughts feelings etc In which case you are not objectifying them You are thinking about their physical bodies sure but not to the exclusion of other factors That is not what is meant by the term used in feminism  and broader when people discuss objectification You seem to be on board with the idea that reducing people only to their physical traits and ignoring all else about them stripping them of thoughts feelings agency is bad So you a likely going to agree that objectification in that sense which is the one meant when people discuss how objectification is harmful is not a good thing and has the potential to be harmful That seems to be the conclusive answer

Feminism,1615474909,I mean   okay My life is perfectly fulfilled without children and yours may not be and that s fine It s not  sad  it s just different people wanting different things out of life It s also rather rude to assume that someone cannot or is not  educating and forming the next generation because they do not have children of their own That is far and away not the only way to contribute 
Feminism,1615474886, gt You plainly ignored the two sources I provided  How is conceeding that based on the alternate interpretation of  object  you can indeed call objectification bad  ignoring those sources They form a centerpiece of my argumemt now  gt However I think you do need to realize or at least respect that just because you don t understand a concept or a logic it doesn t mean it s incorrect  Which is why I have conceeded given the alternative interpretation of  object   gt Objectification is harmful to women Women feel bad bothered and disgusted Do you understand this If going by the definition of object that requires it to be non living i e objectification  is intrinsically dehumanizing yes 
Feminism,1615474741,So the only way for representation to even be a little progressive is if it s backed up by an economic critique And the reason why Disney doesn t do this isn t because their afraid of inspiring people to start a revolution or something They don t do it because they make movies that are supposed to be entertaining and easy to follow for  year olds
Feminism,1615474682,I mean I m a man and I like children and want to be a father Not that you have to like the same things as me just cause you are a women but a life without doing all I can to educate and form the next generation to be as good as they can be   Sounds kinda sad to me

Feminism,1615472577, gt Now I m starting to wonder whether you re actually here to learn or to debate Well both Debate is the best way for me to find arguments that I hadn t considered yet It seems that the discrepancy between my interpretation of objectification and the common interpretation is merely what objectification of a person actually means So now I just continue because I both enjoy it and to not miss out on other potential arguments I hadn t considered  gt I said groping and handling as we do with objects non living things Would you grope the microphone of a speaker at a conference Would you say no because such an action has sociological implications Would you say similar such sociological implications can be applied to human bodie as an object and a human body can thus be considered an object that doesn t automatically justify random groping of it  gt I linked two sources with the definitions I provided Sounds like you skipped those two then  I did indeed not do an exhaustive research of dictionary you got me there   gt Then what is the problem That I haven t heard a coherent argument so far that isn t based in part on my conjecture of parts of it I m autistic so it s very hard to me to see the lines of reasoning based on things people would consider to be  obvious social intuition The fact that people are downvoting me and your  Sounds like you skipped those two then doesn t exactly help

Feminism,1615472428,How is my opinion not  feminist women want older successful man that are higher in a social hierarchy cause of the patriarchy
Feminism,1615472422,I m offering up just a personal theory based on my own experiences I used to go to film school You learn about having an artistic eye You also learn very fast that  pretty people make for the easiest subjects They re more fun to look at in writing amd shooting the general population tends to be more willing to form a connection with a character if they re  attractive  It s all   very objectifying At one point in my life I might have thought  eh so what It s up to the artist to decide what inspires them If that happens to be pretty girls so what   But there s a massive problem in all of that One that s kinda so deeply culturally ingrained   I dunno if we can really fix it  we should still try and always work towards it   All that pretty people art all that forging connections to pretty people It makes our whole culture think of  men and women as those larger than life pretty people we obsess over We don t take people as seriously if we don t find them as attractive That happens to men and women but it s worse for women Here s why When a woman is pretty we dress her down we make her sexy Now everyone associates pretty with sexy There s no appreciation for beauty without sexy anymore in a lot of ways Now we just see women as sex objects   and we kind of always have They re  baby ovens that also do housework to a lot of people But women are just as capable as men are They can create the same art engineer the same machines play the same sports and lead the same countries But nobody cares about that We just want to see more pretty people If they aren t pretty why should we relate to them If they aren t sexy what s the point  As a former artist   I don t like that about the art world You could make a strong argument that the fault lies in commodification Artists get snapped up by companies companies use numbers People buy pretty Hey Artist Make us some pretty  But I think a lot of Cis male artists  myself included fall into the trap of only showing what inspires us   and that s usually sexy beautiful women That s just as sexist as a company in many ways  Hope all of that made some semblance of sense Still waiting on my meds to kick in for the day TLDR objectification is bad because it s dehumanizing Dehumanizing is bad for everyone 
Feminism,1615472279,Yes it is She is an adult Also keep in mind that statistically speaking the biggest threat to a woman s safety isn t coming from strangers on the street It s the man who walks her home

Feminism,1615471988,because a person is not an object they are a person you can make whatever bullshit philosophical argument you want but the fact remains 
Feminism,1615471549, gt It results in bad treatment because then people don t give a shit how you feel what you want or if they hurt you They just do whatever to you and then act offended if you object  How do you reconcile this with the fact that I objectify people but care about how they feel what they want and whether I ll hurt them  gt they don t see you as a person Why are objectification and personhood mutually exclusive 
Feminism,1615471178, gt How does touching something logically follow from that something being an object Now I m starting to wonder whether you re actually here to learn or to debate I didn t say touching I said groping and handling as we do with objects non living things   gt I looked up four dictionaries for this post and none of them mention that part lol  I linked two sources with the definitions I provided Sounds like you skipped those two then   amp  x   B  gt The point is that I don t see how the objectification is the objectionable problem Then what is the problem You ve came to receive answers and a feminist perspective about objectification if you want a debate then this is not the place 
Feminism,1615470650,I think you nailed it It really feels like feminism is in the process of jumping the shark And that s horrible because I don t want to see feminism go away There s much good in it  But it seems like all the years of generalizing men as     potential rapists is starting to have unforeseen effects on the younger feminists where they literally run from and become terrified at the sight of any male I ve literally personally witnessed at least three five woman I ve never met before in my life run and cower in actual fear at the sight of me in broad daylight It s insane  When half the population can t even function around the other half this is how society breaks down 
Feminism,1615470310, gt  treating something as an object As in to merely consider a given entity by it s physical manifestion in a specific instance context If I say  they have a nice ass then I m treating the person as an object a body in the relevant context of me only being able to infer things from visual inspection from afar  gt  the scope of objectification If I now go talk to that person then the horizon of things I know about that person grows beyond their objectification their body The scope of my consideration of them is now their body but also the fact that they study law and like to collect red lawnmowers That is it is not longer specifically an objectification but more than that because more than their mere object body is now relevant  gt Nothing grants the right to treat someone as an object  The reason that I don t grope people is not based on how they are more than an object but because I don t want them to suffer any discomfort harm and I expect society to return the favour to me in return  gt For example if you think that I am superior to you let s say I m your boss you ll behave differently to me more respectfully and carefully than how you would behave if I was your employee This navigation in our behavior happens at a subconscious level but is shaped by our own perceptions But that is only relevent if you consider something being an object as making it ok to grope it for example correct Since I don t consider that to be the case I wouldn t expect my interpretation of objectification to cause subconscious influence on conscious behaviour in a negative way like you suggest 
Feminism,1615470184,No you re right I was thinking about the same thing watching  scrotal recall  
Feminism,1615470143,Very true Lots of people have experiences that  at best  were questionable because one person is pushing 
Feminism,1615469501,Many people do because their prescribed gender role isn t what they really want My gender role says I should like children and want to be a mother But I d be miserable if I did that 
Feminism,1615469353,Conversely I think a lot of date rape   gray rape happens because one person is super horny and the other person didn t technically say no or try to shove them off or whatever so they just go ahead and do what they want A lot of people who are actually rapists thought of what they were doing as  seduction  
Feminism,1615469237,Hi your post has been because it s not a question and isn t really appropriate for this subreddit 
Feminism,1615469175,It results in bad treatment because then people don t give a shit how you feel what you want or if they hurt you They just do whatever to you and then act offended if you object Like if you go to a dance club and men just come up to you and start touching you and grinding on you without asking or even looking you in the face  they don t see you as a person they see you as a sexy piece of furniture that s there for their pleasure 
Feminism,1615469086,Yeah I think religions everywhere flourish on the suppression of women 
Feminism,1615469082,Yes but individuals aren t averages Should you only offer if you re actually stronger or larger than the woman you re asking That would actually be a reasonable stance but it doesn t have anything to do with being a woman I also think you can help simply through safety in numbers

Feminism,1615468422,Some Christians find it distasteful to join a religion with the word  Satan in it though and I can respect that 
Feminism,1615497350,Can you expand a bit on what a  gain is  Because strictly speaking I m feeling more comfortable using a fem avatar therefor I m gaining something 
Feminism,1615497282,Thanks for your consideration for my comfort I m gonna be honest I don t understand my reasons either Hypothesis are myriads and I can t discriminate the valuable ones from the others I just empirically know what makes me feel more comfortable What I also know however is that I m comfortable enough being identified as male as to not seek to be identified as something else However you also made me realize that my post was poorly framed How do you feel about this situation in general  Let s say in MMOs for example provided that the avatar isn t unacceptable  gear looking consistent with the task tackled as reasonable body proportions as possible etc 
Feminism,1615497152,I m not sure I understand ti be quite honest and that may just be me not having a decent enough handle on the reality of this But to me its undeniable that women and men face different perils so it stands to reason that there is advice given specifically to women I do understand that there are certain aspects that are needlessly used against women  blaming clothing choices etc   but surely it s agreeable that in order to better equip people with the skills to stay safe it is integral to provide them with the most relevant advice according to their specific situation 
Feminism,1615496526,Nobody s talking about Sue Bird She s played   years and counting for my beloved Seattle Storm and is a sure bet to make the WNBA hall of fame 
Feminism,1615495607,Exactly my sentiment If somebody walks up to me and says  you are either of my opinion or you are wrong and evil i walk away laughing Unless I already hold their view I ll not be any more likely to consider it either There are SO MANY ideological movements that utilize exactly that rhethoric I pass Best way to gain allies is the tiresome long road I fully understand and empathize that many people have done that dozens of times and have grown tired of it Expecting the rest of the unconvinced world to just adapt your view without question because feel like you have arrived at the ultimate truth has historically been a hallmark of a lot of bad ideas so naturally people will probably not be convinced Has anyone here ever had a case where that approach worked anyway 
Feminism,1615495399,So long as you aren t using deception to gain something or hurt someone I don t see the harm 
Feminism,1615495221,Being apathetic and or inactive is favourable to the status quo Those who favour a status quo which in general is sexist are part of the problem Because your  in actions FAVOUR the systematic oppression of women This statement however doesn t apply to all cases equally A large subset of people are politically voiceless or inactive because of their position  usually at the bottom within society these people are not part of the problem and may be victims in various ways to the problem 
Feminism,1615495198,Objectification as we mean it is behavior or thought pattern that opens a door that allows sexual harassment among other things On it s own in a literal sense it is benign Much like the word  scientology implies it is the study of science but is actually the name of a cult like religion and requires critical thinking to fully understand why it s not just  science  study  objectification probably to you sounds like it is  just about treating someone like an object and we re all just objects But it means more than what it sounds like and also requires critical thinking to fully grasp Because we use it in a way that and this is a social norm that MOST people agree on that we are not using the word literally like we don t use the word scientology literally We are talking about it as someone denying our personhood because we are an object not a person instead of what you seem to think it means that we are an object AND a person 
Feminism,1615495132,That s not entirely true IMO I have had many exes guilt me into sexual acts havebyou considered the fact that men feel that they are  less of a man unless they are always ready for sex Making sweeping generalisations about all women is bad regardless of the context 
Feminism,1615494987,there is nothing wrong with giving people of all genders common sense safety advice but the special list of things given  specifically to women to avoid sexual violence is more often than not just used as a way to restrict their freedoms and as a cudgel to beat them over the head with if something does happen the list is endless and always changing when really the only thing victims have in common is bad luck 
Feminism,1615494586,I hate violence against woman but people shouldn t be expected to pick up a pitchfork and torch or else they are a target That is really scary to me 
Feminism,1615494353,I think people only have so much time in the day as well If actively asked are you against DV and educating people in relationships on how to conduct themselves I think most people would say yes    But if you ask people how much of their lives is activism you ll find a majority aren t actively activists I think most people are trying their best with the time they can allocate to help a cause And I think if pressed no one is against these causes  Its just you also have to live your life 
Feminism,1615494247,This exactly There is world of difference between someone who passively discusses these issues with friends and family but doesn t go to protests rallies and internet trolls that claim to be neutral but spout whataboutisms all day 
Feminism,1615493957,I don t know if I m comfortable or uncomfortable with it because I don t really understand your reason behind this I don t need you to explain it to me but it s something you should be absolutely clear about for yourself because it seems like a very important part of understanding yourself  But to properly answer your question As long as you don t do it for any creepy reasons I don t think I would be bothered I would literally only wonder  why   so that question will likely come at you a lot Also depends on the type of avatar of course but I m going with the assumption that it isn t anything freaky Maybe it would be helpful to have a better description of it but given the amount of concern you re voicing I d be highly surprised if it s something unacceptable 
Feminism,1615493759,As you said there are a lot of issues that warrant attention on top of what we need to do to earn money and stay mentally and physically capable to live Like most quotes and tweets it sounds nice in theory I have another one by a German rock band  It s not your fault that the world is like it is but it would be your fault if keeps like this  But in practice all our capacity for certain causes is limited Is it bad to devote only   minutes a day  h    of your income Should that better be spent on poverty reduction Or climate change Is it bad if I go to a climate demonstration but not on a women s march In the end those are only subjective things and there is no objective line between silence and action What we can do is be aware listen to victims and step in when violence or degrading language is used in our vicinity I would even go a step further and say the tweet is actively harmful the words have no objective meaning but they are intended both as a rallying cry for feminists and an insulting challenge for non feminists No one can tell me that it will convince a single person who is not yet a feminist to become one As such the tweet broadens the gap between groups instead of advocating for feminism 
Feminism,1615493601,This I know the injustice women face is bad and I will step in if I wittness people saying dumb sexist shit etc but my active social and political engagement is on different issues that I consider equally or more important to me and humanity in general or where I feel I can be more effective

Feminism,1615493085,Yeah I mean I have no problem with the fact that conventionally unattractive people can t get on TV It s a visual medium that unfortunately just goes with the territory The issue I have is the sexism men and women should be roughly the same on average in terms of attractiveness  unless there is a very good narrative reason for this not being the case  
Feminism,1615493053,Got it I ll avoid it in the future This is my first day on this sub and I m used to arguing w nazis normally so I don t usually think abt it
Feminism,1615492780,I think Kali pretty much sums it up but I d also like to add that a very common excuse is misinformation or being simply unaware The thing about social issues is that you have to   choose  to be aware of them it s not so much that ignorance has and must be considered willful all the time but rather if we choose to give ignorance the power to excuse itself from being involved in social issues then literally NOTHING can be done because anyone can feign ignorance In other words someone ignorant to sexism might as well be complicit 
Feminism,1615492477,Well sure  everyone knows that violence against women is a problem What I meant was that people may not know the details  the extent to which it s a problem its pervasive presence in all forms of entertainment ways that they can get involved to reduce it etc Violence against women is so common in TV video games etc that a lot of people have just become accustomed to it They need to be educated and either or statements can be alienating to those people  My issue is only with the argument she used not with the cause itself 
Feminism,1615492167, gt a lot of people are simply ignorant about the extent and details of the issue At this point though you have to be  trying to be unaware of these kinds of things 
Feminism,1615492014,I have a fair amount of experience with healthcare both as a patient and a medical student The most helpful thing in my opinion is being very clear about your concerns and if a doctor doesn t take them seriously escalating  Making a list of issues is a good idea for any appointment If you go into it with a clear idea of what needs to be addressed it s harder for someone to brush you aside A good doctor will ask if you have any concerns that haven t been addressed but because many doctors are rushed it s something that gets skipped often Unfortunately the onus is often on the patient to bring up their concerns Another important thing to keep in mind is to not be afraid to get a second opinion or to complain about poor quality care Here in the UK hospitals have a patient advice and liaison service  PALS who you can talk to if you re dissatisfied with your care They can help advocate for you or help you file a formal complaint I ve spoken with them twice once after having appalling treatment by paramedics and another time when I wanted to file a complaint against my psychiatrist They are very helpful Another thing don t be afraid to change doctors Sometimes you won t have a good rapport with a given doctor It happens Changing doctors is okay They shouldn t take offense to it 
Feminism,1615491983,I don t like  either you re with us or against us statements generally It s extremely divisive and it doesn t invite curious inquiry It also ignores the fact that a lot of people are simply ignorant about the extent and details of the issue Being uninformed doesn t mean that you re maliciously refusing to take up Jamil s cause but that s what I hear her imply in her quoted statement I also find an element of self righteous gatekeeping in these types of statements too They just turn me off entirely 
Feminism,1615491691,Yeah idk maybe we mean the same thing here maybe we don t so I ll just explain what I ve seen from experience Maybe that helps    I don t really think  women as an entire demographic is the thing to focus on I am in a year with    female students Most of them being white and from rich backgrounds Those are not interested in changing the very thing that guaranteed them a spot And a lot of them have a strained relationship with feminism  at best  plenty are happy to support anti feminist views because   privilege  So   what would actually help a lot more than simply having any women at all is trying to remove barriers and have more BIPOC women more queer folks more folks with disabilities and so on The more diverse a student body is the more the curriculum will have to change to acknowledge different needs  hopefully  Because in the current environment privileged women thrive the same way men do and don t speak up to change things 
Feminism,1615490954,I think having women in medschool will change things But in my assumption I do not think women will be a passive presence therein Women will and must use their voice when in medschool and in medicine  I could have made that clearer

Feminism,1615489292,I am not sure you read long term correctly If you are suggesting that this status quo is inevitable and demographic shifts and new perspectives will in the long term amount to nothing   Well I disagree Over the last hundred years a lot has changed Over the next hundred years a lot more will and can change  How things are is not immutable and in the long term it will change And demographic shifts and the demand for recognition will continue to push things along None of this long term stuff requires women  in general to be immune to anything  Women fought against women getting the right to vote And the idea of women not voting was  hard in how people thought   Still it changed So your statement of how hard it is or will be doesn t mean on the long term things will not change 
Feminism,1615489173,I don t think it s bad to ask in general It s true that dangerous people would say all those things Which is a factor in why a woman might say no Obviously since you re asking this out of genuine concern Im gonna assume you re not dangerous But the person you re asking probably won t know that So If you re polite about it and she says  No thank you  Just wish her well and part ways
Feminism,1615489132,Yes you are part of the problem because social correction is essential to form a society If you don t step in you signal the perpetrators as well as the victims that what happens is justified and ok These things happen all the time and no one gets punished often to the contrary get cheered on because people who believe to be on right side shut up Women can t avoid it so you can t either

Feminism,1615488469,I ve recently started to have more success in getting doctors to listen to me and it s a bunch of garbage bullshit that no one should have to do and I only have to do it because of patriarchy and fatphobia  BUT that being said I do have a couple things that I ve found really really helpful  amp  x   B For one I ve tried not to catch my doctors off guard about any of my questions  Especially when you re dealing with chronic conditions or weird symptoms it s impossible for the doctor to know off the top of their head what is causing it  And a lot of those things feasibly  could be caused by anxiety or stress or weight or whatever and if you catch them off guard with it saying it s probably one of those things significantly simplifies their job and it s really tempting to do So what I do is the day before any doctor s appointment I either use the online patient portal or the telephone to reach out to the office and say  Hey I m looking forward to my appointment with Dr So And So tomorrow  Can we put a note in my file to make sure to leave some time to talk about specific medical problem  It s really been concerning me lately   Then your doctor knows it s not just an offhand concern it s really bothering you and they ll be able to come in prepared with some more nuanced less under pressure thoughts for what it might be  amp  x   B Another thing that s been really helpful for me is to be completely     respectfully behind whatever my doctor thinks the problem is and be willing to take whatever actions they want me to take but to make sure that I continue asking follow up questions to be sure that my problem won t be swept under the rug So you say things like  OK I ll definitely try to lose some weight to help my knee get better  Are there any signs I should look out for that indicate that it s getting worse or might be caused by something else  Do you think it would be beneficial for me to see a nutritionist to aid in weight loss  At what weight would you be concerned that my knee had some kind of problem other than weight  If it s still like this after  months should I check back with you  Give the impression that you re     down with the plan of  try your idea first   But make sure that that s being treated as a testable hypothesis with a specific instruction for  Do X  If it doesn t work in the next  months call me and we ll try something else   amp  x   B And if your doctor does even the bare minimum of listing to you and addressing your concerns without shuffling you out of the room go on google and write them a GLOWING review where you specifically mention how well they listen to your concerns when so many doctors don t listen to women  They will listen to you   times harder next time 
Feminism,1615488207,Sadly having more female students doesn t help Our education is racist and sexist and you ll find less women the  higher you go up the hierarchy So those who dictate treatment guidelines for hospitals and influence how patients are treated on an individual basis will probably be overwhelmingly male for a while regardless of student populations  Female doctors and medstudents aren t immune to bias Not even bias against their own gender And medschool drives those points home  hard  
Feminism,1615488182,Don t tell demonstrate A  neutral conversation allows doctors to ignore you acting it a little out makes them compassionate It sounds silly but I got the best results by pretending to be extra sick and complaining like my life depends on it 
Feminism,1615487993,I ll go with German writer Erich K stner on this one  All mischief that happens isn t only the fault of those who do it but also the fault of those who do not prevent it  Preventing it can look like actively stepping in But it can also be just educating others and being vocal about opposing something If you stand by while people are experiencing violence it doesn t phase you enough to care So yes if you ask me staying silent is condoning it Where exactly I d draw the line of  doing enough I can t say But if you do nothing at all you re complicit 
Feminism,1615487699,You seem to be very confused about what feminism is and what it s saying in the first place 
Feminism,1615487547, If you are neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppressor If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality  
Feminism,1615487406,In this  century  Okay The right to vote       The pill        the right for married women to obtain contraception        and the right for unmarried women to obtain contraception       The Violence Against Women Act       Marital rape declared a crime       Title VII which bans employment discrimination based on sex       Title IX       Roe v Wade       Lifting the ban on women in combat       Maintaining the existence of Planned Parenthood  ongoing Bringing attention to  date rape            MeToo            those are pretty major wouldn t you say 
Feminism,1615487371,Are you referring to women who have encountered problems related to how others have treated them based on their bodies or gender 
Feminism,1615486792,Give me ONE think in this century in let s say America
Feminism,1615486562, femminists by definition cannot be misandrists yeah there are jokes about being misandrists that some feminists make  I even know a man  w a  misandry now t shirt but by definition feminists cannot be misandrists And TERFs aren t real feminists either Feminism is for all women and trans women are women and are born  mentally as women TERFs also tend to be racist and antisemitic too so again they cannot be feminists either 
Feminism,1615486238,I wont deny that in the current day too much activism consists of sensationalism and virtue signaling This goes for all groups There are some flaws in the modern feminist movement sure Though at the end of the day you can t deny feminism has done exponentially  more good for the world than MRA s ever had 
Feminism,1615486173,I watch them with fascination I only know a few And even years later I m flabbergasted when they pull out a vacuum or know who the pediatrician is They re like goddamned unicorns 
Feminism,1615485836,I disagree but that s not that important the point is   current feminist groups are pretty terrible          blaming the patriarchy for their problems instead of solving anything  see what I did there  
Feminism,1615485116,You said nobody hates feminism but most people like equality and now you re saying there s a lot to hate about feminism and that s why they re having such a hard time achieving their goals Which is it 
Feminism,1615484921,And that s why feminism has such a hard time achieving equality that s the point   bud
Feminism,1615484680,After some bad experiences what I have done is I make a list of concerns questions before I go in  particularly if I m seeing a new doctor   and I m very annoying about not leaving until I get them all answered The other thing I do  which I know doctors hate but I have had too many just straight up blow me off  is do a little bit of research re the diagnostic testing needed for what I suspect might be the issue I then tell the doctor about my symptoms and if they don t recommend following the diagnostic protocol I ask them too If a doctor refuses to take me seriously after that I change doctors I have had problems with both women and men doctors  typically though you ll have better luck being listened too at a smaller practice rather than someone operating out of a large hospital and with a DO rather than an MD  Other than that  just be prepared emotionally and psychologically to be persistent 
Feminism,1615484621,Current MRA groups are pretty terrible That s not to say their can t be effective men s rights groups but most of the current ones seem more intent on blaming feminists for their problems instead of solving anything I would say that in order to achieve full equality both men and women need to break free from the current coerced hierarchy related to sex but I don t think MRA s will play any meaningful role in that 
Feminism,1615484558,In the long term the demographic shift underway in medicine that is seeing more women entering into and graduating with degrees in medicine is probably the best bet In the short term basically refusing to be ignored is all I can think to say

Feminism,1615484019,Can t argue that I m sure people like that exist it s just there s a difference between the movement and it s representatives   Like you d agree that a terf isn t exactly who you d want to be associated with  For someone looking at the movement from the outside   how should they know not everyone is the same  there s a lot to hate about feminism just like other groups like mgtow or MRA or whatever 
Feminism,1615483728,So is it bad to ask in general I was told this by another person in the comments  Dangerous people would also say all those things so that doesn t really help But when you offer to walk her home it s nice to make clear somehow that her refusing is an option and not a big deal to you like um  Hey it s late do you want me to walk you home If you prefer to go by yourself that s fine too     Does that work here under the advice you have given me Or is it better not to ask if they simply didn t ask me themselves 
Feminism,1615483324,Do you feel similarly about the pride thing White or male pride almost seem to be exclusively seen as racist or sexist while any other combination other than white or male seem acceptable

Feminism,1615483073,Absolutely not nobody hates feminism some people hate some feminists  like feminists that are misandrist or trans exclusionary while the egitarian movement doesn t necessarily exist more people believe in egality than feminism cause of the unlikable loud minority

Feminism,1615482136,That s absolutely the point I tried to make thank you for wording it better  English is not my first language 
Feminism,1615480960,When I was in my   s I    f realized that men were probably more likely to be involved in a violent incident at night  But I was repeatedly told to  not go out alone   All the time  By a wide range of people It pissed me off  It felt like society was using some sort of mystery boogey man to control me and keep me docile and at home  When the truth is my greatest risk of sexual assault is from men I have some sort of relationship with So I started going out alone  Walking around town late at night  Traveling Hiking You name it if I want to do it I will do am honest risk assessment and go do it    I am aware that there are risks to solo activities and sometimes the reward is not worth the risk After   years and multiple cities in North America and Europe  stranger put his arm around me another  masturbated in front of me  But guys I know have committed sexual assault sexual coercion unwanted physical contact   various things  at the end I feel safer among strangers out in the open where I can separate myself than in an enclosed space with casual acquaintances 
Feminism,1615480671,Ever been mugged Because I have twice The second time they didn t even ask for anything They just knocked me down and beat the living shit out of me before even trying to take anything I was off work for two months Know what literally everyone  the cops the doctors my friends my family my wife  said to me constantly  What were you thinking walking alone that late How drunk were you Well what did you  expect   The idea that no one blames men for their own victimization is a complete myth The experience is absolutely not unique to women 
Feminism,1615480643,I think it s important to remember that victims of violent crimes that were reported to the police of both genders are a very small minority of the population  It s a very small number of people who are like  this happened to me or I saw it happened to someone else and now I am scared   That s not the primary driver for feelings of safety or lack of safety The primary driver for people s feelings of lack of safety are their actual experiences  And I think that women are overwhelmingly more likely than men to encounter non violent threats outside the home unrelated to their own behavior  If someone catcalls you if someone follows you home but doesn t actually hurt you if someone whispers something sexual in your ear on a train often even if you re groped in passing  Those things almost never get reported to police and especially they don t count as  violent crimes   And most women have had an experience with something like that in places that most people would consider  safe   They ve had a male stranger follow them or make uncomfortable advances towards them in a coffee shop on a crowded train in a well lit bar in the supermarket at the gym walking down a busy main road in broad daylight  These smaller scary ways that men victimize women happen in places that are supposed to be safe and they happen to almost all women at some point in their lives In my experience men and women both feel fear when parking in a dark alleyway far from the bar when walking alone in the woods when passing a shady looking character on the street  But I think that women more than men are frequently reminded that even places that are normal and safe can be very dangerous to women  That guy who followed you in the mall could follow you into the parking garage and murder you and even if he didn t you always know that he could have  amp  x   B Also a nonzero percentage of the male number can be attributed to perpetrators of violence being more likely to be victims of violence and a majority of perpetrators of violence are male  So like if  dudes start fighting eachother in a bar with no women in it that s  men who are victims of a violent assault  I think in general non perpetrator men are still more at risk for violence outside the home but it does inflate those numbers a little 
Feminism,1615480622,Men can put up a fight this gives us a lot of peace of mind But being a woman at the mercy of half the population which by and large lusts for you Wouldn t you be scared 
Feminism,1615480389, gt Okay so it s not inherently sexist to want to It s not inherently but it  can be sexist  It ultimately depends on  why you want to and how equal you are in your desire to help women who may benefit from your help vs other people that may need your help 
Feminism,1615479955,Most muggings occur at night and fewer women are out at night in the first place 
Feminism,1615479927,Your stats is flawed As other comment pointed out women are more likely to not go outside at all in fear of being assaulted Also men participate in violence at greater numbers than women so consequently they suffer more from this violence  You should compare pure numbers of men and women going outside and how they are assaulted and harassed Funny how you didn t include the latter in your stats because even if women aren t assaulted they are catcalled and creeped on by men which is intimidating already A threat of assault is always there even if it doesn t necessarily result in assault 
Feminism,1615508629,It is a great quote but I don t think it applies as well to those who are in charge of selection of candidates as well as it does to the voting by the general populace If those selecting candidates don t try to find someone a bit better than the best old white guy from a stack of mostly old white guys things are not going to improve They bear more responsibility for the candidates 
Feminism,1615507735,But you assumed I wasn t a feminist by asking that question and saying that You see that right 
Feminism,1615507591,Did you know that there s been an epidemic in the United States of Native American women going missing or becoming victims of homicide In     alone over      Indigenous women went missing   How many of their names  stories do you know  How many of those women even made it to the local news let alone the national news 
Feminism,1615507229,I do think media in general focus more on white people And white women s tears are really alluring to the media like a moth to a flame  However I think this case in particular seems to be one of those where the circumstances or even just the timing is propitious to become viral I ll be more than happy to see the tweets you saw to read what POC s think about this particular case  I myself do not think I m a white woman per se however  I don t think I have a say on women of color s opinions It s difficult for me to know my  place  
Feminism,1615507036,Every person regardless of gender has a moral obligation to intervene when they see injustice occurring I m not a man I m physically fairly weak and I m someone who has their share of trauma around issues of violence I ve also intervened in a number of situations where my physical safety was at risk in doing so because intervening could help prevent someone from being seriously injured I do not think this behavior is exceptional or that it s unreasonable to expect people to intervene Just as many high schools require CPR public education should cover bystander intervention 
Feminism,1615506754,You didn t ask anyone else this question but you asked me Fine I ll assume you were just genuinely asking    How old are you And it seems you re very keen to insult me anyways As if you re looking for an excuse Be my guest It s unproductive but it s a free country insult me if you want I m not gonna be a baby about it

Feminism,1615505916,This may be a weird comparison that doesn t fly but this kinda reminds me of the British royals to me they are greedy privileged family who s wealth and power should be disbanded as monarchy s are undemocratic and they get everything they want in life which is true but on the other side as seen with Meghan and Harry it comes at a great cost to their freedom mental health and what they are allowed to even say if it goes against their privilege if it can damage their image and thus power The comparison isn t deep or exact just something my brain fed me

Feminism,1615505809,Do you know why one of the most common terms we use for good people is  selfless  
Feminism,1615505741,That s not what I said   It has nothing to do with your gender it has to do with your understanding of feminism Keep arguing with me though 
Feminism,1615505410,I don t think the majority of men who are  neutral have much interest in feminism especially if they have never looked into it There s plenty of feminist who talk about the ways it helps men Do you think white people are put off dealing with racism by the protests at some point to get real change there s going to be uncomfortable things that happen and uncomfortable discussions What if talking about male privilege puts them off can we not have those discussions then It sounds like the same attitude given to gay people who wanted marriage  don t ask for too much it s not the right time to treat you guys as equal yet it s never the right time Progress usually comes with backlash  Women get angry over our lifetime of oppression but I ve only seen the  everyday is men s day in response to men s sarcastic response to women s day Those kinds of men aren t interest in being nice or converting to feminism 
Feminism,1615504794,You sound like you care about being a good person and a good friend  I don t know if you can help your friends but you can help yourself  A counselor can help give you tools to reduce remove intrusive thoughts  ones you don t want and negative thoughts  I didn t want to go too far and say low self esteem but a few things you said made me wonder   And for the record that teacher IS a jerk It doesn t help anyone to put people down 
Feminism,1615504389,Here s my problems with it   She s wrong that Disney didn t show things like the monarchy being overthrown in Aladdin and Dumbo being remade to be about how racism is evil because they are afraid of people turning against oppressive systems that they benifit from The reason why they did this is because they are adapting pre existing stories and adding these things would not have made sense within the context of the story whatsoever    Why can t a fantasy world in which good capitalists or good rich people exist They don t exist in the real world but this isn t the real world   She seems to be less bothered by this stuff in the originals due to nostalgia   She s wrong that representation in itself isn t progressive

Feminism,1615502508,Upstream strategies Get more women in medicine particularly in leadership positions Ensure that students are taught more effectively about women s health and also about unconscious bias Downstream strategies Be assertive Seek second opinions Use the phrase  please note on my chart that you refused to  run x test etc    Do some research not so you can tell doctors what to do but so you can ask good questions  e g is it worth considering x what about y test etc   be aware of some of the common biases so you can be on the lookout 
Feminism,1615502429,To be clear the comment does not represent something  feminists have done  There is nothing wrong or weak about liking and doing things traditionally associated with femininity but to say that feminists have characterised it like that is just untrue  This is just to inform you not to attack you for reply to them

Feminism,1615501739,reading your responses here was exhausting sounds like you weren t engaging with anything said and just want to shoot off more and more questions lmao your in like constant attack mode and your ears are shut
Feminism,1615501561,I disagree with the text you quoted If you are an oppressed minority other than a woman your first priority is to your own struggle cause As long as you are being oppressed you owe other oppressed groups nothing Your strength and energy should rightly go to your own struggle first and foremost It is either a case of white privilege cis oppression or ableism if other groups demand to siphon off your energy to their own cause while you are struggling with your own discrimination and abuse This seems like the idea of some privileged white feminists who want to coop the energy of other oppressed minorities and flip it over to feminist cause I find it a really sketchy and underhanded tactic 
Feminism,1615501343, gt Because feminist have equated femininty with being weak and conforming to the standards men set for women  Wearing a dress heals and makeup is seen as catering to men  This is not accurate 
Feminism,1615501106,You are correct Women are thought they should be on tv because of how pretty they are That is first Acting ability comes second And there are so many guys on tv that if you met them on the street you would never look at them twice much less want them to look at you Vince Vaughn comes to mind Not exactly attractive overweight looks like your typical loser dude on the sofa and he doesn t even act that well Everything I ve seen him in is just about the same char But they pair him up with Jennifer Aniston who can act has a slim body and is gorgeous He should be paired up with Rosanne  people on the same attractiveness side not ugly but not Jennifer Aniston   But there are a lot of those pairings It s also harder to relate to women onscreen if somewhere in the back of your mind your thinking they are perfect it makes it a little harder to sympathize One of my favorite shows is on BBC The Split Nicola Walker plays a lawyer She is brilliant I always feel lucky to be able to watch it with her because she  would never be allowed on us tv She doesn t look like a supermodel and she make me  think of how many other actresses that would make a show a standout because of their acting ability  but aren t allowed because their attractiveness level is only that of Vaughn To be honest I think she is more attractive than him but she would never be on US tv 
Feminism,1615501069,Women generally have other outlets for sexual frustration like cats and sex toys men utilize sex in a different way and there s really no good substitute for a woman wanting you intimately Further more the average women can have sex anytime with somebody My ex had  guys lined up the day we broke up Im still single decades later
Feminism,1615500795,I understand where the confusion comes from especially because blanket statements like  if you re not with us by definition you re against us are not very open minded I think what she means though is if as a man you talk about how women deserve rights but when women accuse others of rape assault when they march for rights if no men step up to speak in support they re not really doing much They can say all they want about women s rights but how many men have stepped up in support of Evan Rachel Wood of Rose McGowan of all the women who scream that they ve suffered violence It s always the women The men stand back like they re just letting women do their thing But they have to raise their voice too Call out men who abuse You don t need to witness it to interrupt the violence Simply believe women fervently and use your privileged cishetero platform to call out the violence and demand justice Like male celebs need to be at MeToo marches and events at TimesUp events If Charisma comes out to denounce the monster Whedon David Boreanaz and Nicholas Brendon need to do more than say oh that s so sad I m sorry They should demand they deplatform Whedon Brendon s oh he s my friend is bullshit Help women fight the violence or admit you re just pretending to believe women They can t have their cake and eat it too Men are so bro ey in that They respect other men so hard that they can t respect women more and support them           and yell it from the rooftops The time has come and gone for women to be apologetic of men as bystanders They either do it or they don t Notice how quick women are to defend and believe women they ve never met Men don t do that They only give their two cents when it s a friend If that I wanna hear Hugh Jackman Martin Scorsese Chris Pine I want all these men with large platforms to come out and say I believe her and I support her They have nothing to lose They re men The most privileged bunch But they don t It becomes a oh no comment I don t know the story The same turning of heads when they see a drunk guy at a bar force himself on a woman or yell at his girlfriend It s like there s a written code to be loyal to each other It s stupid and we shouldn t let these men just get away with it 
Feminism,1615500788,Oh you re spot on with that They aren t inherently safer it s more like an admittedly biased brain filtering mechanism You filter people based on trustworthiness and a man playing as a woman automatically gets a  deception point added to his list even if it s obvious that he is a man But I personally feel much safer around women so not everyone will weigh the same to that point as I do And of course personal experiences See the reason I said I realized I feel safer watching a stream is that I would feel like I would get a better glimpse into the person playing and by that find safety in knowing the person s motivations to the degree that is perceivable over it in the first place Commentary adds a lot to that  That being said it would be really great to see someone break through all this negativity Show them how it s done without toxic masculinity 
Feminism,1615500738,They aren t I had women get violent with me when I refuse them   Which is weird because women can get it somewhere else fairly easy I had several women force themselves on me and wouldn t take no for an answer My first time I was drunk and practically  passed out and the woman forced herself on me One diffrence with guys is we don t make a deal out of it since it doesn t effect us emotionally and its not painful but I mean I was way to out of it to consent and honestly didn t want to Technically it was rape I didn t realize that untill years later It doesn t bother me just kinda wish my first time wasn t with some rando from a bar and a nite I barely remember 
Feminism,1615500678,Not sure if you replied to the wrong comment but the show I was referring to is Call my Agent not Big Bang Theory I m kind of in the middle with BBT I thought it was hilarious when it came out but I definitely see that it s problematic and agree with the criticisms 
Feminism,1615500677,The actual existence of physical violence is the highest escalation provising the biggest impulse to intervene If someone is afraid to intervene someone grabbing a girl s ass because he might end in the hospital do you think he would be more willing to risk his physical wellbeing if the women  just got catcalled I don t think that s a fair argument on your end to make Also as I explained people may have different resources Sure if you can afford to help someone in distress you should     do it But for many people it may not be an option Is it lack of character that a     guy doesn t want to intervene catcalling from a group of drunk and possibly aggressive guys Wh should he be risking his physical health for a stranger Where does this obligation come from He can call the police and that s all you should expect from him Do you think otherwise And if so why is that If you would go to hospital or lose your job to help someone you maybe don t even know you are a better human than most people 
Feminism,1615500536,Ahah well full disclosure here When I was like    playing Guild Wars   my dad asked me why I was playing as a woman with a smug expression on his face That s pretty much what I answered him and had been answering since until some years ago when I got educated and educated myself further on feminism and started deconstructing dumb toxic shit Seems like we re going full circle On the other hand tho I m afraid they might have a point Maybe the experienced comfort is just gratification in misogynistic objectification and visual stimuli That s an hypothesis I m fairly afraid of I wouldn t like myself very much in that case 
Feminism,1615500504,Yeah maybe I just like being stereotypically feminine They are ultimately just social constructs 
Feminism,1615500426,I disagree I think most rapist just have zero self  control and want sex 
Feminism,1615500367,There is nothing wrong with teaching our young people risk mitigation strategies and situational awareness What  women have been objecting to is different  Women are given advice that a assumes we don t already know and practice these strategies and b asks us to go beyond these strategies in ways that unreasonably restricts our ability to participate in public life It is also advice that is not given to men  We should remember that many women  especially if they are poor can t avoid going out alone even if we wanted to or would have to make extraordinary sacrifices to do so  Let s also remember that given women are actually at higher risk from men known to them the commonly suggested strategy of  ask a male friend to walk you home is probably more dangerous than walking home alone 
Feminism,1615500336,If a guy wants to be more feminine in appearance thats fine if thats what you want

Feminism,1615499913,How do you actively end violence other than not participating or condoning it I don t see how society as a whole will end violence The world is violent in genera I even read a study that claimed the human body is designed for violence Violence is caused by so many factors its virtually impossible to end That would also mean ending mental illness and basic human nature in fact nature is violent even plants are violent We can preach don t hit women until our throats bleed but that won t stop every psychopath from doing it Furthermore violence can be circumstantial a perfectly nice guy and general may strike a woman in a blind rage or because he s drunk In the western world violence in general against anyone is shunned but it still happens and will probably always happen as sure as water is wet This same theory applies to  teach men not to rape Every man knows he shouldn t  rape no one needs to be taught that Things that you don t want done to you people know they shouldn t do to others But some people don t care 
Feminism,1615499720,It s alright I ll be playing too obvi the question still applies I should also add that I don t plan on talking or showing my face on stream but my gender and preferred pronouns will definitely be on the Twitch bio page  gt I generally avoid men playing as women because they tend to be creepy or exploitive often both  So it s more of a correlation than a causality relationship  Like no inherent problem with using a fem avatar as a cis male In this case and at the risk of saying something unsafe isn t it just that MMO culture is stifled with toxic masculinity and creepy dudes while most people are using fem avatars anyway  Or are men using masc avatars generally less toxic and safer  
Feminism,1615499665,Are you qualified to teach adult women how to protect themselves Do you not think we already know how The outrage over the Sarah Everard situation is that she did everything right She did all she could to protect herself and was still murdered It isn t that no women should do what they can to avoid danger it s that most women already do what they can and are still killed The issue is women have and are still being made to change what they do to accomodate for the actions of murderers and rapists Like when the yorkshire ripper was about and women were put under a curfew Would it not have made more sense to put men under a curfew since then any men out and about could be classed as suspects Obvious y it s not an identical situation but you get my point  Women do and will continue to do everything they can to protect themselves and nothing you say will change that Instead do us a favour and make sure other men in your life arent harrassing raping or murdering women 
Feminism,1615499582,It seems to me too impractical If we lived in some utopian society where discrimination or violence are are few and far between having an active position against every instances of marginalisation would be in everyone s physical or mental capacity but our world is far too cruel to allow that  Everyday we are passing through constant stream of news that never stop to report about injustices around the world Every case is deserving full public attention but not everyone has ability or time to provide it It is inevitable that there would be a need to prioritize some events over others and I don t know any other method to do so other than leaving it on our own personnel choice Nobody should decide for anyone what problems in society are more important  if you agree with all of that  you must also consider that there would be people who would who while not supporting current state of affairs still not do anything about it Edit misspelled
Feminism,1615499439,I wonder in which way you should expect men individually to step in on such occasions I hope we can have a meaningful discussion on this so let me elaborate Let me first start by the premise of abolishing toxic gender roles One of which would be the male as the strong protector of the weak female Women are strong and need no men to protect them So there is no obligation to stop violence because they are men On the other hand men might also face consequences if they intervene in certain violent situations These consequences may be social or physical Which highly depends on the social area the violence is happening For example A man has a job he needs for his survival He sees his boss molest one of his female colleagues And while the colleague is afraid to stop her boss because she might lose her job you could say the same about the man bearing witness to the horrible behavior A man in the Disco watching someone grab a women s butt This is obviously and clearly sexual violence While the women might be afraid to defend herself due to clear physical threat the man witnessing can feel the same way Intervention might lead to himself ending up in the hospital for someone he doesn t even know In conclusion in certain situation men might not have the resources to actively intervene a violent situation May it be financially socially or physically Expecting those men to risk their health financial stability or social standing in some cases for someone they don t know may be a lot to ask This said if you have the resources to intervene a case of violence you should obviously do it No matter the attacker or victim of this violence But I think it s important to have a bit of nuance here

Feminism,1615499171,My concern with this type of sentiment is that some people will judge your efforts not to be enough or not matching their efforts and therefore you fall in with the oppressor I ve learned it takes all kinds and different people have different strengths The writer may not be an eloquent public speaker The person who works behind the scenes may not be comfortable protesting in a crowd The person that trys to educate on an individual basis because they connect better that way may not have things posted on social media And the movement leader from a year ago may now be battling cancer and no longer has the energy to devote to a cause  If we can take our personal judgements out of the equation and instead open the door for all types of support we may see a larger group It also gives some people an opportunity to learn other ways of support

Feminism,1615498466, gt I know I ve went a little off topic so I hope it s still within this subreddit s scope but would you say that my neutrality has made me complicit in anti Asian racism and other social justice movements that I haven t engaged as much in Are you taking a position of neutrality on this issue though Is it your position that you don t have an opinion  you don t feel one way or the other about it  and if you were confronted by someone who did have a racist opinion about Asian s and COVID would you agree with them to avoid conflict What would your response be to someone impacted by the issue directly asking for your help Would you decline and say  I don t have an opinion and I prefer to be neutral  Because that s different than having an opinion but not having had an occasion to become involved in an effort for advocacy I think what s also okay and different  is prioritizing issues on the basis of your capacity to engage and be meaningfully knowledgeable and supportive  not everyone can be involved in every issue I have tended to prioritize feminism  because I m a woman and anti racism  because I m a white person living in a majority black city   other issues I am active in have a priority order after those two based on my limited human ability to think and feel and be fully present  and that kind of prioritization isn t what Jamil or others who use this kind of language is talking about Burning yourself out trying to give equal air time and attention to every group and issue in the world is impossible  no one involved in activism for the long haul has that expectation of themselves or others

Feminism,1615498317,I am a female physician working in the ER I think something we as physicians aren t always good at is reconciling patient priorities with our priorities I have a few things to recommend to patients to help reframe the  we are a team approach to their own symptoms Spoiler alert  the final step is to find a new GP if you still aren t feeling listened to  First off book an appointment to specifically address the symptoms that aren t being attended to Don t try to tag them onto an appointment about your other health issues The latter may result in you being blown off as time often limits most GP appointments to ten minutes If your GP is really focused on your heart health they may not have time to address say more chronic symptoms such as fatigue or pain or weight loss etc  Be upfront with specific concerns in that appointment don t leave them to the end Usually we open with an open question like  what brings you in today  Reply with something like  I was hoping to ask some questions related to my  lt symptom gt  as I feel as though I don t fully understand my management plan for it   If you have something in particular you are worried about be upfront about that too  Doctor I keep getting frightened that this pain may be cancer Is that something you are concerned about too or have we ruled that out already  If we haven t ruled that out  Would we be able to do some tests for that for peace of mind or can you explain to me why that isn t on your list of possibilities  The answer to  can I get more tests may still be  no depending on what your concern or question is For example if you are requesting full body MRI to rule out every possible cause of cancer that isn t a feasible workup But if you re having pelvic pain or bleeding  I saw in your comment the concern was the reproductive system  and wonder if there could be a problem there a pelvic ultrasound or endometrial biopsy is a reasonable and easy thing to arrange for  As someone else suggested if your management plan still seems like you re being blown off you have a few options First you can say something like  okay so the best step now is to give it some more time to see if it settles It has already been a problem for  lt days weeks months whatever gt  When should I come back in if it fails to settle down to go forward with the next step What is the next step  You can also ask for a referral  If it doesn t settle down would I be able to discuss this further with a specialist If there s a long waitlist could we put that referral in today so the follow up is in place  If all else fails  Would I be able to talk about this with one of the other Doctors in your practice to get a second opinion I m really worried about it  And finally you can  fire your doctor and call around for a new one if you re still being blown off  I don t recommend exaggerating your symptoms as someone else here commented If symptoms are exaggerated  so a chronic symptom is being stated as severe or more acute or in a larger distribution  it can change the differential diagnosis So you may end up with a work up that is inappropriate for your presenting complaint  Honesty is the best policy Sometimes it does take several visits and a step wise approach to get a diagnosis and this is normal and reasonable  Consider attending the appointment with your mom if she is having trouble explaining these things or isn t being listened to If all else fails find a new provider Attending medical school doesn t make us all good people or infallible and sometimes you just have a bad egg as a PCP

Feminism,1615545032, gt It seems like feminists can understand this concept when they tell men to do their own advocacy on men s issues instead of asking them to do it  Here s the thing though the majority of violent crimes are committed by men against both men and women It seems to me that part of the problem is that men often don t do anything to help each other either One of the main things that gets repeated over and over is that we need to teach boys how to properly handle their actions and emotions and take some personal responsibility rather than expecting other people to change their behavior This would not only help reduce violence against women but it would help reduce violence in general

Feminism,1615532563,I do think there are good points made here and many elements of modern culture that teach women and girls that they should be afraid to exist publicly in the world but tolerant of and obedient to authority figures and family members  are rooted in sexist traditions often with a splash of racism and victim blaming for good measure  That said I d be hesitaant come to the conclusion that it s  all an overblown phenomenon For instance there are plenty of ways women can be made to feel uniquely uncomfortable alone in public spaces that might fall short of actually constituting violent crime but still contribute to a general feeling of hostility or danger that can leave a lasting impression  Also not all crime is necessarily cut from the same cloth even if men are more likely than women to be the victims of violent crime in general women could still be more likely to be the victim of  gendered violence   that is crime committed not out of opportunism but specifically on the basis of the victim s sex with rape and sexual assault being some obvious examples That kind of disproportionality can  rightly make a person feel less safe even if the absolute numbers are still lower

Feminism,1615524156,Anarchist here I strongly oppose the idea of more women billionaires more women cops etc The existence of these groups is fundamentally oppressive in my worldview and I would not devote any time to making it happen As for public office   public office is a tool Electoralism is one theory of change and even many leftist projects ultimately appeal to elected officials on some level   for instance if they are using disruption to convince a public official to do the right thing on an issue the response to it will still depend on that official So I am not opposed to being thoughtful about electoral politics But I don t think that a woman politician is inherently more progressive than a man who is a politician If Sarah Palin and Bernie Sanders were both running for office I would neither shun Sanders because he is a man nor vote for Palin because she is a woman And from an anarchist perspective spending massive amounts of energy on something like I don t know infiltrating the DNC and implementing a bunch of policies making political office more accessible for women is not the most valuable use of time although I would support friends and comrades doing that work

Feminism,1615551710,Hey I think I edited while you were replying  I try not to overedit but it s earlier here and I m still a little groggy  This is what I added  gt ETA To be clear if someone is being sexist or otherwise oppressive against a woman billionaire or a woman cop I would object Like if someone says a woman cop should be sexually assaulted that s absolutely not okay and I d have words with them But that s very very different from pushing for more women cops or more women billionaires I also added this  gt  If there were sexist laws against it I might feel differently but like   I am never going to be part of the billionaire class and I will probably never even own a home Not only do I not have the  power to influence corporate culture at the level of the billionaire class not only is it completely foreign to me I m also fundamentally uninterested in supporting anyone in their goal to steal more food from people s mouths   amp  x   B  gt Not all people with STEM careers or in politics become billionaires anyways in fact most people don t So why shouldn t we push for women to be in STEM or other higher earning fields Oh perhaps this is the point of confusion I was explicitly  not talking about STEM or politicians here I was introducing a situation in which I would probably agree with OP s interlocutor as a way of explaining why I  don t agree on other things and articulating the places where I see more nuance  gt As for cops I m not educated enough on the topic to know why it s oppressive I don t live in US but I just thought you guys wanted to defund the police because of bigotry in the system but not the system itself I d say that what you ve described is the dominant view My feeling which is the dominant  anarchist perspective on this issue is that   the police and prison system is deeply and irredeemably tied to white supremacy  The thirteenth amendment to the US constitution which ostensibly abolished slavery reads  Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude    except as a punishment for crime   whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction     Even if policing and prisons weren t irredeemably racist they are oppressive systems in and of themselves

Feminism,1615550295,     It s a bit like a person living in an island in oceania and saying that they won t watch their local football league because the quality isn t as high as in the premier league It doesn t make sense   I disagree  that person has every right to watch the best football they can find or their local football or both or neither There is no right or wrong  Yeah I sounded a bit silly what I meant was that the commentators seemed to speak as if the only reason people would watch football is if it s high level enough It s like saying people would only want to watch fighting matches to see who would objective win and so only watch heavyweight and superheavyweight fights but  in reality we know that people are just as interested if not more interested in fights of lower weight classes including interest in women s fights All you need to do is not seperate out women or different weight classes  or different events An example I can give you is from Go In the west knowledge about Japanese professionals     I am strongly against having men s section and women s section in sports I think there should be just  Open section and  Women s section no need to exclude women to give them they re own space Are you scared that some women might win against too many men   I always used to be against that idea on the basis that it could be unfair on men who felt obliged to hold back a bit when up against women On reflection that is a very very poor reason   If anything I fear that the reverse is actually the problem  having an open football league and then having to explain that women can participate it s just that in the   years since the rule came in no woman has made the grade is unlikely to do much for women s sport Neither woudl it benefit women s sport if if was just like now only with the handful of superstars missing because they are playing in a non elite men s league Am I laying it on a bit think Maybe But what about  x   m relay Let s have a mixed team in the Olympics   women just aren t gonna make the cut And whilst football is about skill to a very large extent it is also all about physicality Take the english PL Excluding goalkeepers the players are pretty much all   to    with the vast majority of those between about   and    A   year old man who was  at his peak  one of the fittest and best players in the league has very little chance of being able to compete physically any more How is a     woman who runs      slower than a man gonna have a chance Their skill levels would have to be through the roof which is not realistic and may still not be enough When my team play  I ve just checked  we can put out a side which includes five tall players who can go forward to attack the ball from corners Those five players average     m or        ok so normally only four of them are playing but I ve just googled and Wendie Renard at     was the tallest player at the     world cup I m speculating here but I d guess that if you were to put together a women s team including all the tallest women s players who play international football they d risk losing to my favourite men s team simply on the basis of being out jumped at set pieces even if they matched my team in every other way It would be fascinating to see those women who could compete and at what level But I fear it would be an exception that proves the rule that women can t match the men physically rather than an inspiration to other women And this is nothing to feel bad about   a lightweight male boxer gets on with being the best at his size he doesn t worry that if he were in a bar fight with a heavyweight he d be dead in   seconds  I thought of the idea that in MMA that Women in the same weight class as men could fight with little problem if   On the day before the fight the woman would have to weigh in heavier  likely the man would try to weigh in near the bottom of the weight class while the woman would try to weigh in near the top of the weight class   Remove the illegality of some moves for the woman for example she can t use eye gouges but  can hit in the below the belt area and hit a floored opponent This may sound uncivillised but actually this is necessary so that the man doesn t take it easy on the woman If he felt his balls were at risk in a way hers weren t he wouldn t feel the need to go easy  amp  x   B I agree with you that  the Korean Wpmen s Baduk League gained  more coverage     than the male one which is the biggest baduk tournament in korea a country were  In the west we have more familiarity with the Korean baduk scene than the Chinese weiqi one even though

Feminism,1615547132,Virtually all of the assumptions behind this post are horrifically wrong Here s a breakdown  Unemployment benefits are a safety net and are given when you can t find employment in your branch In Germany for example they are paired with actively helping you find employment in your branch If I lose my job nobody is going to withhold my unemployment insurance  that I pay for out of my income because I don t want to be a coal miner let alone a sex worker  which is legal here  You are assuming that only women can be  expected to be sex workers under this model Sex work is work for everyone who wants to do it  Consent cannot be commoditised and in fact sex work is not a commodity It s not oil or gold you re not selling pussy futures on the NYSE It s a service that you offer     or more and can refuse to offer Just like any other professional doesn t sell  hours and get called up and forced to do those hours to whoever buys them I can refuse to work for oil companies  and I do  so can sex workers  in a context where they are treated like professionals and not a commodity refuse to work with a client they don t like of feel safe with Of course sex work and sexual exploitation are not the same thing A person willfully engaging in prostitution or any other form of sex work is a professional providing a service A person forced into sex work is in fact being commoditised objectified so I could imagine this is closer to what you mean by commoditising consent  it s not because there s no consent in such a scenario  Part of the problem of treating sex work as its own special thing  rather than work is that it opens many doors for exploitation I have the right as a professional to deny service to a company I dislike because I have legal protections from basic forms of workplace lock in that many sex workers do not This is also the case for most trafficked workers in e g sweatshops I would not engage in or consume sex work because it s not up my alley But it someone wants to fuck for a living they should have the same rights I do Period 
Feminism,1615546712,The idea behind this is that there are multiple issues that can be focused on at once More women going into fields that were typically associated with men get them more representation in that field because they re harder to talk over That being said if there are more women in certain fields there is a broader horizon we can use to talk about platforms that might otherwise be overlooked

Feminism,1615545484,It sounds like you re asking if women could do sex work legally if they should be denied unemployment benefits I think the focus should perhaps be on getting sex workers to the point where if they re trafficked they aren t charged for a crime Maybe getting them some rights should be the way to go there And if it was legal that s an extremely explicit job No one should be forced to take a job they aren t willing to take 
Feminism,1615563742,Right but that s different than what the two of you were arguing about before no  I guess that s what I m misunderstanding about your prior discussion As OP directly called out that scenario where one should get involved if you see it happening  But inactivity by  not forwarding posts on social media would you consider that as condoning male violence

Feminism,1615563684,To me I think the important thing is to just keep in mind the way discussing the beauty of women encourages men to act and makes women feel Like imagine you gave an hour long talk about a subject you re very knowledgeable in posted it online and every single comment was from someone saying you were really hot you were really ugly or that they liked your shirt or something  No one had anything to say about Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Networks or whatever you presented  They just wanted to talk about your body  Imagine that someone bigger than you and scarrier told you you were beautiful and then tried to follow you home Imagine how that might make you feel in other situations when others discussed your physical appearance And with that understanding in mind think about how you discuss women s bodies  So like  Wow I love polevaulting the athletes are so graceful is a thing you could say that is unlikely to devalue anybody but saying it about a specific female athlete might be a situation where you d want to be careful to not make her uncomfortable or encourage others to talk about her body

Feminism,1615563417,It s a derogatory term used first by Rush Limbaugh to describe feminists in general which is now often found in anti feminist circles to further the idea that feminists are dangerous irrational and militant People who use this term believe feminist critiques of society are akin to fascism and that feminists are seeking an oppressive regime that is anti man and anti free speech In this regime females strip males of their rights outlaw masculinity and use sex as a tool to enslave men People also just use it to describe feminists who aren t nice enough to them

Feminism,1615561046,So this is kind of a complicated question  The behavior you re describing isn t what I d call  male gaze   Male gaze means that a piece of media was produced presenting women in a way to cater to male sexuality The term I d give to your behavior is  sexualization   A woman was going about her day answering a question about her religion  She wasn t doing a makeup tutorial or showing off a new outfit or something else to indicate that she was soliciting your opinion on her physical appearance  You didn t have anything to say about what her opinion was you had to make it about how she looks and whether you do or don t find her attractive  And yeah that kind of attitude can be a  result of male gaze in the media  When you re raised with imagery that makes you feel like female bodies exist for your view it can result in men reducing women to their appearance and that s bad because it means that women are reduced to their bodies  Beautiful women are treated as if their only value is in their bodies and ugly women are treated as if they have no value whatsoever So what you do about it is absolutely you keep it to yourself about how attractive or unattractive you think a stranger is unless they re asking for your opinion  And when you create media you don t portray any person specifically for the sexual satisfaction of the audience unless you re producing literal pornography  Media should be about telling the story of the characters you re presenting or communicating the ideas you re trying to communicate 
Feminism,1615561042,Your friend is incorrect male gaze is an academic term that refers to film and media first and foremost What you did might be objectification  And as for  what s wrong with it  from a feminist perspective you already got a reply  reinforces the idea of women being sexual objects But it s also wrong from artistic perspective if it doesn t add anything to the story or character and especially if it contradicts story or character Example of it done correctly when it could easily be ruined in hands of       directors Mad Max Fury Road When Max first sees the wives cleaning themselves most male directors would film it as  Angelina Jolie in a shower  type of thing You know what I m talking about Instead he filmed it in a way that makes sense  Max lusts for water not women Women are framed neutrally in wide and medium shots without camera lingering on their attractive bodies  Example where it s done poorly  almost every fucking movie Basically you can film ass and tits but only if it makes sense And it doesn t makes sense in most cases I love showing recent Netflix anthology  Love Death and Robots  as an example Two shorts  Witness and Aquila Rift  has a lot of nudity But one is done with purpose and dare I say taste adding to the tone and story and the other is done because writer and director are talentless hacks who think naked women  good visual storytelling  If you compare the two shorts you ll notice that despite clear time and effort put into both one is good at all levels not just usage of nudity and another is bad at all levels  writing directing even character design  Basically male gaze is just bad writing in almost all cases 
Feminism,1615560998,Well then such requirements don t exist to the best of both of our knowledge So the original question stands for all persons that would be capable to do such work 
Feminism,1615560736,For bars gyms clubs etc this is awesome Whether or not it s exclusive to trans ppl depends on the venue and if they decide to discriminate I don t think a man can pass as a trans woman or at least take the effort to effectively do so LGBT ppl and POC should get their own too at some places It s nice to be among community and know you won t be harassed I don t think it needs to be everywhere but as a queer woman the idea of only being around other women or LGBT ppl sounds amazing
Feminism,1615560727,You do need at least some skills for sex work If you re just doing extremely low rent prostitution  like streetwalking maybe not as much but if you are going to be a cam girl or a pole dancer or an exotic dancer or do sensual massage or whatever that definitely requires skills equipment and physical ability And even if you were just streetwalking that gig comes with enormous risk to your physical safety So you can t really just brush that off 
Feminism,1615560688,Are these requirements clarified anywhere at least in places that it is legal

Feminism,1615560534,Maybe I m misunderstanding but I thought this post wasn t calling about inaction  like what happened in your experience but rather not out searching for trouble  Like if I saw something I could stop I would but I m also not patrolling streets or flying to Afghanistan Rambo Taken style to disrupt a sex trafficking ring  I believe OP was trying to make that distinction outside of  direct involvement

Feminism,1615560165,Forcing you to go work in a machine shop when you have no experience or knowledge of how to do so would be incredibly dangerous just because you physically would be able to do a job doesn t mean you have the skills to do it and they re not going to hire you anyway because you don t know what you re doing and could get yourself or somebody else killed The fact that you could  potentially work heavy machinery doesn t translate to actual practical knowledge about how to do so Sex work is similar It requires a particular skill set that yes you  could acquire but which you don t currently have and therefore would not be effective at that job anyway 
Feminism,1615560159, gt there s just a lot of practical concerns here that can t be boiled down to  well if sex work is work why shouldn t everyone have to do it if they can  We are looking at the same date and I am not sure why you would conclude we should  still call it as just another form of work  despite all these practical concerns Surely all these practical concerns prove in fact that it is  not just another form of work

Feminism,1615559951,That s mainly a business decision Gyms realised that many women don t feel safe or comfortable to train with men so they don t come It s marketing to gain customers  Men don t seem to feel uncomfortable with women so they would work out one way or another I don t see why gyms would make men only hours when there s little demand for that I personally got to a women only gym for different reasons but no men being there was a factor I don t want my ass and face being judged when I m doing sport I can t avoid it on a daily basis but if there are spaces where I can I ll gladly take the opportunity 
Feminism,1615559939,I especially don t like the way she thinks of being out at night as something you can just stop being terrified of That terror is ingrained pretty deep into my mind as my parents were very strict about that and I lived in a nasty bit of California for a while where all my fears were reinforced  I didn t get raped or mugged or anything but I did see someone get beaten up on the streets and I watched a car blow up At this point it s just an irrational terror which I will probably never get over
Feminism,1615559913,I don t know how to explain to you that you re not going to be denied unemployment for not applying for and accepting a job that is not within your current ability in terms of skill  Like what do you think sex work actually is Again nothing about unemployment implies that you need to apply for and accept absolutely any job

Feminism,1615559841,I feel like she has good points and this is a really complicated topic that a thoughtful feminist could come down on either side of I went to a university that as one of its core tenets is integrated with the neighborhood it s built in  Other schools in my city are in  nicer areas of town and even then are built with these huge walled off campuses and green manicured lawns  My school isn t  The dorms and student buildings are built on residential streets in a low income area of town that s rapidly gentrifying with the student population there  It wasn t unusual to see neighborhood people at college events or just using the green as a park to play with their kids  Students from the neighborhood with the grades can go there for free And there was this weird attitude you d often encounter in the students there  They d joke frequently about the dangerousness of the neighborhood  Just really mean stuff calling specific streets names based on rape jokes and jokes about the murder of sex workers  It was an attitude that student groups and campus organizations fought against tooth and nail but they d also be really really loud about the message of  don t go out alone at night use this campus van to drive to take you to the grocery store  But also it was incredibly incredibly dangerous to go out on campus after dark  I had  close and personal friends get robbed at gunpoint  One year a female student got kidnapped and forced into a van and she kicked the shit out of her captors until they dropped her off  streets away  I luckily never was mugged  I never went anywhere alone after dark  but my car was broken into  times in  years and stolen once  It was completely appropriate to be cautious walking around campus at night  Completely appropriate But it wasn t that the surrounding neighborhood was full of shitty people  We were a bunch of fucking rich college kids in a low income area  Anybody who had it in their minds to mug somebody we were extremely easy targets  After I graduated I lived a couple streets down for the next  or  years  It was mostly families immigrants and people of color and every time it snowed we would all go out together and shovel all the driveways and the sidewalks and any time a car got stuck on the road we would all run over and push it out  Once I left the lights on in my car and my neighbor who spoke no English knocked on my door gestured me over and pointed it out to me  I have never had such kind and friendly neighbors  amp  x   B It s possible for attitudes about safety and danger to be both harmful and justified  You can be unfairly demonizing a whole neighborhood of people because of racism and instilling fear as a means of control in women and also be correct about the level of danger that people are in I don t know the right way to combat that  I think it s a difficult line to walk  I think that it s important to look at actual data to determine how dangerous something  actually is before you tell someone to change her behavior to avoid it  And to be careful of the way you talk about whole communities of people based on the crimes of a few committed there  It is a very hard line to walk but it s one that should be walked with compassion 
Feminism,1615559814,Sex work is both illegal and dangerous It would also be ridiculous to ask for example married people to engage in sex work and violate their marriage vows or risk not receiving unemployment benefits People should never be forced into doing sex work Having to resort to prostitution if you lose your job is the very definition of survival sex Also what if you re a terrible prostitute What if nobody wants you to use your services Then what You know there s just a lot of practical concerns here that can t be boiled down to  well if sex work is work why shouldn t everyone have to do it if they can

Feminism,1615574651,I don t understand why asking this question is treated with hostility Can anyone explain 
Feminism,1615574585,What can also often pass as sly hostility under the guise of criticality is trying to  quiz people about specifically controversial figures because you are seeking a particular outcome from the conversation  ie you already have your opinion about this person but want that to be either validated or invalidated by others in this forum for your own reasons I don t take particularly kindly to people who do that because I think it s disingenuous and not really in the spirit of camaraderie  in asking you to provide context about a person who has subsequently been proven to be controversially feminist  I m helping other readers both learn to investigate new subjects or speakers and better evaluate information and claims for themselves I think that s a useful contribution even if I am not personally an expert or authority on this particular person or their body of work The fact that it has resulted in a hostile response from you suggests to me anyway that my instinct towards criticality is being appropriately applied 
Feminism,1615574530,The only  stereotype I am  promoting is the fact that men are more dangerous to women than the reverse and that fact is what explains the generalised difference that the OP asked about Of course it s not true of every man

Feminism,1615574363,I would refrain from making generalizations on men being ok with cat calling and sexual assault It promotes harmful stereotypes of men always wanting sex and being ok with physical boundaries being pushed  Even when you re not in physical danger you can be violated and those feelings are valid regardless of gender And physical force is not the only dynamic at play in every situation also could you explain what you mean by  biology 
Feminism,1615574263,Yes women and their sexuality generally aren t perceived as aggressive and threatening A woman s sexuality is considered dishonourable to herself at worst 
Feminism,1615574191,Thank you  I have since also reviewed her wiki and came to much the same conclusions especially re that line about Hoff Sommers This is what ultimately makes me feel that OP s general ask about feminists feelings on her is more than a little leading and perhaps even a bit disingenuous  I personally don t count folks who self identify as libertarian as particularly effective feminists and the deeper one goes into examining her body of work and her beliefs  the more dubious it is that she is in fact representative of modern feminism in anything but name 
Feminism,1615573704,Oh I never thought of this and I agree I think the    novelty of it for the lack of a better term is a big part of the appeal I also came across a tweet that said men would actually welcome being inappropriately flirted to in gaming communities because they lack attention and affection overall which had like a few thousand or so likes I think it s a similar case If you re really  literally thirsty even seawater will taste satiating 
Feminism,1615573460,In that situation Muslims have reason to fear pervasive discrimination and violence because some people do actually believe they are all extremists that to me is the biggest difference 
Feminism,1615573447,Dick pics are a latent threat There s no threat presented by receiving a picture of a vulva It s why men on the whole respond positively also to women cat calling or touching them in public What s she going to do attack him with her vulva Sure some women are violent blah blah blah but on aggregate the threat presented to men by women is so low it s nearly zero The threat presented to women by men is much higher So i believe it is in a way to do with  biology but absolutely not because men  have higher sex drives or  are socialised to  Men can rape and kill us much more easily than we can do any harm to them Of course we respond differently 
Feminism,1615573397,Of course But that is not the premise in your original question  AOC is my people but some  girlboss CEO enriching herself at the expense of her exploited workers and society at large is not empowering This is not something I would aspire to as as woman We don t need more billionaires not even black lesbian disabled ones I would rather have an old white dude with progressive policies that shares the profits of the company with its workers 
Feminism,1615573359,Men aren t bombarded with vagina pics or unwanted advances      frankly with any advances but that s a different topic  This likely has to do with their perception of these occurrences when they do happen

Feminism,1615572892,Amazing I wish there were women only cars on subway trains especially 
Feminism,1615572878,I agree that many people use NotAllMen in bad faith to derail conversation If someone post     said NotAllMuslims would that be considered derailing the conversation on the threat of religious extremism in the Middle East

Feminism,1615572728,Just so ya know the reason there aren t men only gyms is because there isn t enough of a demand for them There s just no money to be made in men only gyms
Feminism,1615572643, gt No because cis men don t experience violence or harassment in gym settings related to their gender identity I d put a caveat on that one While it s not really relevant in the context of a gym I think it s fair to have specific time slots at venues for specific groups in other settings Everyone needs a safe space sometimes  It can be harder for men to open up about certain issues in a mixed setting for example than in a group that they know consists mostly of other men who are dealing with the same issues 
Feminism,1615572409,I m fine with it depending on the context A store that is  Whites Only all the time has a different connotation than  Women s Hour Tuesday    PM or  Weekly Bisexual support group   amp  x   B  gt Do you think this is exclusionary to trans people I don t think that women only is exclusionary to trans people Trans women are women and should be allowed in those spaces Anyone trying to keep trans women out isn t doing it because of a women only space they re doing because they re opposed to trans people to begin with  gt Should men also get an hour    gt    gt Should other groups e g races LGBT etc also get their own time slots Sure why not I know a few spaces in my city that have men s only hours that either host support groups for men open a safe space for men to discuss issues they think are specific to them or just give a space for gay men to mingle without dealing with drunk sorority girls They re also welcoming of trans men I don t have a problem with time slots as long as they re just that Specific times slots that can be dedicated to specific groups or topics while the business is open to everyone at all other times 
Feminism,1615572048,Yeahhh like i watch far too much true crime so even though i myself havent had many experiences where ive been in danger i remember all the murdered women and girls i read about everytime i go out  at night I can t just flip a switch and forget those stories and just stop being nervous And it is defo verging on irrational but if that irrationality saves my life at some point then im not complaining haha 
Feminism,1615571856,If it s a private venue it seems ok   gt Is it exclusionary to trans people  If trans women are allowed during this hour no If trans women aren t allowed during this hour yes   gt Should men also get an hour Do men want an hour If so they could speak to management and if there s enough demand they could get their special hour  gt Should other groups e g races LGBT etc also get their own time slots Probably not But it would depend on the kind of venue It would also probably be good for it to be optional 
Feminism,1615571705,I am a WOC and while I would like more political representation from WOC for their diverse perspectives I am not going to pretend that having a woman in a position of power does anything for equality unless she is interested in uplifting others and dismantling systems of oppression Too often female politicians are simply there to maintain the status quo while providing better optics No thanks 
Feminism,1615571673,Yes I know But in the second wave there were people pushing the idea that femininity not only hegemonic femininity  was inherently inherently patriarchal and that the only reason a woman would want to be feminine is because she was brainwashed by patriarchy A lot like the idea that political lesbians held that the only reason that they were straight  women was because of patriarchal influence And I didn t said that the idea that femininity is bad did originate with feminists but there were feminists who  have equated femininty with being weak and conforming to the standards men set for women  
Feminism,1615571636,One thing that I ve seen happen a lot is people who do not take a side and try to stay neutral actively look the other way when things are happening or even deny it happens I think that s a horrible thing to do and only helps the patriarchy abusers and yes makes them on the side of allowing it to happen By looking the other way you are actively helping the other side However there is a spectrum between that  or worse and actively being on our side and not all positions are equally bad 
Feminism,1615571600,Right Like have they considered that all the precautions we take is one of the  reasons we re attacked at a lower rate And also that physical violence isn t the only thing to be wary of    of women in the uk have been sexually harrassed most people i know have had instances of being followed home or approached by random men or have had abuse yelled at them from across the street So to say that the streets arent dangerous is incredibly misinformed because although i dont know anyone who s been murdered almost every woman i know has been in a dangerous situation that could have escalated if not for the precautions they took at the time 
Feminism,1615571388,Yeah You could say she s gone astray in philosophical indulgence On the matter of child sexuality it sort of beckons back to this       French petition against age of consent laws

Feminism,1615571091,You can tell a lot by who supports her conservatives reactionaries like Jordan Peterson Not mainstream feminists unless you mean  feminists like fellow conservative Christina Hoff Summers  Something I didn t realize until looking her up just now she is also pro pedophilia  WTF  gt Camille Paglia has for almost three decades unrepentantly advocated for the legalization of sexual contact between adults and children of  any age  as well as the legalization of child pornography She is a pro pedophilia advocate who has repeatedly given her support to NAMBLA  the North American Man Boy Love Association  and has gone on record numerous times to state that she thinks  kiddie porn should be legalized  gt In Paglia s mind children are being harmed not by sexual contact with adults but by society s stigma surrounding pedophilia  gt  gt The damage from many pedophiliac encounters probably comes as some psychologists suggest less from the contact itself than from the culturally enforced stress and secrecy surrounding it   gt She also explained that the way to put an end to under age sex tourism in third world countries was to replace Christian morality in the West with  a more liberal pagan one that would allow for adults to freely court children for sex in our own societies In her mind the  sexual borderline between adults and children is an artificial construct that society would benefit from deconstructing  Lolita melts the sexual borderline that society has artificially drawn between child and adult    Well learning this definitely ruined my morning 
Feminism,1615571024,I have no  very specific opinion regarding her May I ask how you deduced that I m quite new to her writing myself I ve come here to get engage in some insightful discussion and bounce ideas If you haven t any knowledge of her obviously such a question would seem generalist   for those who know her will understand how such an open ended question fits here and lends itself to telling opinions It suffices to ignore the post if you haven t any useful contribution to make Sly hostility under the guise of criticality isn t the slightest bit noble 
Feminism,1615570975,The one good thing to the term was that it was from my experience an acceptance of masculinity in girls Notably there isn t an equivalent for feminine boys seen as the worse  I actually like thinking of my little self as tomboy it was a point of pride not negativity what was negative was the attitude I then took towards feminine girls and the color pink I think it did help me notice gender issues more as I didn t understand why I was treated so differently then boys despite thinking we were one in the same in our hobbies and such I also believe I may have higher levels of testosterone then most women and maybe that plays a small part in girls masculinity  or what society perceives as masculine behavior hobbies 
Feminism,1615570596,something to consider that i havent seen anyone bring up yet womens only hours at gyms are also good for women who wear hijab or other religious garb Many of them are able to take off their hijab headscarf in front of other women but not in front of men It can be difficult hot to work out in hijab so being able to take it off for an hour at the gym is a nice thing for them 
Feminism,1615570377,I haven t actually read any of her books This post is very likely the first I heard of her  I looked up her wiki and she doesn t even have a  controversies section  thus why I asked for more context I think it s rather peculiar to already have a very specific opinion about someone  but not share it and then come ask an extremely general question about the person 
Feminism,1615570249,There always seems to be men at my gym pool just hanging around in the pool and not swimming it is really uncomfortable The men also hog the jacuzzi and steam rooms and I can t go in there as the only women when  or  middle age dudes are taking up all the space Would love a women s hour   
Feminism,1615570106,The issue is what time would work It would be difficult to pick a time that everyone who wants to make it to those hours wouldn t be able to Likewise someone excluded from those hours might already have a relationship with the gym where they were working out at a specific hour that worked for them based on their schedule and they may now get kicked out of the gym for that time if that ends up being the women s only hour that the gym chooses That would present some pretty serious legal issues So it s kind of hard to establish women only hours at pre established gyms where you might have to dislocate people who were already there at that hour and can t work out at a different time I really only see it working for a business that is just starting and having it pre set from the beginning so members know exactly when they are allowed when they first sign up Another option is to build women designated rooms as extensions to gyms But the issue with that is if there will be enough women that would justify spending money adding an extension to the building 
Feminism,1615570078,I lived in a neighborhood where some gyms had women only classes to accommodate a religious group that was a big part of the neighborhood where the women wouldn t be able to work out with men within the rules of that religion I felt conflicted about it because I disagreed with those rules but was happy that these women had access to that space and time where otherwise they wouldn t  Also lived in a neighborhood where a bar geared toward college students had a women only hour where beer was   for that hour Then once the women were drunk they d let in the men That s for sure bad and scary

Feminism,1615567970,Sure That s a good point But as for the messaging and the lag inherent somethings missing where progress is either stopped by not being up to date or as I ve asked hindered by messaging ill suited to younger people University drop out rate may be a huge factor I m a drop out Between both sexes law school has a high failure rate and the main reason I see people pick law is that coming out of high school as it is now  standard to try pursue higher education those that see law as the best fit to their personality may be more in line with excelling in environments more focused on wholistic goals By that I mean law school is hell and usually only the most studious competitive and some mix of self esteem and narcissism really excel Giving messaging about breaking the glass ceiling might lead more socially minded people to pick the wrong profession Or perhaps more likely law school is fine law is fine law school might not need and revision or aid and that the fact that the post graduate opportunities are controlled by people      years older than law school graduates might mean that any changes to law school would unjustly push for for things that time is already set to fix I e when the generations shift the problem may reveal it self to be already solved So what s the harm in pushing people to a field like that Well beyond balance it s a costly road mentally and financially

Feminism,1615567490,Our snowboard places have  Women s only night in the terrain parks and it s honestly great It s a sport so dominated by showoff territorial dudes that women are intimidated to go into the park and work on skills There are several terrain parks around so the guys don t get shut out completely so no one complains about it I ve mastered a lot of tricks that I would never have dared attempt on a  normal night with guys judging me and pushing me to get out of the way And I ve made a lot of friends with women I might otherwise not have met or been intimidated by because of their skill level   I d imagine trans women would be welcomed as well I don t have any firsthand knowledge about it but it s a safe space

Feminism,1615580060,Please respect our  top level comment rule   which requires that all direct replies to posted questions must come from feminists and reflect a feminist perspective Non feminists may participate in nested comments only Comment you won t get another warning 
Feminism,1615580038, gt When men try to open up their own gyms they get labelled as misogynists and get vandalized protested There are a lot of gyms that are functionally men only the ones that were around ended up getting shut down because no one was using them IIRC
Feminism,1615579823,Thank you for your answer Re unacceptable questions There s a bit in the sidebar that feminism supporting questions should be in r Feminism but questioning or criticising feminism should be here It s really that that caused me to ask in the first place I infer  safe place for difficult questions from that  The thread that had me wondering is somewhere else in r AskFeminists and I don t know about cross linking I couldn t see anything about it that caused people to dislike some other OP s question and when I asked I just got shut down so I came here I agree it s very hypothetical without that context I guess I ll never know 
Feminism,1615579822,Wow I remember curves from when I was a kid I didn t realize that was an all women s gym I will look into it Thank you 
Feminism,1615579684,It s not that they re not  acceptable  If they weren t  acceptable  I would remove them  gt I am asking a question in ask feminists The question is  why don t you like some questions   Some questions is very vague Why don t you like some foods Why don t you like some people Why don t you like some colors 
Feminism,1615579667,Not true Plenty men feel uncomfortable working out around women  but making a  men only buisiness hour is financial suicide as many of our  outspoken radical feminist sisters think this is a sign of misogyny and treat it as such I m cool with exclusionary buisness hours but it really only goes one way and it s in the favour of women almost all the time Saying  I feel like this when I work out so I need a gender exclusive gym hour can go both ways The difference is no one cares about it when it s men who bring up the issue When men try to open up their own gyms they get labelled as misogynists and get vandalized protested This happened in my home town of White Rock BC in      Do you really think men can t be self conscious or ashamed of their body or feel uncomfortable working out in front of attractive athletic women Imagine your a guy who is overweight and self conscious and you go to your local gym and all the women in there are in excellent shape Instagram model levels of fitness  You don t think men ever go through that scenario Really  I don t understand why so many fellow feminists think being a man is some golden lottery ticket to an easy go lucky life where there is no emotional turmoil Just because men don t express themselves openly due to being ridiculed for expressing emotion by men and women doesn t mean that these things don t effect them I m sure if you asked around many guys especially the ones who are a little more out of shape would be a lot more comfortable working out in male only gyms 
Feminism,1615579361,As I told you before I m not complaining and it s not about points I m asking about why some questions are acceptable I also said very clearly that it s not about what I feel should be downvoted or upvoted Would you mind not patronising me and projecting an issue about my feelings into this conversation Really it s incredibly rude  I am asking a question in ask feminists The question is  why don t you like some questions  
Feminism,1615579252,There s a good bit of  this at play     There s the sexist notion that the man should drive so a woman driving bad is clearly because she s a woman 
Feminism,1615579241, gt You wanna play games call Milton Bradley just wanted to butt in and say I think you re a great mod
Feminism,1615579141,wow that s fucked up I ve heard the bullshit  you need two hands to clap adage as well  I do hope that prevailing generations can make a change on this absolute bullshit 
Feminism,1615579078,Understandably so I just didn t know where it was coming from 
Feminism,1615578975,Because complaining that other people who none of us are responsible for are downvoting posts you don t think should be downvoted is an annoying thing to do 
Feminism,1615578928,   or write run on sentences  Seriously though I urge you to resist the temptation to think of men s violence against women as something that only  or primarily happens at the hands of  the psyco in central park at  am    Most women who are raped know their attacker    That means it s a much deeper problem than a few  psycos  as comforting as it might be for us  non psycos to think in such simplistic terms  The unfortunate  and horrifying truth is that  every man is capable of committing such violence and we must start by acknowledging that capacity in ourselves and resisting it with everything we have Then we can work on the guys around us  Anything less is an insult to the women we love  and  by the way should be insulting to ourselves as guys since it suggests that we re incapable of rising above such horrible behavior and selfish ignorance And finally You can ditch the absurd  in the west thing because it is also beneath you as a human being There s no difference in the morality of men in the  west compared to the  east  whatever those terms are supposed to represent in your comment Men all over the planet have a problem with patriarchal thinking and violent assumptions We need to attack it around the world including here at home 
Feminism,1615578830,That must be where the mountain hogging dudes go when the snow melts  D
Feminism,1615578542,I understand the rhetorical reason for the proposed curfew but just to think of the notion a bit deeper what do you mean by men Are binary trans men included nonbinary masc presenting queer men in general Men with disabilities  who do we exclude when we say  men  
Feminism,1615578400,This is a small subreddit even comments that get a bunch of downvotes still get responses I literally can t answer why some questions get downvoted I don t know why other people do what they do Neither does anyone else 
Feminism,1615578363,Wait the lady in this article is sexually harassing random men that s so fucked      
Feminism,1615578148,That s literally how reddit works Upvotes move comments up and downvotes move comments down  suppress It s nothing about what I feel like should be upvoted or downvoted I m asking why some questions are downvoted I don t understand why you keep responding if you don t want to consider the question The only dramatic and patronising tone and language has been from you 
Feminism,1615577930,This isn t actually difficult I asked you if you think women can rape men You babbled on about the legal definition and pretended you didn t understand what I was asking you You wanna play games call Milton Bradley 
Feminism,1615577915,well if there wasn t a negative connotation to the term  sexual in this context then women wouldn t be afraid to work out amongst other men right predatory is exactly what women are afraid of when    of rapists are men and not women it s understandable that  predatory wouldn t seem like the right term from a man s point of view but you have to see it from the opposite gender s perspective 
Feminism,1615577879,Thanks for the nasty tone It s not about the points it s about silencing the question Downvotes move comments out of visibility So why are some questions suppressed and not answered I m not complaining I m asking you a question   in a sub called ask feminists 
Feminism,1615577872,Ok but I don t understand the question Are you asking if I believe the definition is moral 
Feminism,1615577751,Dude it s fucking downvotes It s fake internet points who gives a shit
Feminism,1615577655,Advising someone to stay in and instituting a curfew are not comparable Which isn t to suggest that the people saying that women should stay indoors are justified but it s not the same thing 
Feminism,1615577604,Generally when this is proposed it s meant to illustrate the ridiculousness of people telling women to just stay inside or not go out after dark to avoid being the victims of violent crime 
Feminism,1615577594,My original statement was  in UK law only penetration with a penis is rape     is that the bit you take issue with 
Feminism,1615577550,What do you mean It is the actual legal definition I am using the word as it is defined 
Feminism,1615577540,So by that logic thinking masculinity is bad as a man is a sign of internalized misandry I m just playing devils advocate here but I see a lot of generalizations made that if done the other way would be taken as very misogynistic 
Feminism,1615577470,I didn t ask you for the legal definition I asked YOU for what YOU are saying Do you think this  legal definition is accurate and correct 
Feminism,1615577417,I m not a fan of the  predatory term but I understand you are talking about being sexualized If this helps women getting comfortable it is good then 
Feminism,1615577415,I ve seen women respond to dick picks with strap on pics or pics of other men s dicks though as a way of responding to a threatening message with a threat of their own  It does seem like  receiving penetrative sex is perceived as threatening in a way that non penetrative sex or  giving penetrative sex just isn t  There are various kinds of rape and sexual assault but penetrative rape seems to cause more visceral fear  and it s often treated differently under the law  
Feminism,1615577327,Can you provide a citation that suggests that the curfew was proposed in earnest good faith and not as a rhetorical device 
Feminism,1615577314,Is it possible you ve missed the point here The suggestion was intended to make you outraged and then think about how outrageous it is that we expect women to stay in after dark lest they be raped and or murdered 
Feminism,1615577260, gt And I didn t said that the idea that femininity is bad did originate with feminists  the person i responded to did so this kind of is entirely beside the point of my comment s context
Feminism,1615577244,The statement was made for the exact purpose that it was made for highlight that when men are told to stay inside a huge fuss is created over this while it is normalized to say to female femme victims to just stay inside 
Feminism,1615577225,It is not my  stance  It is the legal definition of rape in the United Kingdom Rape is penetration by the penis of mouth anus or vagina Penetration of the body by anything other than a penis is legally  sexual assault by penetration  See here  
Feminism,1615577180,I mean obviously not but when this is  proposed it s directly in response to women being told they shouldn t go out for their own safety from   men So yes if the choice is between women having a curfew to keep us safe and men having a curfew my vote is for a curfew on men 
Feminism,1615577156,We get a lot of people posting gotcha s here Like   hourly  Sorry that offends you but my skepticism is warranted by experience 
Feminism,1615577020,If your stance is that women cannot rape men you are not welcome to make top level comments here Please clarify this statement immediately 
Feminism,1615576840,That would be quite the infringement on their civil rights don t you think 
Feminism,1615576789,In UK law only penetration with a penis is rape Females can sexually assault but not commit rape 
Feminism,1615576695,Curves was a big one back in the day  are they still around 
Feminism,1615576595,I cannot answer that for you This is Reddit and people often prefer to vote rather than participate But nobody is being  hostile  
Feminism,1615576532,Both that question and my question are downvoted and quite quickly I thought the point of the sub was to ask the difficult questions which wouldn t be acceptable elsewhere So why are these questions downvoted 
Feminism,1615576386,I posted a similar question once but about the traits we found attractive If we can agree that these preferences are caused or at least influenced by patriarchy should we strive to  fix and eradicate them  However at the same time choice is still a non negotiable tenet of feminism And your choice is your choice alone I think there s no clear cut answer whether it s simply your preferences or you were  brainwashed by the patriarchy into having these likes  and dislikes  You can really apply this logic to a lot of things such as liking makeup or wanting to be a stay at home mom  But it is important to at least examine where these preferences come from Maybe it IS caused influenced by patriarchy but the question is whether you should get rid of it or not As basic and cliche of an answer it is I think as long as you re still genuinely happy with your decisions you re not hurting or forcing anyone to align with your preferences and fully support the reversal of these roles then you re okay 
Feminism,1615576291,I ve never felt weird at a gym with men so for me personally it doesn t feel necessary but I have heard about creeps so maybe my experience isn t everyone else s
Feminism,1615576283,Not in a predatory way  But I haven t experienced any judgement in my gym in over  years yet Most aren t in the position to judge anyway  D It s not an Instagram gym Just women in old ugly clothes doing stuff 
Feminism,1615576070,I can t because I don t know what you re using to browse Reddit There is a search bar usually somewhere in the upper right hand corner 
Feminism,1615576050,And even then you don t need a penis to penetrate someone s body 
Feminism,1615575966,I m sorry but could you explain to me where I go to do this I m not that familiar with the whole side bar thingy

Feminism,1615575904,He was absolutely a father figure even if he wasn t technically her father He admits to being at Mia s place from very early morning until the kids went to sleep almost everyday Being around someone for that amount of time makes it impossible for no fatherly relationship to develop Daisy even agrees and has made statements about the kids seeing Woody as their father figure

Feminism,1615575692,Please use the search bar side bar wiki for this frequently asked question 
Feminism,1615575635,Ugh people who do this are the  worst  Like no dude putting your cell phone down on a machine and then going over to do something else is not gonna fly I m moving your phone sorry 
Feminism,1615575584,As I guy I almost wish I could go to a women only gym so there wouldn t be weirdly competitive men trying to claim multiple machines weights benches all at the same time  Gotta admit I ve never seen a woman do this 
Feminism,1615575551,It is definitely NOT okay If we women demand to exist and be treated equally as men we should demand it in every context  Segregation of the sexes in public spaces is dangerous and only reinforces sexual discrimination   Where I m from   such attempts of segregation are seen as dangerous Islamist interventions It s quite regressive not being able to share the same space with men There is harassment in the universities as well does that mean we should have separate universities too  Harassment is everywhere It is the harassment that should be not us  This paper explains a lot   
Feminism,1615575124,There is a women s only gym I would love to go there 
Feminism,1615575122,I never disagreed that men are as a whole more dangerous to women Rather I disagreed with that being the causality for men generally responding positively with being sexually harassed I m still rather curious as to what you see as being a biological causality 
Feminism,1615575059,She clearly has not read Lolita or if she has she missed the entire point of the book 
Feminism,1615596167,make sure to analyze yourself and your actions to uncover unintentional misoginy or machismo that s the first step anyways
Feminism,1615596057,Change my viewpoint On feminism The movement that afforded me most of the rights I have as a women in America and continues to fight for my personhood  Yeah no Misogyny is gonna have a really hard time convincing me I m worth less because I m a woman      
Feminism,1615595817,Yeah and nothing in my post history is non feminist I have never said anything non feminist I have just challenged anti male rhetoric Apparently you can t tell the difference between the two Sorry I forgot this was an echo chamber where everyone likes to pretend we are helpless victims and men are just gawking slathering rapists  instead of actually addressing real issues of gender inequality 
Feminism,1615595797,I haven t been here long but I really haven t seen any questions like that I have seen plenty of good answers that have expanded my understanding of feminism but questions Nah 
Feminism,1615595704,What I want to know is if  allmen is okay is  allwhitepeople and  allable bodiedpeople ok too 
Feminism,1615595468,Yeah you re right I m just scared he might never want to put in that effort for personal growth
Feminism,1615595209, gt  Things like  ladies nights at bars is not It s less of a  here s a safe space for women and more  women are the product we re selling  Wait do you mean a ladies night like  ladies get drink specials or  this is a night block of time where only ladies show up  I agree with you for the former  and aren t sure I ve ever seen the latter  but it s also different from what the OP is talking about  which is more in line with the latter if it exists  
Feminism,1615595189,I agree but also I m worried if I were to directly ask him these questions he might subconsciously answer the way he thinks I ll approve and not how he genuinely thinks
Feminism,1615594968,i think its a good idea but id rather them just check people prior to joinging
Feminism,1615594861,I don t understand why you think your experience is fact while everyone else s is just  anecdotal evidence  You are also not the only person who has ever worked in a gym  People don t report sexual harassment a lot of the time It s ridiculous to think that the only time it happens is when someone brings the issue to HR  Also side note isn t HR supposed to help the company deal with issues between employees not the customers  I was an instructor at a gym for years I knew a lot of women who would say things like  oh don t go into the weight room right now that one guy is there who always comments on womens butts or  that new guy keeps following me around the gym or  you know the guy that always wears the orange shorts he keeps making creepy comments when I squats  These things happen all the time and don t get reported for various reasons Maybe the woman is afraid of retaliation Maybe she s scared that she won t be believed Will they want proof Is the staff safe to confide in I was even told by the front desk guy that he wanted to watch me swim naked did I report it No I just kept my distance I m shy and hate confrontation  I m sick of the  It s not my experience so it can t be true mindset Also this isn t to say men don t have  insecurities or other problems just that there is a legitimate reason gyms decide to have a safe place for women whether you see it or not 
Feminism,1615594843,either way would work without putting a strain on our relationship Once I got his response I would likely just tell him it was a test and he would understand
Feminism,1615594605,More people get robbed than raped but nobody has proposed a curfew because there are thieves among us Where are the  I hate all men Twitter posts because it s mostly men that engage in theft    Funny how there are no millions of theft victims walking around permanently traumatized and venting their   metoo stories and hatred of men all over social media   Men have been to war where they died by the hundreds of thousands for Christ sake and if they came back and said  I hate all so and so of some nationality or race it would rightly be regarded as racist profiling or xenophobia In fact it is regarded as profiling when it comes to Japanese detention camps as it rightly should But feminists profile an entire gender and it s  activism  
Feminism,1615594590,She could just ask his opinion It can put a strain on a relationship knowing that the other party would rather misrepresent themselves than trust you to give an honest answer to a question 
Feminism,1615594526,That s less a theory and more an observation without an explanation for the perceived differences and the explanation is the interesting part Why do you think men and women view these things differently Do you think it s biological  iffy  or do you think there are social dynamics that cause men and women to react differently to the same or similar events relating to sexuality 
Feminism,1615594478,No they wouldn t These Men believe that they woukd be fine with harassment and catcalling but are the same ones that gag at the idea of dating an unattractive woman  happened to me twice or cannot be in a room with a gay man from fear of being harassed 
Feminism,1615594473, gt This attitude doesn t help our cause and is why many serious issues effecting women get sidelined What do you mean  our cause  You re clearly an anti feminist doing a shitty job of pretending to be a feminist to stir shit up You know we can see your post history yeah 
Feminism,1615594266,does OP what an honest knowing of his true thoughts or not 
Feminism,1615594195,Muslims aren t the group in power while men are Men set the standards in politics law moral and ethics in our society Muslims don t Also there are far more men who rape or justify rape than muslims who flew into the towers And those weren t even doing it because they re Muslims but because they were at war with the USA It s just ridiculous to compare this 
Feminism,1615593901,I don t know how to say I don t see why without being extremely ignorant or quite provocative   Let me try this i think they re saying  it s obviously unreasonable to label Muslims based on      there s a parallel with labelling  men based on rapists  I might be missing their intended point of course but if my understanding is about right what s the ignorant provocative bit 
Feminism,1615593879,Because a lot of men dont really see women as truly human but as an inferior being So we must be worse than them at everything 
Feminism,1615593534,To me it does The question is either extremely ignorant or quite provocative 
Feminism,1615593356,Somebody literally asked that a few hours ago please scroll through the sub 
Feminism,1615593313,We are not having a conversation about   kill all men again please use the search bar 
Feminism,1615593045,Don t be disingenuous Saying that is obviously implying that the information is somehow relevant i e you believe the law has some bearing on whether women can or cannot rape men  and unless you re being intentionally misleading you re implying you agree with the law 
Feminism,1615592949,I think it s a great idea Women need to be able to have some space to themselves and honestly some guys really mess it up I m thinking of places like gyms and dance clubs not banks or malls 
Feminism,1615592915, gt Was it a case of the truth being spoken loudly and people falling in line or was it a century of slow progress of making allies  first and foremost among women as we still to this day have nearly half of women vote contrary to feminist interests by communicating ideas For at least three hundred years whenever women have spoken about gender oppression regardless of what they re saying what tone they use how frank or soft their rhetoric is they are always cast as making too much out of nothing as using a too violent discourse of already having equality and now wanting superiority  I m not kidding I can show you   th century of men saying that there  used to be gender oppression but not anymore  Here s an example In the English speaking West one of the most respectful postures one can take is to kneel You can count this as the upper limits of  soft   non aggressive   inviting rhetoric Yet kneeling was somehow transformed into and talked about as a  thuggish disrespectful act The point is that there is no version of  inviting rhetoric that will ever win against people who actively want to deny the realities  the truth of injustice  gt And frankly how do you know this to be THE truth A truth even Anyone who looks can see the truth of injustice If you can t look you can listen If you can t listen you can feel it 
Feminism,1615592908,pretend you have a sexist view and propose it to your friend for example  lol look at this chick with an onlyfans what a whore  and see his reaction I hope you come up with something more clever than that lol but that s all i could think of on the fly
Feminism,1615592860,I can confirm from my required weights class since I played water polo women girls don t do this We were competitive at times but we waited when we wanted to do an exercise or started another to stall for time and we d say  hey I m go next lmk when you re done 
Feminism,1615592625,Women are followed and assaulted and verbally harassed by men who are in fact predatory I know this behavior isn t as easily noticed when you aren t a victim of it but predatory is the only accurate word for it It s creepy and animalistic in nature Not because we re naturally like this but because this is the only way these men know to approach women because they tend to see us as game or an end goal 
Feminism,1615592612,The part of the conversation missing here as women are told to be wary of violence is the subtext that men hear which is  You are violent   On top of carelessness men are more likely to be involved in violence from strangers because they are likely to instigate violence 
Feminism,1615592311,I ve found it s goes better to direct men who want to change behavior to resources like articles and books and let them know I m there to answer any questions as best I can You re not really in charge of his personal growth and if he wants to change he needs to put in that effort not you 
Feminism,1615592232,I have performed examples of this I own a company that produces events and I ll do an annual dance party on a yacht One time I did a ladies only one South Asians are my target demographic and the ladies really appreciated a safe space to go to Many are immigrants and having a place to be around without men once or twice a year was invigorating for them It s nothing I could sustainably do for all of my events but I think it could work Doing it in a bar is hard  will all bar staff and Dj or other entertainment be women It has its pitfalls in logistics too
Feminism,1615591129,What does the truth having to be spoken have to do with my statements the one I was responding to or the overarcing thread topic In addition while you are lumping me in with those who are unconvincable  for hyperbole I know  I assume you are familiar with the progress that has been made and will be made by the feminist movement Was it a case of the truth being spoken loudly and people falling in line or was it a century of slow progress of making allies  first and foremost among women as we still to this day have nearly half of women vote contrary to feminist interests by communicating ideas And frankly how do you know this to be THE truth A truth even Even within feminism there is little agreement on what constitutes a woman a man or anything in between or around There does not seem to be much of an agreement in regards to the role if any of non women in the movement How come it is so TRUE that anyone who does not take part in violence against women is allowing it Or is posting on Insta Twitter and FB enough activism that it counts In that case I am actively working against violence against people in general by the way Yay for the good guys 
Feminism,1615590439,No but they do touch on other reasons why women are uncomfortable with dick pics that do not apply to gay men 
Feminism,1615590069,I don t see other comments talking about gay men and dick pics
Feminism,1615589940,I think other top level comments addressed this much better than mine and are more comprehensive in general I d rather point people to those 
Feminism,1615589838,What about pictures from women that don t fit their narrow definition of beauty Would they still value vagina picts 
Feminism,1615589770,This question seems like it s flirting with transphobia Mind clarifying 
Feminism,1615589612,Hm I have a theory about this I know a few men who usually say that women are  bad drivers and I have found that they tend to think that a  good driver is one who can maneuver with both accuracy and speed Whereas most women I know tend to think that a  good driver is one who drives carefully and safely So when a woman is driving carefully and safely she might be overly cautious and maybe she won t speed much which is  bad driving in the eyes of some men who think the epitome of good driving can be found in the Fast and Furious movies  Incidentally that s probably why most car accidents caused by women are non fatal 
Feminism,1615589555,No It makes no sense the law I mean  peoole have been sexually assaulted before  pm
Feminism,1615589528,What about gay men being sent unsolicited dick pics Because if you look at gay dating apps that happens all the time I think there was another study that showed that gay men enjoy those in the same way straight men enjoyed vag pics as described by OP

Feminism,1615588505,Why shouldn t girls and women be encouraged in STEM Of course there are many sexist issues to fix in STEM education and careers However STEM just like any other interest should be equally promoted to everyone  Science and technology are also interests There are STEM adjacent hobbies too By gendering STEM interests we are contributing to an oppressive system STEM interests are still heavily gendered and we need to break this norm   That being said there is also work need to make these places equally accessible to everyone  Girls and women often leave STEM because of hostility towards them    Encouraging  women and girls is not going to fix the oppression system in STEM workplaces or schools however it will break the norm of gendering interest in STEM 
Feminism,1615587910,Thank you so much I ll look deeper into this it looks really helpful 
Feminism,1615587744,Sorry I do agree with the original comment in that American actors are way more glam than British men but the specific post is about men IN RELATION to their female counterparts None of the actors you mentioned have ever been paired with a stereotypically  ugly actress whereas stereotypically  ugly actors are often paired with attractive actresses in American media Not selection bias to note this

Feminism,1615586204,Side rant I think we need to find a way to be comfortable talking about behaviors even if there is an ethnic component to it Acknowledging a particular undesirable behavior happens more often in minority communities than in white communities doesn t need to be seen as confirming racist ideology It doesn t mean that those behaviors are genetic or otherwise inherent to ethnic minorities A lot of it is tied to a legacy of poverty more than anything else I m Afro Latina I can definitely say that there is more fear involved with walking alone ethnically diverse neighborhoods because those are the neighborhoods where I experience street harassment I can t even count the number of times that I ve been followed while walking alone I have not had that experience in white majority communities and I doubt that that pattern is unique to me IMOP the key to not being racist about it is understanding that the present higher prevalence of those behaviors doesn t mean that black and Hispanic men are inherently more sexist  You don t solve racism by pretending that these problems don t exist When you do pretend the problem isn t there it s not just the white hipster s fear that you re dismissing You re also dismissing the minority women who live in those neighborhoods and have a higher rate of victimization than suburban women

Feminism,1615584340,You are seriously reaching    This is a thread about  female only times at a gym and I am just saying why it would be preferable from my own experience If I was to go into a sauna I would feel more comfortable with other women as the one s at my gym are always full of men who obviously have a right to be there but it makes me feel uncomfortable to go into a confined space with multiple men who are strangers to me whilst wearing a bathing suit I can t relax or enjoy a facility like that I am not saying the men are going to rape me  seriously      where did you get that from   But that I would appreciate a women s only time slot

Feminism,1615607596,I don t necessarily think tampons should be free  at least not in the context of capitalism  I think they should be possible to obtain for free in some circumstances and settings and low cost otherwise just as condoms and toilet paper are Not having access to them is a health risk  and also limits the ability of women and girls  and trans guys NB folks who menstruate to participate in economic and social life It s also a cost that only people who menstruate have to bear and depending on an individual s cycle and budget that cost can be considerable I would like to see  single servings of basic models available for free in public institution restrooms like toilet paper and packs available for on request in particular circumstances like at schools universities food banks etc a bit like condoms 
Feminism,1615607018,I m from South America were tampon use is not widely extended amongst teenage and the most vulnerable women population But just as  RisingQueenx said poverty is the main reason why I think in my country s case period pads should be given for free to girls and menstruating women as has been said just like toilet paper soap and potable water is accessible for free in first world countries I recall during my early teens we used to ask amongst us classmates when we were on an emergency if anyone has a spare pad to give us We always share When you are a   year old girl in a Latin American country back in the early    s it was kind of taboo unfortunately We asked our teacher to had an emergency pack for those cases  I wonder about girls in places even less fortunate than us like some places in India  I recall the short film  Period End of sentence   and the middle East or some countries in South East Asia I think all menstruating women who struggle to afford their basic needs covered should get free period pads tampons  according to culture I guess  Now I know pads are damaging to environment but I hope we can come up with a solution that can be both friendly to young women s bodies and to our environment I think this should be paid by the state

Feminism,1615601454,I feel like you may be over estimating hours cool your friend is going to be with this test What you re essentially doing here is doubting whether your friend is a aligned with you on your views about feminism However instead of directly having a discussion about it you re trying to test them like a parent would test a child It s disrespectful and if they pick up on it they may not handle it as cool as you think 
Feminism,1615601238,Male here so I don t really have much personal experience But I d agree some form of sanitary product should be available to solve problems generally listed  here

Feminism,1615600772,That was my first thought too The pool I trained at would do that two nights a month 
Feminism,1615600299,Well that s on him not you And trying to push it too hard may actually make him feel more reluctant to pick up that work cuz it s not coming from  him seeing the need but his friend pressuring him  from his perspective    I have been friends with a  lot of especially obtuse cis het dudes for many years now They grow at their own rate and there s no rushing it Some of them aren t friends anymore some of them have grown in this area by leaps and bounds But most of them have grown very incrementaly one issue at a time as they vicariously or directly experience the results and consequences of how patriarchy and sexism affect women they are close to and very very gradual start to realize it affects them too and influences their behavior There s not really any rushing that process and sometimes that s meant distancing myself to one degree or another for my own peice of mind cuz I get impatient with thrm 
Feminism,1615599881,I agree I ve added a modifier to my statement trans women are a very diverse group of people with many body types and also might not have penises as well I used the statement because I was sensing gender essentialist rhetoric which excludes trans experiences Additionally the reasons trans women are targets are more complicated ranging from cis men feeling threatened by their attraction to them and feeling  tricked  and structural factors like homelessness brought upon by exclusion

Feminism,1615599052, you assign these things to  the patriarchy  which is just a round about way or saying you blame men and their oppressive ways for them It seems like a really convenient cop out anything that men are suffering from it s  the patriarchies fault Not like we as women perpetuate these cultural norms or anything right  I defined patriarchy as how it is defined in the dictionary A society that excludes women from power and disadvantages women over men in a systemic and cultural way We by definition do not fit that in the secular west I m not saying we have achieved perfect gender equality not at all But we  by definition do not live in a patriarchal society  If you need to revise the meanings of words to victimize yourself your ideology needs re examining  I don t really want to turn this into a  he vs she because if you compare the two worldwide women are still suffering more than men that cannot be denied And historically women have had their agency restricted as well But in the secular west we enjoy a litany of advantages over men and the fact that you have to ask  and are unaware of what they are shows that I was right and you haven t ever tried to empathize with men  Now this isn t to say we don t have disadvantages as well They work in different aspects  But since you asked ok You mentioned the draft Well not being drafted is a systemic law that we as women enjoy It s an advantage whether you want to blame men for it or not Our right to vote isn t predicated on the draft theirs is  You mentioned emotional unavailability Well that bleeds into my next point of male disposability Society views men s lives as expendable and women s lives as valuable Which is why we have had our agency so heavily restricted traditionally and why women have been oppressed worldwide in every culture Because if you completely objectify us it s clear that we are a valuable resource Perhaps THE most valuable The ability to give life Since men lack this ability their lives have been deemed completely expendable and this bleeds into every facet of our culture Violence against men is so normalized we never even think about it when we see it Can you name me a single movie that wasn t a horror film  because those by definition are supposed to horrify you that depicts women on the receiving end of the same kind of violence men are in The first  minutes of Saving Private Ryan Or any other of those fighting or war movies And when women are killed it s usually done off screen or in a less  excruciating manner  Female illnesses get more public awareness and funding then male Testicular prostate cancer gets    the funding breast cervical does  despite killing as many or more amounts of people  In countries states with unrestricted or highly liberal abortion laws we have more bodily autonomy Male infant circumcision an abhorrent practice is widely accepted and even perpetuated by women The circumcised penis is deemed  normal looking Female circumcision is recognized for what it is an abhorrent disgusting crime to commit against a non consenting infant  Being the presumed caregivers in divorce Insanely stacked divorce court against the non presumed caregiver which is almost always the father Especially if the father is the primary breadwinner he ends up more often then not paying for a house he doesn t get to live in and rarely if ever seeing his kids  Us Getting on average    of the sentence for the exact same crime as men Being      as likely to receive the death penalty for the exact same crime Living  years longer on average  We die at work at     the rate men do Public and post secondary education is leaving boys behind and using teaching models which have been proven to advantage women at the cost of boys This is clear in declining male education rates     of alimony is paid by men to women  Men make up    of domestic violence victims and    of non reciprocated domestic violence victims  where the victim isn t fighting back at all  yet not even   of shelters which are mostly woman run and funded accept them I dunno how you can blame that one on  patriarchy  Making up the majority of college acceptance graduates  scholarship recipients despite also making up the majority of enrolled students post secondary  Our blatant advantage in the dating market m especially if your young and pretty but being able to have companionship whenever we want it is something we take for granted And if you go further into this point it gets more blatant how much we control in dating We control sex we get to accept reject advances at our whim This may seem like a small thing but that s only because you have always had it To someone who has never had it it s invaluable  Our lives having inherent value by the nature of our birth See my point about male disposability  Being presumed the non aggressor in any confrontation between a man and ourselves  And lastly we have a complete monopoly on reproductive rights To the point where  no matter what we choose to do reproductively  it s how it goes down and the man has no choice but to go along with it He cannot opt out of parenthood  This point is so stacked in our favour that it s actually legal to commit paternity fraud You and I as women could hypothetically cheat on our partner get pregnant bear the baby and raise it as our partners and then get found out when the child grows and not only are we not criminally liable for the child but the man we did this too is still financially responsible for a child that isn t biologically his  it s also  completely legal in all   states to not tell the man you are pregnant and keep that mans biological child away from him   Baby trapping is also completely legal in all   states To the point where a woman can actually take a mans sperm from a condom impregnate herself even though he didn t consent to unprotected sex and then hold him financially responsible for the child When sleeping with women professional athletes are told to keep their used condoms for this very reason 
Feminism,1615598981,I was referring to the  ladies drink free nights  I haven t seen what you re talking about but I d be fine with it 
Feminism,1615598372,I find your depiction of trans women s features stereotypical In most cases trans women don t meet this standard you mention in one or more ways Intuitively if they did then they wouldn t be such an easy and therefore frequent target of sexual assault 
Feminism,1615598037,Then point this worry to him Don t be scared of being assertive in your questionings and make sure to him that being uneducated about something isn t bad that you re there to help him if he wants  assuming you are  
Feminism,1615597820,A lot of the Pornhub related questions here have challenged my views towards sex work  I was initially     against the Trafficking Hub movement but people here have made me think twice  some of the  men are trash questions have made me think more about how harmful general statements can be and a few posts I have made myself got some interesting yet differing answers I feel like despite identifying strongly with feminism I ve learned from some discussions in this subreddit that the ideology has flaws but that s okay at the end of the day a lot of us have a different definition of what feminism is 
Feminism,1615597732,That changed my views about being a feminist Or changed my views on a topic inside feminism If so then probably I ve read many valuable things on here But nothing I can recall specifically 
Feminism,1615597687,It s probably more likely because humans are more socialized for killing each other  through warfare than raping Yes we consider rape a worse crime because women were long considered essentially the property of men and not to be sacrificed like men were are in war 
Feminism,1615597649,How in tf is that their space It s a gym they don t even own The women pay to use those facilities too but then get harassed by equally paying dogs Also if they really want to only use the facilities they wouldn t be staring down a woman hard and would be minding their own business But did they Nope 
Feminism,1615597450,Uhhh   Fuck Mate I m not touching that with a ten foot pole 
Feminism,1615597421,Completely understandable But I have a cousin and really likes the option of having a safe space since there s noticeable scars on their chest towards the armpit area when they transitioned He s proud of it but don t want to get harassed over it when working out which has happened a lot  I don t think a lot of gyms around us are going to have a safe time for LGBTQ individuals like ladies nights especially since we re in a conservative heavy area but we re happy that the gym we go to let s him in during that time They definitely wouldn t let him in if other ladies there during that time aren t comfortable though 
Feminism,1615597277,Absolutely Finding and undoing internalized misogyny has been one of my biggest personal goals for a while
Feminism,1615597159,Here s what I can anecdotally say as a feminist aligned man Do not treat this like a test People aren t dumb and he picks up you re testing him to make sure he s  okay  that s a sure fire way to quickly lose their trust and possibly a best friend If he says does things that you find unsavory that is a reason in itself to stop being friends with him You don t need to try prod his psyche for where he might trip up and beyond that it can all too quickly become about proving your own views on the matter and about him than actually gauging his responses  the post a few weeks ago about guys giving a friend a bunch of scenarios when he called out another shared friend s as sexual assault the the flip side version of this   Treat like a discussion and if you think he has a questionable opinion on something  provided they don t cross a personal red line for you ask him why he thinks that try to clarify misconceptions and possibly try to gently nudge him in the right directly I can say personally that most guys don t want to hurt people but we might have learned bad lessons from the authority figures and peers in our lives that need to be unlearned  which is a long process in itself  Be careful not to treat that process as like a  pet project  though I know there are guys out there who are jaded towards feminists women because someone in their past treated them like a  problem needing fixing  If you want to discuss this stuff with him you could start with using a situation involving someone you and he are emotionally connected to like  I heard saw x say   sexist comment joke   catcall someone can you believe that   or  Y had a rough night out recently there was this guy who wouldn t leave her alone even when told him to  You even use yourself use an example from your life like being catcalled or when you felt like you were being followed or something By starting a conversation that s more personal you can then transition it into a discussion of harassment and consent One thing to note with the approach though is that personal connections do colour how we treat situations and he might say one thing with a generic example but act differently if he knows the attacker victim both You could also use big cases that appear in the news like the Sarah Everard one but that can be tricky as cases that are widely spoken also see alot of hot takes and can affect a person s responses Using examples where he might have not a formed an opinion yet are useful in grasping how he processes them and how he reaches the conclusions he does Hell if you even use  I was reading this book online recently and found out that   statistic    Cold statistics help avoid possible biases and can prevent a conversation being coloured by opinions of the people involved or prior reading which can lead to him answering in a more straightforward manner As I said previously though this can mean you get a sense of how he might act hypothetically but perhaps not in reality especially if he knows someone involved I don t there s any  right way to start this conversation  its a difficult and often personal topic and you know what approach to discussion works for him better than I ever could As to examples another  do not I would avoid is anything  conventional to get the most nuanced responses That s not to say you shouldn t use them as a jumping off point but most guys are going to say they support a victim if you say  x forced themselves on y  and you aren t going to learn much from that You might get a different response if you ask them about  z taking back some out their face drunk to their place  or  z bothering this person after being told now or  a grabbed slapped b s butt without asking  or even  a and b were having sex and b didn t seem to care when a felt like they wanted to stop  Likewise with harassment its easy for guys to say  catcalling is bad  but if you make a point about how someone harassed someone and no one helped particular if its a woman who s the victim with men as bystanders you might get a different response Non conventional scenarios make us question how we would react in those scenarios and often result in us understanding and verbalising our own views in a manner that more solid that just  sexual harassment assault is bad  I would also use a mix of genders People can and do act differently if it s  he on she vs  she on he  or  she on she vs  he on he  or with gender non conforming people   he she on they   etc I would try to insert these naturally as how he reacts to them will also give you an inkling into his views on gender stereotypes and LGBT people alongside his opinions of harassment and consent One thing I would also suggest possibly doing  but be careful in how you word it is ask if anyone in their life had ignored their consent or overstepped a boundary I know one of the most frank discussions I ve ever had with male friends is one guy saying  this girl in the club last week kept touching me and was being a bitch when I told to go away  not saying that s the best way he could of said just that s how he described it  I brought up how I d had guys grope me before similarly and said what they did was sexual harassment and even assault They all then came out with stories of men and women overstepping boundaries and coming the brutal realisation that  oh we ve all be sexually harassed or assaulted here  It was eye opening experience for all of us I would avoid alot of caution here though as it could lead to re living a traumatic experience they didn t want to talk about Sorry for the long comment hope anything I said can help 
Feminism,1615597106,capitalism also profits off of this and mostly men control the industries and have the most power so of course they wouldn t want to give up their privilege also the amount of people that don t realize they are sexist and misogynistic since its so normalized
Feminism,1615597096,I dont think they should exist Unless theres a mens only hour That just seems fair 
Feminism,1615597067,And when women don t wear makeup people comment on it either negative like or say something backhanded
Feminism,1615597055,There are plenty of good questions and many that help me refine my position but none that have outright rocked my world 
Feminism,1615596847,not all black people is used to fight a fake narrative that white people created black people are savage uneducated and shit to appear superior and justify their abuse and those stereotypes affect them even this days so a marginalized group fighting opression vs not all men that is used to silence women that speak on their struggles in society and changing the subject so the opressor silencing the opressed
Feminism,1615596562,in society there is a different treatmen to women an men women cant go out without being catcalled they get used to make products more desirable etc while men dont get that now that is important because it causes girls to get a huge ammount of attention because of how much they are viewed as objects and they cant leave that on the contrary men almost never get complimented or called beautiful because its deemed as unimportant to them that causes boys to generally like getting that  sexy object gets attention and thats also a problem on the catcalling thing because mens desire to be praised makes them think id like to get whistles on the street so they dont listen to women but this perception of men being desperate for sex and shit is also a problem bcs it makes people think men cant be sexually abused or that they should be grateful
Feminism,1615596483,Again even in America suffrage was restricted to most men like it was in other parts of the world Feminist simply want to rewrite history on this point to came a false oppression narrative Even today in some parts of the world men s civil rights are conditional on them signing up to fight in military combat Women never had similar obligations
Feminism,1615596171,Can I just ask a relevant question If we agree that men in general don t feel bothered as much as women with unoslicited nudes does that mean there  should be a double standard here In general should the discouragement we give towards men sending unsolicited nudes be  higher than to women sending unsolicited nudes 
Feminism,1615631007,Female animals are breeding machines until they re no longer  productive at which point they re slaughtered for low quality meat Cows have their babies taken away so we can use their milk instead Sows spend the majority of their lives in crates too small to even turn around in I know multiple feminists who are vegan for these reasons The only question is whether feminism extends to non human females and I m not knowledgeable enough to answer that 
Feminism,1615630967, gt I don t use or need supplements Without even supplements like B   Getting anywhere near    gram of protein per lb of bodyweight let alone  g of protein per lb of bodyweight of bodyweight seems like an impossibility with a vegan diet  gt Veganism is slightly more expensive than vegetarianism  because vegan milk is more expensive than cows milk but for me it hasn t been more expensive than eating meat It s probably been roughly the same cost for me eating vegan and eating meat Don t the extra veggies and stuff like almond milk or soy milk cost a lot Maybe then it depends where you live ig  gt Good thing I didn t say that then Wasn t talking about you specifically I know you didn t say that and that s nice But however there are some people who say things like that 
Feminism,1615630698, gt It feels like you re just trying to be victimised here I don t think so I m talking about other people who say stuff like that not the person that I replied to 
Feminism,1615630563,You literally said this  gt Personally I believe that this discourse the generalisation of men as a whole creates quite a dangerous and hostile ideology concerning the nature of men We are not all bad people and those that are it is not solely due to the fact they are male it is also due to the fact they are perverse individuals that often manipulate their physical advantages over women to gain power and dominance Talking all about the generalization of men and how all of you aren t bad people It s a typical   NotAllMen which is done to dismiss the struggles of women and to derail conversations like when it s about sexual assualt or the attitudes that men have over women as a whole and then derailing that conversation to make it everything about men rather than what women go through and reflecting on your attitudes 
Feminism,1615630116, gt all those supplements I don t use or need supplements I am not rich  I originally went vegetarian because I was broke and couldn t afford meat  Veganism is slightly more expensive than vegetarianism  because vegan milk is more expensive than cows milk but for me it hasn t been more expensive than eating meat It s probably been roughly the same cost for me eating vegan and eating meat   gt saying something like that you need to be a vegan to be a feminist sounds exclusionary Good thing I didn t say that then 
Feminism,1615629904, gt Now I m not going to attack people s feminism just because they are not vegan  gt I fully respect your choice to follow a vegan diet but saying something like that you need to be a vegan to be a feminist sounds exclusionary It feels like you re just trying to be victimised here
Feminism,1615629570,Yeah that s nice Vegan diet is not possible for everybody especially if you re not rich and be able to afford all those supplements but ofcourse people should have to freedom to able to eat whatever they want therefore also a vegan diet and I fully respect your choice to follow a vegan diet but saying something like that you need to be a vegan to be a feminist sounds exclusionary I want to be able to eat steak without the fear of getting lynched and also fully support the rights and liberation of women and therefore strongly oppose the patriarchy I don t see how they are mutually exclusive In the context of my country vegetarianism is often used to justify excluding people from usually marginalized groups from places like housing and to exert their sense of supremacy over others So looking at this further makes me dislike this imposed vegetarianism 
Feminism,1615629470,Do you mean how women say women should act and how men say men should act Because that s a pretty big spectrum right there 
Feminism,1615629293,Double standards aren t a good thing They ve brought about a lot of issues throughout history Especially in the face of women wanting jobs the right to vote and the right to have equality in all aspects of their life Which we STILL have issues with If anything I wished that they had never existed 
Feminism,1615629164,Not necessarily Veganism is economically infeasible and one has to be quite wealthy to get adequate nutrition from a vegan diet In fact Gujarat and Rajasthan  the most vegetarian states in India have the highest malnutrition and anaemia rates which affects the poorest the most and to be frank it is antithetical to the main aims of feminism for we don t want people to be discriminated on account of their gender either individually or systematically and veganism will merely enfeeble the poor 
Feminism,1615629148,A majority of men hold roles like police officers and security guards It s all a system of who is in which position And if someone is arguing that women who speak out against sexual assault are trying to ask for men s protection they re quite literally speaking out and making others more aware of what s going on Hopefully putting that particular person who committed the act behind bars It might also be good to bring up if men were to be sexually assaulted you hope that they go to the same length to protect themselves As they face entirely different obstacles 
Feminism,1615628942,For some people yes for others no The general consensus is treat living creatures with dignity and respect Which is a huge issue in the meat processing industry 
Feminism,1615628913,That person does not represent the sub s views You re falling into confirmation bias 
Feminism,1615628790,A double standard is conceptually understood as a bad thing isn t it It s not just treating people differently for similar situations Juvenile courts for example seem to be good thing even though their purpose is to treat people differently based on their age 
Feminism,1615628597,I work as a doctor and I love having some of the more difficult questions that are going to be asked beforehand Even though it is tempting to blame it on anxiety or stress or whatever seems to be the smartest solution I try my very best to always be honest about the things I do not know However that leads to the following problem usually If I don t know the questions that will be asked and then don t know the answer to the question I usually don t have the time to look it up or consult with more experienced colleagues during the booked hour So then I have to tell the patient that I will be reaching out later or tell them my findings in a next session If I had the questions beforehand then I could answer quicker better and more prepared So great way of doing that smart idea 
Feminism,1615628321,Take this for example Knife crime in London in the past couple of decades has been on the rise and the main perpetrators of these crimes have been black males So if I said that I fear black men when I walk around London because they might stab me what is the difference between that and what women say about men in general Men are the victims of violent crimes more often than women and therefore I have the right to be scared of knife crime  but does that also give me the right to make comments about black people that are the main perpetrators of such crimes in London Or on the other said there are men that often generalise all women due to the relationships they have had with women in the past Take for example the popularity of Juice Wrlds  all girls are the same or whatever It s fine for these men to have a mistrust of women in a romantic sense but is it fair for people like juice world to make songs that state all women are manipulative and emotionally immature 
Feminism,1615628196,Why does this sub seem like a such a battlefield for so many people People ask  admittedly simple and sometime dumb questions about Feminism  and hope to get a civil and intelligent answer It s not their fault for trying to learn more and ask questions 
Feminism,1615628031,Like I ve said in my post I m not trying to victimise men and I understand why women have a fear of men in general My issue is when you guys talk about men you don t merely generalise the threatening nature of men These comments often lead into others comments about men in relation to their opinions intellectual capacity appearance etc In what way is this rhetoric a rhetoric that aims to raise awareness about female victims through persecuting men as a whole useful 
Feminism,1615628027,So even though we want to be strong and independent men are still the ones with the majority of the power then when we require help from those in privileged positions we re deemed as not being feminist enough Put more women in power and we will rather ask them for help instead of the only people with the ability to help us  men   Don t even bother arguing against questions like that the men asking them won t care about the truth 
Feminism,1615627856,But the thing is I haven t said  not all men  I ve said the language feminists use can give the impression that they mean all men as was the case in things like the ACAB movement which can create dangerous and damaging opinions and relationships Responses like this do not help in this discussion whatsoever 
Feminism,1615627792,As long as you re examining the morals of either approach they do go hand in hand yes Don t abuse animals don t abuse women Technically you can be one without the other of course but you should definitely be both 
Feminism,1615627736,You are just hating on men not complaining about genuine issues at all People like you just make it harder for our cause to be taken seriously 
Feminism,1615627692,Nope you re not allowed to be toxic And also no you don t get to make decisions with regards to how I live myself 
Feminism,1615627615,Rape happens to men too but unfortunately  in my country men are the perpetrators of rape against men and women Men literally get laughed at when trying to report rape to the police while male on female rape isn t taken seriously enough male on male rape is taken even less seriously     Your sexism does not help the feminist cause at all Please rethink your prejudices you are only hurting us females by spreading incorrect information 
Feminism,1615627482,So I d argue that yes it is better to be both a feminist and a vegan I understand going vegan is going to varied levels of difficulty for different people and very many people will not be able to go full vegan any time soon I would say that the end goal should be veganism with a sense of  I ll still eat x and y because z for parts that are too hard I m basically just asking people to try their best  Now I m not going to attack people s feminism just because they are not vegan I tend to treat these things separately since it is just easier that way But for me I am vegan and feminist and a socialist and in support of BLM and in support of disability rights and LGBTQ rights for all the same reasons they seemed to be morally correct things to do 
Feminism,1615626565,You don t have to pander to anyone  I was looking more at the stereotype that Feminists hate men  which I do not think is true Then I see comments like this Reading about these men who are apparently  inconsiderate animals is not a great look 
Feminism,1615626431,I was already on my way becoming more socialist but discussions in this sub have really articulated arguments against capitalism really well For example of course I was aware of the unpaid labor that women do but simply put a society that doesn t pay women to bear children is inherently patriarchal Even with paid maternity leave from employers we are still miles away from fully compensating women for unpaid labor In other words I knew capitalism was problematic before but now I believe capitalism is inherently incompatible with feminism 
Feminism,1615626245,You don t know me and you haven t a clue what I do and what I don t in my private life Stop assuming things about me please  I saw bullshit I called the person out No being a woman or a victim doesn t give you a license to be a scumbag 
Feminism,1615625952,At my university there were some vegans that argued that animal agriculture exploits female animals  ex cows milk so not supporting that industry is feminist And on the flip side people who eat animal products are supporting the exploitation of female animals so they aren t good feminists  It s not a popular stance and I don t really agree with it but some people do 
Feminism,1615625479,So dissapointing how people like you come on this sub and are vehemently against  anti male sentiments  which are usually just women voicing their frustrations about mistreatment by men but are completely silent when it comes to the masses of anti women and anti feminist sentiments that are rife here and in the world 
Feminism,1615625460,I m just trying to be helpful here I ve seen a lot of people use this kind of language and it pushes people away 
Feminism,1615625212,don t you re not doing us a favour it s so exhausting to keep your rage within the boundaries of political correctness when men are ever ready to stop caring about your human rights if you offend them a little 
Feminism,1615625134,you don t need to type paragraphs out to attack my language what i wrote was an addendum to what i thought about the problem at hand not something i want op to say exactly jesus 
Feminism,1615625045,lol when a woman complains about genuine issues and you want to hyperfocus on her language maybe the problem here is your not caring about the issue to begin with

Feminism,1615644413,Warning I m a class A rambler this will probably be a long one First of all the fact that you have noticed this behavior about yourself and want to change it is the best first step you can take especially impressive to have this mindset at   years old You said that your gender is irrelevant but I think it s very relevant if you experience male privilege or not in this question I will assume you do The feelings of being resentful isn t uncommon at all infact I understand it To better explain I ll give you an example where I experienced similar feelings I m white and when I was younger I would have the same feelings when people of color would explain their experiences with white people I got defensive thinking  I would never say do that My friends wouldn t either etc  I realized pretty quickly how ignorant my response was Here are these people of color who have experienced racism their entire life trying to have an discussion about racism with white people  After reading all that my response was  But I don t do that   I understand how ignorant it is for me to be angry about generalization when they re talking about such a serious topic as racism To expect oppressed groups to stop generalizing when talking about discrimination is such a non issue The reason we do this is because we don t want to take accountability I ve never discriminated against a person of color but I ve definitely done it passively By saying  Not all X  I was minimizing the issue at hand By uncomfortably laughing when someone said a racist joke or being quiet when someone said the N word like it was any other word I was teaching the people around me that it s okay to behave like that Being a man it s hard and can even be shocking to hear women s stories about men and how they may resent men  But we can t keep tip toeing around the subject of discrimination After decades of discrimination women s voices and stories about sexism weigh more than men feeling uncomfortable After discriminating women for decades it s completely nonsense to expect women to also take care of men s issues which stems from a system men created to benefit men the patriarchy There isn t a magic pill you can take to understand the female perspective of sexism The only thing you can do is listen to women and understand the power of privilege You don t have to be a superhero that crushes the patriarchy every single day nobody can do that Like I said in my example earlier if you stop allowing  passive sexism in your everyday life that s a huge step Your question is hard because personally I think you ve already figured it out You understand how you feel and you understand that your feelings are an indicator to male fragility or machoculture and you re trying to change that

Feminism,1615643333,With the caveat that the other woman might be trans this is usually called a  one penis policy  if you d like to learn more about the discourse around it and it s pretty heavily criticized in nonmonogamous spaces The difference in the boyfriend s attitude towards his girlfriend sleeping with a woman versus sleeping with a man can reflect the oppressive idea that sex between women is somehow  not real sex  he s essentially subscribing the the belief that sex between his girlfriend and another woman is not threatening whereas sex between her and a man would be  And to the extent that the girlfriend anticipated this response when she decided to sleep with a woman she may have internalized this attitude as well  It is a choice made between two consenting adults  but the choices we make are also influenced by the society we inhabit and our choices also have the potential to challenge or reinforce oppressive norms This one falls into the latter category IMO I m not going to storm their bedroom and demand they do things differently but both people in this relationship should be giving real thought as to why their relationship holds these beliefs

Feminism,1615643149, gt I pointed out that it s fine for women to fear all men and that generalisations about men in terms of the threat they pose is fine  my point is that often these fears lead into other generalisations about the nature of men in general This is an important distinction to make and it seems that people reading these posts do not recognise this distinction The things you re saying is exactly the   NotAllMen this whole worrying about generalization of men and making it about men and derailing the conversation from the oppression of women  gt This is not a  notallmen post at all I am just concerned with people using issues concerning sexual harassment to make comments about men that are not explicitly related to sexual issues This same thing happens with race and men make the same generalisations about women as well usually in a romantic context What makes you so cocerned about this rather than the victims and what they go through And these generalizations aren t comparable due to power dynamics   gt This sort of comment that you make is what I think scares a lot of guys in this scenario You can be fearful of men in general because of the threat some pose and you can of course try to spread awareness to men about what sexual harassment is and how to prevent But you can t use sexual harassment by males as an excuse to discount men s opinions on certain topics you cannot use it to say men are intelligent and you cannot use it to say men are undeserving of certain luxuries You mean the usual men s opinions like dismissing that issue victim blaming trying their hardest to downplay those issues doing whataboutery and try to derail the conversation doing   NotAllMen Then ofcourse it s going to be dismissed 
Feminism,1615642815,See the thing is those questions have no relationship to the hypothesised assumption I have made about black people that commit knife crime in London The crime committed is different so you re not going to ask the same questions about the relationship between killer and victim whatsoever To ask questions specifically related to sexual harassment in terms of knife crime is absolutely absurd What I have done is drawn a correlation between the two Men are victims to knife crime on a scale larger than women and the dominant perpetrator of knife crime in various areas of the UK are black people Women are victims of sexual harassment on a scale larger than men and the dominant perpetrator of sexual harassment are men Hence we have two things that are the same so why is it any different to draw the same conclusions about black people as there are about men The fact that you have said it s racist also implies that the comments made against men are sexist   
Feminism,1615642718,For me personally it s all interconnected I m a feminist because I believe in abolishing oppressive hierarchies and I m vegan because I similarly think our treatment of nonhuman animals is abhorrent and unjustified I also believe very strongly that we need to dramatically reduce our carbon emissions to create a better future and veganism  appears to be the best thing we can do to that end as individuals    With that said  as with other systemic issues and other abolitionist perspectives it s rarely as simple as just making the oppressive system disappear Just like the existing economic system in the US depends on patriarchy to survive  particularly the value created by unpaid domestic tasks  such that just abolishing those practices without restructuring things would create major issues around for example childcare much of the world s food system  especially in wealthier countries has created structures of dependence on animal exploitation So part of the task of animal liberation necessarily involves interrogating those structures working towards food justice and fighting the commodification of food  which we should instead work to produce together and distribute to all

Feminism,1615642530,I haven t noticed that before and I don t know any feminist who is against men s mental health support or tries to gaslight men The only cases I can think of is when men insert themselves into a conversation about women s or queer people s issues trying to make it about themselves or when they expect feminists to create a space for them instead of doing it themselves But even then the problem isn t men s mental health but derailing the conversation and feeling entitled to women s labor 
Feminism,1615642402,Well I believe why men are more likely to commit violence is because theyre socialised into it for most of their lives  I was wondering that given that women are now becoming more accustomed to positions where violence is an option  police officers soldiers and the increase in media portraying women as capable of violence  female led action movies along with a sense of retaliation if it could mean anything 
Feminism,1615642149,I haven t noticed this at all At least on askfeminists I see a lot of discussion of men s mental health suicide depression etc As for how to change it when men post asking what they can do to support feminism I tend to include male support groups on that list I think encouraging men to seek this kind of mutual support is really important in improving male mental health outcomes because many men find themselves pretty isolated

Feminism,1615641571,I think it s useful to clarify here that a popular definition of veganism in leftist vegan spaces is  A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude   as far as is possible and practicable   all forms of exploitation of and cruelty to animals for food clothing or any other purpose and by extension promotes the development and use of animal free alternatives for the benefit of humans animals and the environment  So a person who is in a food desert and doesn t have good access to vegetables but seeks to exclude animal products or access them in a less exploitative way  such as dumpster diving could still consider themselves vegan even if they need to supplement their diet with animal products Veganism as a movement especially liberal veganism can definitely have classist elements but I wanted to clarify because a lot of people aren t aware of how many leftist vegans work to incorporate anti classism and anti ableism into the definition I think people also underestimate how barring the food desert scenario and other considerations veganism can often be cheaper than non veganism I became vegan through my ex partner who went vegan as a homeless teenager

Feminism,1615640663,I understand that men are more often the perpetrators of violence I was just wondering that given that fact and socialisation of women to recognise their violent capabilities if its possible that in the future the gap will close As for the bogeyman thing yeah I agree  gt am I just going insane over here  gt Yes hell yea dude
Feminism,1615640608,Black people and Muslims do face systemic racism and this results in racially motivated violence against them Again just because a news story drives women to recount times where they have felt unsafe or been targeted doesn t mean they think all men are doing these things Just that in the moment they don t know who does so they do certain things to make themselves feel safer If as a result of these stories men started routinely being targeted in public in the same way that black people and Muslims are then this would be a different conversation 
Feminism,1615640416,Probably people are looking at this from the view of traditional gender and monogamy roles If these are consenting adults who ve discussed boundaries then there s nothing bad about it  I go to this website to learn more about kinks and sexual play like this   
Feminism,1615639893,Nah What I think might be a possibility in the future at least here in LatAm is that the interest in separatism might grow 
Feminism,1615639876,Go away troll  The fact that you come here under a new identity tells me you have to hide your misogynistic posts  Otherwise there would be no reason for you to make up a new account just to come here to chastise a feminist  You didn t want to look like a raging hypocrite  It didn t work  You still look like one 
Feminism,1615639801, gt Vegan diet is not possible for everybody especially if you re not rich and be able to afford all those supplements This is misinformation The cheapest option for a poor person is to be vegan or vegetarian Meat is expensive Even fairly affordable chicken is a lot more expensive than rice and beans Vitamin B  is the only thing you really need to consider if you are strict vegan and it is pennies a day 
Feminism,1615639669, gt I mean I am no MRA Uh huh  Hard to believe when you rarely see someone rise to the level of petulance you just did that isn t an MRA It s no different than  Wah I can t support Black Lives Matter because I ve seen BLM supporters say anti white sentiments  If they can t see my feelings are more important than black lives than I just can t identify as a supporter of Black Lives Matter  Grow up 
Feminism,1615639574, gt Veganism is economically infeasible and one has to be quite wealthy to get adequate nutrition from a vegan diet This is false You can get all the protein you need from grains and legumes and it s definitely cheaper than a meat based diet Meat is expensive Ask any poor person Meat is an expensive luxury in most developing countries This is long established fact It takes WAY more resources to grow a cow from grains than to just eat those grains Chickens are somewhat more environmentally friendly but it s still more efficient and cheaper to just eat the grains If you want to buy loads of processed food in fancy packages then sure being vegan can be more expensive But that s certainly not a requirement to be vegan Rice and beans is vegan and is very cheap compared to meat You can even add very protein dense nuts and seeds and it will still be cheaper than a meat based diet 
Feminism,1615639521,Men are strong and independent per default but I m pretty sure they d appreciate it when someone stepped in and protects them whenever something happens to them too 
Feminism,1615638865, gt So if I said that I fear black men when I walk around London because they might stab me what is the difference between that and what women say about men in general Aside from the obvious racism  Have you ever had a black man openly admit to you that he d like to stab you Have you ever been told that it was probably a compliment if a black man told you he wanted to stab you Are you likely to be blamed if you are stabbed by a black man Is he likely to be apprehended tried and convicted for his violent assault on your person Are people likely to ask you why you were out in a place to be stabbed Are people likely to question what you did to draw the attention of this black man who stabbed you Are people likely to ask what you were wearing to attract the attention of the black man who stabbed you Are people likely to discredit your story of being stabbed by a black man based on your friendships with other black men If you were intoxicated are people likely to frame your intoxication as an irresponsibility in which your being stabbed by a black man is an inevitable outcome  Are people likely to assume that you were lying about being stabbed Are people likely to assume that you in fact invited this black man to stab you and simply regret the outcome because it didn t go as planned Are you likely to lose your friends and family because they don t believe you were stabbed by a black man Would your friends find it hard to believe you  because they ve never known a black man who stabbed anyone 
Feminism,1615638408,I don t see how feminist as a movement extends itself generally to non human females  Honestly saying veganism and feminina goes hand by hand it s kinda classist     If someone isn t a vegan it makes them less feminist Yeah I do think it s like this 
Feminism,1615637980,Not really I think there is a slight possibility here in the U S but your causal mechanism is wrong It s not enough to want to commit violence you have to be  competent in it which involves a degree of socialization and comfort with violence not afforded to women  For example you can see in U S data on  suicidal ideation attempts and completion   that women are more likely to think about or try suicide but less likely to kill themselves Men are much more likely to kill themselves and a lot of that is men s comfort and competence with guns  it s not like it s so much harder for a woman to obtain a gun in the US  The same is true of men s violence against others they are more competent because they have been socialized int it  So as U S society becomes more comfortable with the idea of women as soldiers and cops and other gun wielding occupations we can expect more women to become comfortable with guns and so more likely to use guns In which case we might see a rise in women committed violence but not solely women on men violence The female on male violence we do see won t be significantly political in the sense you have in mind if at all it will be women using violence in the same sorts of situations men do  And this is speculation but it seems to me the women most committed to the feminist movement will be least likely to join gun wielding professions  However much female on male violence increases we can expect a sharper rise for women s suicides  So no I don t think it s going to happen  Incidentally  lame is considered by many people  to be an ableist word   You might be using  insane a little too casually too 
Feminism,1615637479,I meant unintelligent  sorry Also in terms of men using  notallmen to derail discussions on sexual harassment I agree that this statement is true and I believe this is equally as damaging as the point I make   I think both sides of this debate are straying from the fundamental aim of the recent debates on sexual harassment to raise awareness about what sexual harassment is and how to prevent males from violating a woman s sanctity Both sides are using this debate to make comments on women men that are not explicitly linked or relevant to the discussion on male abuses of females and that is my concern 
Feminism,1615637179, gt am I just going insane over here Yes Like understand that overall men are the ones who perpetrate the most violence again women  and men and it has nothing to do with the  strained relationship between the genders   gt For example do you think the movement could grow more militant and possibly violent with more inaction from the systems No but it s a nice boogeyman to get people to be in favor of suppressing activism and progressive movements 
Feminism,1615637162,I pointed out that it s fine for women to fear all men and that generalisations about men in terms of the threat they pose is fine  my point is that often these fears lead into other generalisations about the nature of men in general This is an important distinction to make and it seems that people reading these posts do not recognise this distinction This is not a  notallmen post at all I am just concerned with people using issues concerning sexual harassment to make comments about men that are not explicitly related to sexual issues This same thing happens with race and men make the same generalisations about women as well usually in a romantic context This sort of comment that you make is what I think scares a lot of guys in this scenario You can be fearful of men in general because of the threat some pose and you can of course try to spread awareness to men about what sexual harassment is and how to prevent But you can t use sexual harassment by males as an excuse to discount men s opinions on certain topics you cannot use it to say men are intelligent and you cannot use it to say men are undeserving of certain luxuries 
Feminism,1615635761,Right but I said that because I was replying to someone who was making a ridiculous leap with zero evidence or logic applied Hitler being vegetarian doesn t mean vegetarians are somehow evil Some vegans being contradictory doesn t mean all vegans care more about animals than humans  You re right that many people are contradictory I have seen that many times already today 
Feminism,1615635533,     text Like   most   legumes  C   lentil   is of   sulphur E       containing   amino   acids      text Fat  A          grams  Protein  E                         It s clear that I m the only one here willing to do research so I ll post this here You are wrong You don t actually need supplements to live  Unless I m mistaken you re probably eating vegetables anyway otherwise you ve got a lot bigger problems on your plate than protein deficiency ever could be Please stop associating religious extremists with a problem with one kind of meat with veganity All of your arguments so far have been about beef There s so many more animals out there that suffer I m going to stop responding here Lentils are cheaper than beef Religious extremism isn t the same as veganism and doesn t give anyone an excuse to keep abusing animals An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind etc Best of luck
Feminism,1615635467,Personally I don t think so I think it s a complex issue because there is no such thing as ethical mass production of food whether it involves animal products or not Vegetables and fruit don t pick themselves and farm labor at scale is  rife with human rights abuse   Ethically produced food is expensive and it s doubtful that you could feed the planet with it It took the Haber Bosch process for agricultural output to reach current levels which has its  share of problems   Economic and environmental aspects  and having the entire world move away from it is no easy task There are a number of good reasons to keep consumption of meat low but the ethics of getting rid of meat  let alone other animal products entirely are a lot more complicated 
Feminism,1615635268,I don t want protection I just want them to stay out of the way 
Feminism,1615634743,Oh jeez I was hoping the  yokes would catch your attention more but perhaps it did because you totally missed my earlier comment about the patriarchy and individual responsibilities
Feminism,1615634660, gt If you are able to obtain steak despite government regulation on cow slaughter and the actus of right wing religious extremists I genuinely doubt you can t afford lentils beans or whatever There are ways to get it But to get an equivalent amount of protein you would have to eat a huge amount of lentils  gt Again no one here is forcing anyone to go vegan they are merely pointing out that it is the best thing to do morally if you can That depends on the person Some vegans want others to be vegans while other vegans see it as a choice But where I m from lacto vegetarianism keeps on getting imposed which I don t like and it s often used as a way to justify discrimination against marginalized groups in places like housing It has a caste and a religious angle to it  gt I m just saying that long ago the same arguments you made against protecting cows are the arguments people have made to restrict the rights of other people in the past All that the vegans are asking is that you really evaluate your opinions and understand that you don t need meat to live This cow protection have been used as a way to justify lynchings against minorities by those communal hatemongerers who want to try to hurt minorities in every way they can and to display their fascism Here it s actually used to justfiy discrimination and hate I know there are people who can live without meat but it s really heard to do so unless you re rich and live in places where all those supplements and different kinds of veggies are available 
Feminism,1615633863,Is it an echo chamber or are you just wrong You are very much assuming we all think the same  which is not true Belittling too considering everyone is saying you are wrong and you just want to chalk it up to echo chamber rather than us being cognizant enough to call you out I think maybe you are very idealistic about men I get it I too would rather be in that world Unfortunately that is not the world we live in and there are     s of years of progress we have to make before getting to the point where trust in men exists 
Feminism,1615633605,If you are able to obtain steak despite government regulation on cow slaughter and the actus of right wing religious extremists I genuinely doubt you can t afford lentils beans or whatever Again no one here is forcing anyone to go vegan they are merely pointing out that it is the best thing to do morally if you can  I m just saying that long ago the same arguments you made against protecting cows are the arguments people have made to restrict the rights of other people in the past All that the vegans are asking is that you really evaluate your opinions and understand that you don t need meat to live 
Feminism,1615633605,Feel free to check out the sub rules and abide by them 
Feminism,1615633582,Yokes I m a little worried you are a bit racist that you want to compare the group men  who are societal aggressors to Black people  who do not have a unifying aggressive feature  as no race does  
Feminism,1615633434,I don t know why you started with  btw I m a woman   When you have to qualify your statement does that make you wonder if it s the wrong thing to say I think you re totally ignoring the fact of what reality is when it comes to the patriarchy It sounds like you dislike when we say men do these behaviors and maybe it s more palatable to hear patriarchy does these behaviors I gotta tell you there is also individual responsibility at play here  Most people on this thread have had an uncomfortable interaction with a man at the gym given that we are talking about it here So maybe think that men at the gym are sometimes a problem  Women do get harassed by men I really don t get what you re saying here  How does it make sense to flip it on women We aren t the aggressor towards men on a society wide basis while men are the aggressor towards women  and other men on a society wide basis
Feminism,1615633294,It s not an actual double standard but anti feminists seem to be quite salty about the biological reality that we can opt out of the process responsibility of pregnancy at different stages 
Feminism,1615633240,That s a leap I might need evidence for  How tf do you go from someone believing all sentient creatures deserve basic rights to somehow that same person believing certain people don t deserve basic rights  That makes a negative amount of sense If anything it would make more sense for the opposite to be true If you a willing to extend human rights to animals that are fundamentally different from yourself that you can t even communicate with it stands to reason you would also want to ensure all humans have those rights and more no 
Feminism,1615633170, gt Beans lentils chickpeas etc have all the protein I need  gt  gt B  is artificially added to vegan milk in my country Also btw it is also artificially added to cows milk anyway That s nice So it s already fortified with the supplements I didn t know they were But for me personally I find it very difficult to get enough protein on days where I m forced to eat vegetarian due to the religious superstitions of my parents But then again it depends on your diet ig  gt No It might be because of where I live but meat is just really expensive and buying beans and lentils is so much cheaper It depends on the type of milk that you buy but vegan milk is usually a bit more expensive than cows milk I m lactose intolerant though so didn t make a difference for me personally since lacto free cows milk is quite expensive Lactos free cows milk is a thing TIL So for vegan milks even within them there s a significant difference in cost 
Feminism,1615632774,Maybe it could be divided by students non students as well I ve had  creepy encounters with older people at the gym when I was in high school  At one point there was a   yo man who would talk to me and hit on me  ask me for my number and all that  when I was    It was highly uncomfortable and after I denied him I felt like shit seeing him again so I had to change up my gym routine to avoid him The other instance was when someone from my school administration  a fellow woman  took a picture of me while I was working out The administrators at my high school all made me uncomfortable because at the time I had an eating disorder and they all took it upon themselves to make  positive comments about it 
Feminism,1615632752,Honestly I don t see women saying men need to protect them from rape unless you consider not raping someone protecting them from rape  Women have been fine setting up sexual assault crisis centers on their own working on changing police procedures around sexual assault investigations on their own etc   RAINN and MeToo were both founded by women  It s been women in law who have done the most work for sexual harassment and sexual assault laws  And if we are talking about police forces well   there are women in police departments and while that tends to be a very male dominated and macho field it s extremely hard to make the argument that it is that way because women demanded it  So I would ask why this person thinks women are expecting men to protect them  To me the evidence suggests that women are quite willing to try to protect themselves and each other they just want men to not make that protection more difficult 
Feminism,1615632525, gt No one is lynching you for eating steak That depends on your country In the West they don t But in my country they do You have mobs lynching people who they even suspect have eaten beef because it goes against their religious nonsense  gt Essentially you re saying that you should be allowed to do something because you like it Your right to pleasure is more important than an animals right to live Yeah I m talking about freedom the freedom to have whatever diet I like I don t want the government telling me what should I eat While I agree the meat industry is quite exploitative I would support something like lab meat which minimizes the enviromental impact and also the harm on animals But right now having good nutrition is important and I m not rich enough so I can t afford all these expensive veggies and types of milk so meat acts as a great source of proteins  gt Would you not also say that a serial killer kills because he wants to Or an abuser abuses because they like it I personally don t feel like these three examples are equal to eating meat but it s the same train of logic no No That comes at the expense of another human being and their rights But we re talking about animals who were specifically bred for that and we need some good nutrition 
Feminism,1615631684,No one is lynching you for eating steak Essentially you re saying that you should be allowed to do something because you like it Your right to pleasure is more important than an animals right to live Would you not also say that a serial killer kills because he wants to Or an abuser abuses because they like it I personally don t feel like these three examples are equal to eating meat but it s the same train of logic no 
Feminism,1615631495, gt Getting anywhere near    g of protein per lb of bodyweight let alone  g of protein per lb of bodyweight of bodyweight seems like an impossibility with a vegan diet Beans lentils chickpeas etc have all the protein I need  B  is artificially added to vegan milk in my country Also btw it is also artificially added to cows milk anyway   gt Don t the extra veggies and stuff like almond milk or soy milk cost a lot No It might be because of where I live but meat is just really expensive and buying beans and lentils is so much cheaper It depends on the type of milk that you buy but vegan milk is usually a bit more expensive than cows milk I m lactose intolerant though so didn t make a difference for me personally since lacto free cows milk is quite expensive 
Feminism,1615631223, gt Setting aside the lynching why do you want to eat steak It s a genuine question I m not judging That s because I like to eat it It tastes good and contains a lot of protein and the essential amino acids Also as a way to express my freedom in a place where you can get lynched for eating it

Feminism,1615655247,I follow the Dan Savage school of thought in stuff like this  Cheating in this context is still bad and transgressed the boundaries of the monogamous relationship but infidelity is not always a relationship extinction event In this case the two primary partners have found a middle ground where both parties are getting needs met that might not have otherwise come to light without the cheating If they are able to move past that and it becomes beneficial all good If however there s mistrust and lingering resentment then the primary relationship may be damaged beyond repair and no amount of fetishizing bisexual women is going to save what is already broken 
Feminism,1615655126,Wow my friend Consent sounds like the least of your issues It sounds like your relationship is in a really rough spot Sex can be a barometer for the health of a relationship When the relationship isn t in a good place sex plummets It can be a symptom of a deeper issue not the actual issue itself If the solution you and your wife came to was to schedule regular sex it might be that you and her are trying to treat the symptom  no sex instead of the root cause If there is a unresolved root cause that is making her not truly want to have sex with you you most definitely could pick up on that She may even say the words  I enthusiastically give consent and want to mean it but we can t force our bodies to be into sex that we don t truly want And you deserve a partner who is genuinely enthusiastic about the idea of having sex with you I don t know what is going on with your wife but there s something deeper at play here that no amount of verbal consent is going to fix

Feminism,1615655008,I mean the man is still behaving as if lesbian sex is not real sex if they are truly in a monogamous relationship Think of other situations where a partner may have wanted to explore some that their partners doesn t or have sex with someone that has features that their partner doesn t take bdsm or a very large breasted woman while their partner has small breasts Would  those situations warrant exploration and would this couple still consider themselves monogamous 
Feminism,1615654878,This is a great question   It s not an uncommon scenario and I think you ll get a variety of opinions on this For me the answer is kind of complicated Going by the quote  she feels no need to explore with other men  I certainly wouldn t consider it to be  as problematic because the man isn t imposing a view on who she can and cannot date on the basis of gender I would consider that a private personal decision about who she wants to pursue in a nonmonogamous relationship rather than an OPP where you have a  policy or agreement with your primary partner With that said I still think this can get dicey Part of this stems from my own experiences I m a bisexual woman aligned nonbinary person   I ve dated a few bisexual women who are in primary relationships with men or who have mostly only dated men Some of those relationships have been really positive in other situations I ve felt very strongly that I was not really being seen as a person but more as a novelty or a way for the person I was dating to validate her bisexuality and her attraction to women So in general I feel wary of people who are looking to date a certain gender for the  experience of it Dating a woman is not the same as dating a man but the experience of dating one man is also very different from the experience of dating another and the same goes for two different relationships with women Particularly in the bisexual community I think it s easy for a weird sort of fetishization of a specific gender to emerge If you look through bisexual meme pages you see a lot of memes like  Yes i m bisexual I m attracted to women because women are incredible and I m attracted to men because i love making bad choices  And I think that s something to challenge because it puts women on a weird pedestal  even as it also puts down men  Sorry that went a little off topic I guess ultimately I still think it s something to interrogate What does someone think they will get out of a relationship with a woman that is different Do they have unreasonable expectations of their potential partner etc But I think of it a little more positively than having a rule imposed by someone who doesn t take relationships with women seriously   By this I mean that I don t identify as a woman but my experiences in the world are generally similar to those of a woman because most people read me that way 
Feminism,1615654610, gt But however they don t contain all the essential amino acids but however that they can be done by combining it with rice or wheat making it a complete protein so you can t have them individually you would have to combine it with something You would need to have that right combination Your link shows that they do have all the essential amino acids though  all plants do Protein combing is a myth though The original author who started it retracted it on later books and the idea was popularized by Vogue magazine in the   s with no science supporting it Amino acids are very very easy to get  You could literally just eat potato s and get all of them

Feminism,1615654283,You never touch or have sex with your wife because you can t be sure if she s truly consenting 
Feminism,1615654189,I know it probably sounds stupid But this the conundrum This has actually been my answer to the problem regarding my wife 
Feminism,1615654116,I don t see why absolute consent can t exist If two  or more people enthusiastically agree to have sex with no coercion that would be absolute consent Just because the waters of consent can be murky sometimes doesn t mean that absolute consent is impossible 
Feminism,1615654098,No we can t but I don t know what the purpose is of this discussion If you really think you can t truly ever obtain consent because you can t read someone s mind you d just never have sex again

Feminism,1615653775,I don t even know how to answer this I have absolutely been extremely enthusiastically consenting to sex many times 
Feminism,1615653729,Do you mean when I said  gt If you have the ability to not kill or abuse animals to eat it s definitely better to do so  gt At no point have I said that it s the ultimate objective decider of moral relativism  
Feminism,1615653612,I don t think it s inherently  feminist to make  or respect a choice Certainly I wouldn t criticize someone s choices within their relationship since I know from personal experience that relationships can get into pretty weird territory but I don t think this is relevant to feminism A feminist take could very well be  forgiving the cheating just because it was with a woman is disrespectful towards same sex attraction  even if the same feminist making this observation does not actually intervene in the relationship 
Feminism,1615653595,I hate to break this to you but this sort of thinking is what creates men that struggle to talk with women about these issues Talking about  fragile male egos  saying  you assholes etc stating how we can t even try to understand what you re going through does not help the situation Believe me I want to understand and I really would like to try and be part of the solution and not the problem But if women like yourself want to encourage more men to stop being  assholes  or at least to get more men to call out those that are being  assholes  stop using the phraseology of racists antisemites islamophobes sexists etc to belittle and target men If anything this does more to stray many further from the fundamental issue of sexual harassment as opposed to bringing men s attention to it  P S I am sorry for the harassment you have faced I too have been a victim at times but I know that is not as incessant and damaging towards males 
Feminism,1615653398,Baroness Jones is claiming that now but I m not buying it She was in the House of Lords when she suggested a  pm curfew for men I don t think it was a reply to a comment made by anyone else there and it isn t the place where people make ridiculous suggestions to counter ridiculous suggestions reported in the media She is a member of the Green Party who are pretty irrelevant in the UK so I think it might just be an ill conceived publicity stunt Politicians being politicians I feel sorry for Sarah s father boyfriend etc having to read things like that  before her death had even been confirmed and her mother and other female family  friends having to read the  advice to stay at home

Feminism,1615652328,I agree that people are often unnecessarily rude to vegans but I think it s that exact  moral superiority that annoys people I mean right here in this thread there s a person who compared  eating meat because you like it to  being a serial killer because you like murdering people  and then agreed that anyone who  isn t vegan is a bad person That shit is just unnecessary 
Feminism,1615652285,So I just went and looked more into the OPP and  I have some questions  if you wouldn t mind helping me out  I m trying to fully understand the issue I feel like I am at a disadvantage for really understanding because I am not fully immersed in the LGBT community I try to keep up but I don t always know  Let s say there s a heterosexual couple and the women recently decided she s bi She had grown up in a conservative home and never explored the female attracted side but he husband encourages her to express when she sees people she s attracted to  ie in movies and things   This turns into permission to test out her female attracted side Her male attracted side has already been explored and she has settled and enjoys her husband so she feels no need to explore with other men  Is this still oppressive ideas parading as something else  Can you have the set up where the woman can be with other women without it necessarily being spawned from those kind of  not real sex beliefs 
Feminism,1615652213,Seriously dude This subreddit is called  Ask  Feminists   not  Ask Reddit or  Ask Anyone with an Opinion About Feminism  People come here specifically seeking the opinions  of feminists  therefore it holds that only feminists have the right of direct reply Non feminists may participate in nested comments provided they do not break any other sub rules 
Feminism,1615652043,God this is exactly the reason why this stuff is an issue If you want to solve sexual harassment by making men uncomfortable instead of presenting arguments that build bridges between men and women that demonstrate to men how many of them have wronged women you will not achieve much This focus of a movement to make men uncomfortable as opposed to just trying to raise awareness about sexual harassment is absurd 
Feminism,1615652034,Sexual assault is one of the easiest crimes to get away with Easy enough where I saw Twitter thread from a rapist s perspective explaining how to get away with tape Not everyone is going to have their assault captured on multiple cctv cameras unless it s a blitz attack that happens outside in a big city like mine but that s if you re  lucky enough to have it captured Not everyone is  lucky to have multiple witnesses Want to know why Because rapists don t usually rape in front of other people unless those other people are partaking in it Some victims don t go to the hospital police immediately after for a myriad of reasons I run a statistically small chance believing a liar and it s a fact whether you want to accept it or not 
Feminism,1615651913,In my opinion your responses epitomise everything that is wrong about these discussions You and many other feminists are constantly going back to labelling every opinion on this topic as just a  notallmen post However as I have explained many times I am concerned about victims of sexual harassment and I believe that is the fundamental issue at hand But people use this as a pretext for the shaming of others for reasons not related to sexual harassment Also how is the generalisations about race women different to generalisations about men They are all concerned with a victim perpetrator relationship And the reason I am concerned about generalisations at this time is because of the fact victimhood should never EVER be seen as an excuse to belittle others for unrelated reasons no matter who is doing the generalising It is not a healthy way to start a movement and bring awareness to a central issue 
Feminism,1615651911,The socialization of male violence goes a lot deeper than that 
Feminism,1615651785,Interesting In the contexts I m familiar with  seperatism refers to essentially self segregating in general  i e woman only  communities  not just spaces and organizations  I suppose the word is being used differently by different groups 
Feminism,1615651635,No free thought got it I shall remove myself Thank you
Feminism,1615651616,Thanks    TBF I usually don t I have a lot of non vegan friends and family members who I love and do not consider to be bad people But people like to attack us so much for the tiniest thing I think I deserve to sometimes allow myself to be proud of the changes I have made to my lifestyle and diet for the sake of the environment and animal welfare 
Feminism,1615651093,Yeah don t preemptively announce that you re not trying to find out where someone lives if they haven t brought it up first that s just creepy and would make me think you were if it hadn t crossed my mind before
Feminism,1615651067,I don t think I ve ever met a vegan who openly admits they enjoy looking down on non vegans so uh kudos I guess 
Feminism,1615650905,TBF it seems pretty obvious to me that if it is reasonably possible for you to not cause harm to a sentient creature it is probably morally better to not cause harm than to cause harm I m not going to attack anyone or call anyone a bad person for causing the harm anyway because I don t think that that does anyone any good but I will enjoy the view from my moral high ground 
Feminism,1615650553,Having a fetish doesn t make you a bad person Cheating kind of does As long as everyone is happy the arrangement is fine The only slight issue is that all must remember that relationships involving two women are just as serious as those that involve a man and a woman So don t get into the  it s not cheating because it was another woman territory That doesn t mean that it s not ok to set a boundary that she won t have sex with other men but she will have sex with other women though But all parties need to think about why they find that acceptable For example if she is sexually attracted to women but not romantically attracted to women that is honest and as long as nobody objects go for it If it s because the boyfriend doesn t take relationships between two women seriously that s homophobic 
Feminism,1615649919,I don t think it is a bogeyman and is more an actual experience that the individual is having 
Feminism,1615649694,let s  a typo don t understand youe needless rage check your conscience at the door women unite 
Feminism,1615649644,Please respect our  top level comment rule   which requires that all direct replies to posted questions must come from feminists and reflect a feminist perspective Non feminists may participate in nested comments only Comment you won t get another warning 
Feminism,1615649504,Fair enough on a per gram of protein basis lentils actually cost less than meat But however they don t contain  all   the essential amino acids but however that they can be done by combining it with rice or wheat making it a complete protein so you can t have them individually you would have to combine it with something You would need to have that right combination But for getting a high amount of protein with lentils it isn t easy to do that According to  this   nutrition source the amount of protein in one cup or    g of cooked lentils is     g with    kcals but however that isn t a small amount of lentils you would have to eat a lot of them To just even get like   g from it you would need to consume more than a pound of it along with something else so as to make it a complete protein further increasing the calories to get that For the lean cut of beef the  amount   protein in it is   g per    g with    kcals or about   g per    g and    kcals That s more than twice the amount for a slightly higher kcals while for beef you can get   g of protein for just eating slightly less than half a pound of it which is much easier to do If you re someone who wants to eat a lower calories diet but still wants atleast like    g of protein then getting it done using a vegan diet isn t easy there s too many carbs in lentils to let you get the high amount of protein in a lower amount of calories so you might require protein supplements which then costs a lot of money 
Feminism,1615649036,Actually I m speaking about Latin American feminism I said  I think most feminists HERE  meaning Latin America do practice separatism in some degree and the following statements between parentheses are examples of that I understand that it s not what US feminists think but it is here in Latin America 
Feminism,1615648957,Sure women doing all the work for dudes   That s not a new one 
Feminism,1615648848,Well she cheated  wrong He fetishizes them  wrong BUT if they are both happy I don t see no issue 
Feminism,1615648728,She messed up by cheating Maybe he does have a fetish or interest in watching woman on woman action And yeah it s a bit problematic that some guys fetishize female bisexuality But this couple seems to have come to an agreement  I ve also heard of the  one penis rule which as mentioned does not take into account pre op trans women  That said if I had friends with such an arrangement it s really none of my business  or anyone else s  If that s what makes them happy who am I to judge 
Feminism,1615648536, gt most feminists believe men shouldn t call themselves feminists Speak for yourself 
Feminism,1615648478,And my responses seem to show your opinion matters to me  Yet here we are
Feminism,1615648211,Not sure anyone is a  bad person but this isn t a healthy relationship  The BF might find this  sexy but he s on the outside looking in and will likely get hurt  If the GF actually cares cared about him she should cut ties for the same reason  So she can cheat but he can t  So much to digest here   all of it will give a stomach ache 
Feminism,1615647897,As a pansexual woman I would find both of their behaviors problematic  Hers for cheating while in a monogamous relationship and his for seeing her relationship with another woman as less valid threatening 
Feminism,1615647812,Haha well yes but that s not generally the  free tampons argument 
Feminism,1615647799,It is called that way here in Latin America For the  M demonstrations there is usually a strictly women only block which is called the  separatist block  for example  here    I get that in the US and other places you might have different meanings for that word but that s how we use it here 
Feminism,1615647495,Having women only spaces  and other safe spaces is not  separatism  
Feminism,1615647354,i mean I think they should and so should toilet paper and food and every other basic living necessity living should be free for everyone
Feminism,1615647314,I think the sad thing is whether Allen abused Dylan or Mia coached her either way she was abused as a child and that is really sad 
Feminism,1615647200,The  double standards people point out aren t double standards and honestly sometimes the things people say are just kind of dumb      Like the reason it s more ok for women to say they hate men compared to men saying they hate women is because the women who  hate men are usually at worst annoying the men are usually murderers and rapists 
Feminism,1615647081,when men feel genuine fear going outside because someone might kill you specifically because they re a man then I ll accept  not all men 
Feminism,1615647004,Yo that is so true That s the same thing I was thinking You re right and people don t see it like this but it is very problematic and can be terrible for a plethora of reasons 
Feminism,1615646957,For me the questions usually don t but the answers often do 
Feminism,1615646575,The gf is a bad person for cheating She just got lucky in not facing any consequences The bf is   maybe not bad per se  but kind of dumb for thinking with his penis Just because he finds it  hot doesn t change the fact that he is still in a relationship with a woman who lied to him and betrayed his trust It makes me think he doesn t care about women s minds or hearts at all only their bodies 
Feminism,1615646553,The people in this  arrangement might be content but the comments are right Both of these people are walking red flags and I wouldn t want to be friends with folks who cheat fetishize my sexuality who think that homosexual cheating relationships are somewhat more permissible than heterosexual ones that sex with women is implied to be inferior to sex with men  ah  and so on     I find these people distasteful and if more folks have this mentality it will soon become toxic for the lgbt community and for women who date men  probably already the case  
Feminism,1615646539,Separatist as in not having anything to do with men unless it can t be helped To be fair I think most feminists here do practice separatism in some degree  most feminists organizations I know are women only it s a common practice to ask men to refrain from attending feminist protests on March   most feminists believe men shouldn t call themselves feminists and so on  
Feminism,1615646381,I know   I ve been stared in the gyms for years My response is to look them back dead in the eye  Out on the streets much worse things happen to us but we never give up on going out and living our lives as we should In the end everyone is free to have or demand women only hours or spaces I think it radicalizes women as a gender and reinforces sexism and therefore I do not support it That s my take
Feminism,1615646182,Choice feminism is counterproductive Choices do not exist in a vacuum  comic  
Feminism,1615646174,A couple thoughts on this  If they wouldn t let him in if women are uncomfortable then it isn t truly trans inclusive It s just the only thing available for him   Saying  other ladies in the context of that last sentence makes it sound like you consider him as a lady from how it reads which I doubt is your intention or how you see him I just wanted to point that out because language and context is important and conveys more than surface level meaning especially with the subtle nuance in gender topics  Saying  this is understandable and following with a  but negates the initial statement Yes my views on this are valid So are your cousin s as another trans person In my original comment I even said that not every trans person will look at this the same If the only option is a women s time slot that is open to all trans people then we would have to be okay with that out of necessity What is better is an LGBTQ specific time slot but that isn t a common practice in gym settings so we are forced to accept women time slots or not I don t but your cousin is certainly within his right to make his own decision with that  I d be interested in hearing from your cousin first hand on this rather than someone speaking on his behalf I m sure if given the option of a women s safe space and a LGBTQ  safe space he d probably prefer the latter because then he doesn t run the risk of being shut out if women in the their dedicated space don t want him there 
Feminism,1615646083,I mean Yeah  If you have the ability to not kill or abuse animals to eat it s definitely better to do so  At no point have I said that it s the ultimate objective decided on moral relativism
Feminism,1615645959,What is acceptable and what isn t within a private relationship is the right and responsibility of those parties involved Whether shes s   and he s   isn t within your realm to decide comment on nor pass judgement In the    s it wasn t anyone s business of two gay men or lesbian women were in love In the    s it wasn t anyone s business if two people of different skin tones dated and married  People will choose for themselves what is and isn t for them  Choice It s truly the only unique thing we have that s absolutely our own 
Feminism,1615645856,That s also not just the definition used by leftist circles It s the definition used by the society that originally came up with the word 
Feminism,1615645832,I think labeling anyone a bad person over sex that is between adult humans who consent to it is being a bit harsh 
Feminism,1615645812,The answers by feminists to the questions often teach me things and make me rethink my stance Just like in all of reddit the real gold is in the comments 
Feminism,1615645811,How dare you assume anything about my friendship You don t know me Sorry if we dont sit around and talk about feminism for  years You obviously are taking some of what I say and not listening to the rest I explained why I want to ask Your right telling him after the fact is a bad choice of words I have since changed my mind on that I am not dodging anything What I m aiming at is to open up the conversation on his misogyny and toxic masculinity
Feminism,1615669266,i mixed up the links they were the other way around i also missed the page   stastistics which are a lot closer but in the UN report   is never mentioned and was just unsure where it had came from
Feminism,1615669039,Yeah I m sorry but the report isn t really all that  new for any femme person existing in public spaces I know all that stuff because I ve lived it It s great to see it on paper but it s literally all things women and feminism in particular have been demanding for ages
Feminism,1615669001,My anecdotal evidence and that of my friends would strongly support the high number of     I know it may look shockingly high but this just shows how wide spread this problem is 
Feminism,1615668991,just the way the artical is writen is taking somthing away from the stastitic  lying  was probbably a poor way of putting it
Feminism,1615668903,   its definitely way too many and I think it s a real issue id highly recommend reading the full un report its really interesting and talks about some suggestions  to fix the issue
Feminism,1615668683,What are you talking about The second paragraph in the article you claim says    says  gt Among women aged          said they had been sexually harassed while    of women of all ages said they had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces I don t get your problem 
Feminism,1615668403,If you have any follow up questions I ll try my best to answer   
Feminism,1615668368,I have to say is    that much better tho Like   sure things have to be reported accurately and if it s faulty that should be corrected  But    is still way too many people
Feminism,1615668365,I m with your ex MIL on this one It seems like you re trying to understand the idea so I ll explain it in a little more detail Breasts are not inherently sexual Why The only function of breasts is to feed babies They are often erogenous zones yes but so are ears and no one asks people to cover up their ears If you go to other countries  ex certain tribes in Africa women walk around topless and it s normal The only reason boys think they re  magical is because they are seen as taboo due to sexualization by men Also the idea of  exposing children to breasts doesn t make sense Most children breastfeed Again this goes back to the cultural taboo 
Feminism,1615668308,I am not saying this to be unkind but do you realise how hilarious it is that you  won t somebody think of the childrened women s breasts when they are literally for feeding children and most of us spend a significant portion of our early years with our faces attached to women s bare nappies 
Feminism,1615668091,I didn t write the articles so   I don t know Who are you accusing of lying 
Feminism,1615668084,I think the problem here is not the existence of absolute consent but the lack loss of trust between you and your wife And you re trying to address this by going into some elevated philosophical questioning instead of addressing the root cause of the problem Why does your wife doesn t want to have sex with you anymore  Maybe it s on you maybe it s on her it s probably both but nobody here can answer that for you What happened  What changed  What didn t  Why  Maybe she doesn t desire you anymore maybe she s not satisfied with you can you accept those thoughts  This subreddit is not your personnal therapist and that s what you need Also forcing somebody to do something they don t want to by scheduling it regularly and expecting them to enjoy it is the opposite of a solution 
Feminism,1615667583,Yes I see that now That makes much more sense Apologizes 
Feminism,1615666898,As I explained somewhere else in the thread we give the term  separatism a broader meaning 
Feminism,1615666839,Alright I ve decided to ask about the concept of  punching up vs punching down  A person of a priviliged group say men cannot make jokes about people of a oppressed group say women However the reverse is acceptable So when a privileged person is made fun of by an oppressed person they cannot make a joke about the oppressed in response  I admit this seems unfair to me as I didn t choose to be born in a priviliged group and I didn t choose to take on this role I m just supposed to take it and I can t do anything in response This probably also relates to my fragility 
Feminism,1615666780,I don t believe there is a spectrum of consent  There is a spectrum of  activities you can consent to and there is a spectrum of  clarity of communication  non verbal vs  OK vs  here is exactly what I do and do not want  But consent is either yes or no  It s either there or it isn t If it s not clear consent then you assume there is no consent Which is why it s not considered consent if the person is intoxicated or a minor Maybe under other circumstances they would still say yes but you can t know that so you have to treat it as a no It sounds like you objected to the lack of intimacy and connection because you want your wife to be enthusiastic   which is certainly reasonable And maybe she went along with your statement because she was relieved not to feel obligated But I don t think you ever had an issue of consent She consented however grudgingly I think you had more of a relationship issue 
Feminism,1615666116,Fair enough but the way OP phrased the question it sounds like  who did something wrong  and that was definitely her 
Feminism,1615666023,Cheating is a betrayal of trust However the boyfriend appears to have forgiven the girlfriend for that betrayal  They have come to a personal arrangement is none of anyone else s business 
Feminism,1615665890,I wouldn t say she is a bad person She made at least one bad choice but people are bigger than their worst moment 
Feminism,1615665733,Thanks this is one of the better explanations I ve seen 
Feminism,1615665690, The word  cheat was used so this is not a consensual scenario  initially  
Feminism,1615665319,I have done my own research Patriarchy was not created by men It was first established in smaller tribal units and men became dominant figures because of their physical superiority  in a world built on violence the more physical beings took hold of leadership  Patriarchal ideas were created and reasserted by men throughout history particularly in relation to religion  I also don t think the patriarchal system was designed to oppress women  as many academics agree It was a system designed so that every one in society was deemed to have a  proper place I m not saying that this was the right thing to do at all that s just the idea behind it I also do think the system has oppressed women but I don t think the initial intention of it was to suppress women  In terms of patriarchy today I m not entirely sure it exists There are ideas and beliefs that circulate that could exist under patriarchal structures but patriarchy doesn t really exist as a system nowadays in my opinion I know that you can say rape culture the wage gap etc are examples that  prove the existences patriarchal system but they just aren t Men are more often victims of violent crime more men are incarcerated most of the victims of war are men most people that are homeless are men and it can even be argued that men are more persecuted and disproportionately discriminated against in many things such as scholarships or job hiring Even in terms of economic dominance those in the very top are a group of extremely successful men that in no way represent men as a whole I don t think the sexist opinions of a minority men are sufficient to explain the existence of a patriarchy So yeah I sort of have done a bit of research I just asked for your own definition and you got defensive about it   
Feminism,1615665278,This is an interesting article It effectively argues men should be silent and to the side I wouldn t say it endorses separatism or men not calling themselves feminist  Still a good article though 
Feminism,1615664293,Enthusiastic consent exists just fine but it requires that you have a trust relationship so you and trust what they say and express You don t have that trust right now in fact you sound like you are having a trust crisis Anyone could lie to you about anything so how can you possibly trust their consent  I had one of those recently and it was rough That s definitely something to take up in therapy 
Feminism,1615664244,I would rather get men to not sexually assault and rape us It s funny how we even have to ask and then the ones that are  not all men can t even see that this isn t our problem to fix It s happening  to us  Do you want the world to be a fairer better world Then this is what is happening to all women around you Because of men Do something 
Feminism,1615664218,Oh yeah definitely I m not socially inept to the point where I thought it was a good idea I m just socially inept to the point I literally didn t know what else I could say 
Feminism,1615662596,Well your post ist primary example Why does a group call itself  Men s Right s Activist when they don t do anything to help vulnerable men but are exclusively ranting about mean feminists doing nothing Feminists acknowledge that many men are vulnerable and they are supporting gay men depressed men trans men assaulted men    Women s shelters exist because women volunteer donate and lobby for them They also exist because women usually don t own the home or can t pay the rent to throw their abusive partner out Nobody stops men to do the same Considering the wealth and power men hold overall this should be easy I wouldn t be surprised if there are more feminists knowing that there is an  International men s day and when it is than MRAs 
Feminism,1615662405,I think its bad He finds lesbian sex hot and thats the only reason he s allowing this There s a reason she cheated likely problems in the relationship which this isnt solving Cheating isnt right I feel in a good relationship if there are problems you try and solve them instead of going outside the relationship and if it cant work then end the relationship I know abuse exists but I believe in trying to get out before doing cheating 
Feminism,1615662269,So you are quite happy to obstruct a harmless paternity test so you can dodge the consequences of your infidelity 
Feminism,1615660808,Is there consent or is there lying Is there manipulation or enthusiasm That s pretty much it 
Feminism,1615660277,Cheating is complicated there are gray areas and various circumstances People will attack people for cheating so quickly  Not saying I m better or whatnot but it s something that should be heard out as to why Sadly   a lot of women have died when men found out the women found loving elsewhere And folks still attack those who are murdered just because they were in an affair  The boyfriend   it seems like hr s trying to control her sexuality by  allowing her only to sleep with women while being with him so that s not cool I see why she cheated 
Feminism,1615660268,Hang on what do you mean by  women being expected to do all the work for dudes   Can you explain please Thanks 
Feminism,1615660090,I have given some thought to the matter yes as most feminists in my continent have If you are interested in the Latin American perspective on this matter  this article offers a pretty good summary   
Feminism,1615660070,I think it s less about seeing that relationship as invalid non threatening and more about not seeing it as direct competition the same way he would someone of the same sex because when his gf sleeps with another woman his sexual role isn t being taken as sex with a woman is different from sex with a man meanwhile if she were to sleep with a man that would elicit more jealousy as there would be a greater fear of her replacing him with a  more preferable penis wielder a fear which isn t there with the woman  I m assuming these people are cis because I just don t think this exact situation would form the same way if any of them were trans speaking as a trans person who has been cheated on by my former trans partner 
Feminism,1615660005,I mean ya the women is a cheater and the boyfriend is gross for fetishizing bisexual women and wlw relationships but no harm no foul I suppose 
Feminism,1615659740,I can see how you would perceive it that way but to me it s more like men don t view women as a threat to their specific role in the relationship particularly sexually with a man they re concerned that that man will fulfill his own role better for her than he can but with the woman he views it as something different  which he s not exactly wrong about and therefore isn t as threatened because he doesn t feel directly replaced in the same he would if she were having sex with someone more like him 
Feminism,1615659587,I don t think men who are only okay with their gf sleeping with women instead of other men are inherently devaluing sex between women it s moreso that when their gf sleeps with another woman he doesn t feel that his specific role of penis wielder is being replaced she may be sleeping with someone else but she isn t riding someone else s dick  unless it s a trans girl in which case I suppose she might be  
Feminism,1615659579,Seeing as this has been cross posted to another sub with the intent to mock and brigade may I remind everyone that the top level comment rule is still in effect and those participating in brigade will  be immediately banned without discussion 
Feminism,1615659557,Have you considered that asking men no to attend feminist protests and not call them feminism may have and adverse effect on progress  We can t achieve gender equality unless both men and women are part of it Separatism seems like quite a poor solution 
Feminism,1615659461,Wow You cross posted this in another sub in order to mock other users How disappointing Enjoy your ban 
Feminism,1615659167,I disagree Is any animal that hunts to survive a hypocrite If you don t feed your housecat some form of meat I argue you re abusing or neglecting it  Now it s true we as humans have to be more accountable We have the brain power to understand and bodies that could adapt to an all vegan diet Does that obligate us to I don t think so For a few reasons   Best easiest source of necessary protein for the last few thousand years has been meat raised through farming or gathered by hunters We ve built entire cultures around that all over the world You really think it s ethical to go to every culture on earth and tell them to  stop eating the food your culture developed over centuries     if we all just stopped eating meat at this point   can we even imagine what the ecological impact would be What would happen to the tens of thousands of meat and dairy cows Would they all just die Would some survive Would they move into non native environments and cause havoc While I do blame humanity for its egregious interference in nature that doesn t mean I think we can just stop  We need a better less cruel system for sure That s what I m pushing for We need to coexist rather than dominate nature There s plenty of eco friendly ways  meat eaters can still live their lives I don t think it makes them hypocrites at all 
Feminism,1615659031,A lot of the double standards I see people complaining about are actually not the same situation at least not unless you overlook a lot of important factors and take it at the most pared down basic level If I judge a starving person who steals bread differently than a rich person who does the same that doesn t mean I have a double standard in favor of the poor though I m sure there are some rich people who would try to pretend otherwise 
Feminism,1615658985,oh good the privileged white woman is here to keep the latin american women in line I was nearly exposed to a different world view Thank you for saving me from that
Feminism,1615658962,Yes it is well known that meat  especially beef is a very wasteful food source However this is not necessarily true for other animal products such as milk or honey and it does not mean that you have to cut meat consumption entirely to zero either 
Feminism,1615658873,look live and let live the only thing that isn t okay is the cheating  as a woman who dated a bi guy and had talks about non monogamy with him  like I would have been okay with him sleeping with other men  safely but honestly wouldn t have felt as comfortable with him doing that with women  because I am a woman  and its like    well what am I not satisfying there what does she have that I don t But I wouldn t feel that way about a guy cause it s like   I m not in that category we aren t competing at all    like   people analyze shit too much if no one is bothered leave it alone  Don t tell me there s something wrong with the way I feel either okay 
Feminism,1615658787,I think we agree My point is it s the definition according to the people who came up with the word in the first place and generally accepted in and outside of leftist circles The exceptions are just those who don t know about the concept or its history like your example or the people on reddit who claim vegans can t use any oil products cause  a fraction of it comes from dinosaurs

Feminism,1615658528,We should let innocent beings suffer and stay quiet about it just because some people get their feelings hurt Got it 
Feminism,1615658373,A concept of absolute consent would imply that once given it could never be revoked You are correct that such a thing does not exist  there is not any scenario where someone before engaging in sexual or other activity with you could consent and be guaranteed to  never change their mind or their feelings about whatever occurs afterwards  whether there are subsequent sexual encounters the relationship progresses over time  or does not  or the own individuals feelings about the context in which they gave consent can be guaranteed not to change Your experiences as difficult and unfortunate as they are do not render whole cloth the  practice of asking or offering consent in itself meaningless or relevant however  Relationships are made up of many different components Along with sexual commitments  which should include and require consent   there are other commitments you make in regards to open and honest communication to sharing and honouring each other boundaries   etc etc It sounds like your marriage  and the relationship and commitments with your spouse began breaking down some time ago The primary issue between you and your wife is not a lack of enthusiastic consent in regards to sex with your partner scheduled or unscheduled  that is just the particular way the other ways your marriage has already lost trust respect and commitment manifesting  As to how can two people ever trust each other Relationships are about risk  you might mitigate risk by taking other actions outside of sex to build and affirm trust  like communicating offering reciprocity in aid and support etc But it s a fundamental part of the human condition that you can t ever truly know have power over or surety in regards to another person It sounds like you have some pre existing issues with trust in relationships and that your current relationship is also doing harm to your sense of confidence in both yourself and others  I cannot recommend getting solo therapy to deal with those issues with people who are trained to do so enough

Feminism,1615657857,I m not the commenter but have been learning more about nonmonogamy and grew up queer in a conservative home and city for the majority of my life  I think the issue the commenter above is talking about is that the man in the relationship is the one allowing his partner to only be with other women and this is after she had sex with someone else without his prior consent  cheating  This dynamic is not healthy Healthy relationships and partners are supposed to work as a team not have one snatch control while the other isn t looking or assert dominance to get control The need for control is a red flag that the relationship can get toxic and that s without exploring alternatives to monogamy It happens on queer spaces too and the perpetrator is significantly more likely to be a man even then Now in a relationship where a an mspec person wants to explore and grow in their sexuality if both parties agree on what the boundaries are and safety practices then it can be very rewarding It takes a lot of open communication scheduling and consideration  I recommend reading the Ethical Slut not just if you re curious about stepping outside of monogamy but also to get a different perspective and insight on relationships and sex 
Feminism,1615657646, gt is there any evidence that something like this has ever actually happened 
Feminism,1615657300,The society was created by a leftist circle and I promise you it is the definition most vegan circles use Maybe not the definition anti vegan circles use though which is really common in leftist spaces   amp  x   B The definition is popular so that white women on reddit don t use indigenous women  like me as an excuse for why they themselves can t go vegan 
Feminism,1615657105,Sure in the same way you can be a racist and still be a feminist Guess that s why intersectional feminism exists huh 
Feminism,1615656591,Yup Amino acids are very easy to get Your body actually stores excess to combine when it needs it so its very hard to be deficient Because literally all plants have all amino acids as long as you don t starve yourself or only eat bananas or something you ll always get enough 
Feminism,1615656532, gt In my opinion your responses epitomise everything that is wrong about these discussions You and many other feminists are constantly going back to labelling every opinion on this topic as just a  notallmen post However as I have explained many times That because literally that was your post about  gt I am concerned about victims of sexual harassment and I believe that is the fundamental issue at hand But people use this as a pretext for the shaming of others for reasons not related to sexual harassment When   gt Also how is the generalisations about race women different to generalisations about men They are all concerned with a victim perpetrator relationship That s because of power dynamics These statements coming from women and feminists about men have very different impacts and meanings due to that and the context of them is very different than compared to a man saying that about women 
Feminism,1615656435,That is something that wouldn t fly where I live  W Coast of United States  at least not in the major cities They would have to include trans people as well  My dad s gym in the suburbs used to have a   women s only area which was dirty and only included a few pieces of equipment I still used it for the stretching area which didn t exist in the main part of the gym but I felt like a  nd class citizen Ugh My biggest pet peeve about some gyms is when they do not have a dedicated stretching area or they have one but they also store other equipment in there like medicine balls I think many people of any gender would appreciate a space where they can get away from loud talking and grunting  But to your original question a women and trans only time might be complicated because there is no particular time that they work out as opposed to when men do Someone will always be upset because they can not go at the time that is convenient

Feminism,1615655975,Large scale agricultural definitely has issues but I think its misleading to imply veganism is equal in harm than non veganism in that regard  Most of our farmland and crops are grown to feed livestock   Veganism would actually reduce our amount of agriculture needed From Oxford  Specifically plant based diets reduce food s emissions by up to    depending where you live This reduction is not just in greenhouse gas emissions but also acidifying and eutrophying emissions which degrade terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems Freshwater withdrawals also fall by a quarter Perhaps most staggeringly we would require     billion hectares      less farmland  This would take pressure off the world s tropical forests and release land back to nature  says Joseph Poore     
Feminism,1615655965,Also please define what you think  patriarchy and how that exists This is also something I am interested in 
Feminism,1615655874,All men are not complicit in rape All white people are not complicit in white supremacy These comments are the exact same phraseology used by islamaphobes and racists and it is disgusting And if you had read the point I made about actually understanding my argument you would know that I don t want you to say  some men please stop raping us  I m fine with you guys fearing men as a whole What I don t want you to do is to go further in your comments about men in issues not linked to sexual harassment I e by calling men assholes saying we have fragile egos you are using the discussion on sexual harassment to make derogatory comments about all men for no reason whatsoever It s blatantly wrong And don t make this into a thing of me  policing women s speech  I m trying to ask for people to stop targeting and belittling others for things not linked to sexual harassment It s called asking people to stop being dicks and to start being careful in how they define others 
Feminism,1615655872,Thank you for the input I like to hear opinions of people with experiences other than mine so I appreciate you talking the time to explain  I can definitely see how this could be harmful to the other person  the one not in the couple and could come off as using them for the experience
Feminism,1615655845,Don t you think there s a big difference between a hard and fast curfew suggested by a lawmaker vs concerned people suggesting staying home for people who are scared It is absolutely not normalized to punish women for not staying inside after a certain time and that s what a curfew is 
Feminism,1615655673,The way I see it veganism is a choice Good on you But so long as we have cats and dogs as pets there s gonna be animal exploitation They need meats in their diet and not giving them what they need would also be abuse Now humans are indeed omnivorous and could survive and maybe even thrive on a vegan diet but that s never gonna be the norm By all means keep pushing it s a noble enough goal but it s not so simple as  stop farming animals  I don t agree with any big business meat factories I think if we invested more in individual farms we could grass feed healthier happier animals I also think it s possible to eat an animal and still show respect and compassion  I m kind of biased though Close friend of mine growing up was from a sect of Hinduism called Jainism They re vegan by religion But he never said to me  you and your lifestyle are wrong  But then I met some vegans in college Suffice it to say they soured me on the group  We re all products of the world we were born into Not being a vegan doesn t make anyone bad That s not to say veganism is bad but seriously stay outta my food I ve got my own beliefs 
Feminism,1615685571,This is why realizing I was bi after I came out as trans was tough for me I was polyamorous long before but I really didn t want to just use someone for testing especially as being demi would mean I d be basically risking friendships It worked out with someone who turned into an FWB but it really had me worried for a while 
Feminism,1615685564,What makes someone a good person in this instance Someone who chooses to act in good faith to help a person feel safe when they do not or someone who chooses to do nothing when they could do something that costs them literally nothing to help another person feel more safe in an unsafe world 
Feminism,1615685502,Isn t the function of breast feeding inherently sexual Like it s part of the reproductive process 
Feminism,1615685409,  Breasts are not inherently sexual Why The only function of breasts is to feed babies    Are you even a girl 
Feminism,1615685366,Every woman has an experience of being harassed by men Many experience this starting in childhood Women are socialized to experience this fear because of the high rates of sexual assault of which women are the primary targets Your friend is stuck in a victimization olympics with this argument of who has it worse and that misses the point If your friend does not care about women feeling safe what does that tell you about the character of your friend Is that really someone you want to call a friend Someone so devoid of compassion and empathy Who you associate with is a reflection of you and he is actively encouraging you to join him in that 
Feminism,1615685077,It s difficult to say without knowing him myself but it sounds like he doesn t feel like he should take responsibility for something that isn t his fault 
Feminism,1615684998,Ok  But does perceived safety match actual safety I think that s what he s trying to get at Like walking at night is safer as a woman than for a man yet women tend to report more fear Similar to how driving is more dangerous than flying but people are more scared of flying  Idk it s feels like he made a good point and idk how to respond 
Feminism,1615684871,When it comes to violent crime  he s absolutely right      gt According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics males experienced higher victimization rates than females for all types of violent crime except rape or other sexual assault Also the male on male crime rebuttal that I gave when he pointed that out seems to be problematic  But it just seems like common courtesy and doing nothing has the same effect 
Feminism,1615684762,I couldn t find the exact study but  there are statistics that show that men are more likely to be victims of violent crime    barring sexual assault  I ve heard people argue that this may be due to a false sense of security and not being socialized to expect threats literally everywhere they go like we do  
Feminism,1615684660,I d say he s a good person and has plenty of empathy But he did point out that feeling safe is not the same as actually being safe and I was kinda stumped by that distinction  I guess his point is as long as I m not harassing her she s safe I m not responsible for making her  feel safe 
Feminism,1615684573,I do it without giving much thought It s like holding the door open for someone It s just polite  But his question really stumped me because if I did nothing the person I m trying to make feel safe would still be just as safe 
Feminism,1615684481,That s still  no reason to have men locked up based on nothing more than    She said    We have a justice system built on the foundation of  Innocent until proven guilty for a reason   No one should  ever be sentenced for  any crime unless there s some kind of evidence Sometimes that evidence can be a video tape sometimes it can be DNA sometimes it can be impartial witnesses   But it should  never be the accusation alone that sees someone found guilty in a court of law

Feminism,1615683862, gt For example gently kissing someones neck or ears or caressing someones can cause sexual arousal Well you don t cover your neck ears or lips when you go to the pool do you 
Feminism,1615683832, gt In response he asked me why should I care if women feel safe I dunno has he tried being a good person with actual empathy 
Feminism,1615683765,I wonder do you still not know why you do it Is it because you want to look polite or because you want to give others a feeling you would like to receive yourself Safety  Everyone has something they re afraid of so if it was in someone else s power to not enhance that fear in you by going slightly out of their way wouldn t you want them to Do unto others and all that lol
Feminism,1615683566,I mean it s true You don t  need to do anything But that doesn t mean that doing it isn t the considerate thing to do in the social milieu we live in The real question should be  why not What tangible harm does it bring anyone who chooses to do this 
Feminism,1615683429,From what I know it was originally used by black women to call out racist behaviour However it has been co opted by the misogynists to be a general derogatory term to be dumped on any woman who chooses to stand up for anything and isn t completely amiable in every way possible  so yes current mainstream usage is rather sexist 
Feminism,1615683058,I don t know if this really applies in social situations though OP didn t mention anything about working or applying yourself 
Feminism,1615682837,There are some obvious differences but not so much with the underlying feelings involved more so the way that things are built around us to drive fear into us and the way society responds as well as the specific ways in which people are affected black people don t come out of the closet so there is no hiding 
Feminism,1615682719,It s different due to the hate motivation I believe Both discriminate something that it s inherent of a group of people Both homophobes and racists are motivated by hatred and superiority complex 
Feminism,1615682628,Maybe it s like kiwi and bananas are different but they are both fruit Homophobia and racism are different flavors but at their base they are the same thing Hate ignorance and fear   So great to self examine I am trying to make sure I don t have any weird complexes as well 
Feminism,1615682575, gt He also pointed out that women are socialized to fear men even though it s statistically safer to be a woman than a man I d love to know how being a woman in this fucking society is safer than being a man  You answer appropriately It s common courtesy and common sense to not make people uncomfortable you can t teach him how to be a fucking decent person Some men clearly lack a heart and a brain 
Feminism,1615682381,Because every adult should feel safe going outside after dark and atm with the amount of rapes and assaults that go on against women they don t We really need to work on making town centres feel safe It s a psychological thing about showing you re not a threat 
Feminism,1615682260,I have a problem with it when it becomes a label that is given to any woman who says something a guy disagrees with in order to cast her as uptight or narrow minded which I have seen That s bullshit My understanding is that  Karen is not about all women it s about white women It fits into the ideas of Becky and Miss Anne and can be a commentary on white women using their relatively high ranking in the  white supremacist  patriarchy to abuse and oppress anyone who is not also a white woman or man Is this anti feminist I think that s a discussion that can t happen without examining the intersectionality of the brand of feminism in question There s an opportunity for a deeper discussion here as long as the term  Karen isn t just used as another bludgeon to silence women which I would agree is an anti feminist phenomenon 
Feminism,1615682236,That s a hard question to answer People in general are both good and bad Even the nicest person I know has been bad in situations I m a guy myself and if I really had to pick one gender for being nice over the other I d say women are nicer than men in general but there are both nice and bad people on both sides 
Feminism,1615682063,Pretty much it I try to avoid people especially at night while I m walking There s two reasons one is because I m socially anxious myself and the second is I myself look like a thug and I know people who don t know me feel scared when walking anywhere close to me I usually walk quite fast and it s not a big issue for me to just avoid people in general and go a little bit out of my way to keep distance between them and me Their perception of me can t change but then again they have every right to not feel safe in the fucked up world we live in 
Feminism,1615681973,I also couldn t agree more that whatever the status of breasts sexuality those attracted to breasts have no reason not to control themselves and not make such a big deal of it for Pete s sake I was a big boobed teen and getting  in those cases Men looking at my hoodie covered chest during every interaction is absolutely absurd To this day I dress in men s clothes because of societal body issues and it makes me furious now as an adult that we as a society would continue to cause those feelings whoever s fault it may be 
Feminism,1615681922, gt  Not exactly attractive overweight looks like your typical loser dude on the sofa and he doesn t even act that well  I m not that familiar with his work but I have seen him in publicity photos He seems to look like an average middle aged guy working a sedentary profession I think it s a bit harsh to call him a  typical loser dude  unless you consider the average guy to be a loser 
Feminism,1615681774,I d like to add that it s less helpful to focus on who is a bad person and in fact that feminism main goal is not deciding who is bad but what social structures exist to uphold patriarchy and who is harmed by it It gets painted as an attack and as men are bad and that s not really the story There are some excellent responses to your question in the thread 
Feminism,1615681389,I m definitely not saying men don t sexualize breasts But from my perspective I would say the people who sexualize breasts the most are the women I know  I m absolutely not saying that when a woman tries to look attractive in whatever way that she s automatically doing it for other people but of all the people I know the Ladies I know are the ones figuring out ways to make their breasts a sexy feature explicitly for others Contouring push up bras bra inserts water bras and actual breast surgeries that are cosmetic only  Again I don t think there is a single thing wrong if women want to do this but I do think that the people continuing and perpetuating the sexualization of breasts in the practical sense is SEEMINGLY women  I mean look at Victoria s Secret not much diversity and really not much size inclusion and I have only ever seen women in there as I walk by I don t have a comprehensive male perspective on this and I would definitely love it     On the subject of their practicality for breastfeeding only I believe human women are the only mammals that have very visible breasts outside of when they are lactating I m not sure how that can be used in arguments but it s a very very interesting subject 
Feminism,1615681065,I have   no clue what your point is You re saying that men sexualising breasts isnt the reason we can t be topless And then go on to make the point that the  real reason we can t be topless   is because young boys will sexualise our breasts     So you re making every single woman adapt their actions for the sake of a few immature boys who havent been taught to act appropriately around female breasts Do you not think that maybe allowing women to have their breasts out in public would work towards desexualising and normalising them so that boys don t see them as  magical  because they aren t magical they re ordinary secondary sex characteristics like facial hair  Also   idk where you live but in europe it s normal for both men and women to sunbathe topless and no one bats an eyelid 
Feminism,1615680674,Abridged origin In the roaring    s after WW and the spread of Ford s Model T car driving changed from a luxury to something increasingly accessible to the middle class When wealthy men or women displayed their wealth by owning a car that was considered fine When a middle class man went to work in his car that was considered fine But a middle class woman discovering new freedom in her car Can t have that that will both lower the prestige of car ownership and challenge the social norm of the stay at home wife And so those who didn t want either of the above but still wanted men to keep buying cars started this myth that women can t drive Even though women had been driving just fine before and after that 
Feminism,1615680658,i agree that person who i had in mind when i was typing this question seems to be very sensitive and unpleasant to be around 
Feminism,1615679841,I suppose as someone who spent a whole lot of my life predominantly around women I find them more approachable but I can t make any claims to niceness and virtue No individual human being can make that sort of judgement call IMO 
Feminism,1615679282,You want  little to do with women yet here you are offering your opinion in a sub about women s rights Huh  No need to reply to this comment I m a woman so you probably don t want to interact anyway right

Feminism,1615677423,That s just plain wrong there are two genders It s called biology 
Feminism,1615676193,I thought this was in r askphilosophy when I first saw it This is the sort of thought experiment that s often used to tease out moral intuitions about consequentialism   specifically whether the girlfriend s  intentions matter in making a moral judgment about her actions or only their  in this case positive consequences or whether you think it is a problem that that she has benefitted from   moral luck    Personally I d say that her initial action of cheating was unethical for sure I think the boyfriend s differential attitude to her having extra relationship sex with women vs men is absolutely borne of societal misogyny but also his feelings are still his feelings If both of them are happy with the arrangement and she s being kind and caring to women she s seeing  and not trying to impose restrictions on who  they sleep with  I think the solution they come to is fine

Feminism,1615674497,it really varies from feminist to feminist what they call it exactly for me it s bringing the patriarchy down
Feminism,1615674175,The woman is in my opinion the offender here Whilst the hypothetical guy didn t end up minding and let her do it again she still was unfaithful and should ve either not been unfaithful or discussed having something of an open relationship beforehand 
Feminism,1615673865,Wait aren t we saying the same thing Because I agree with you     
Feminism,1615673602,I think you two need to work on restoring trust and respect for each other before you worry about having sex Without trust there is no foundation to build a healthy relationship on 
Feminism,1615673587, gt dismatling the patriarchy and  gt harmony between the sexes are the same thing Not an either or 
Feminism,1615673437,I would disagree with this  Enthusiastic consent exists just fine but it s meant for new couples as a way to be ultra aware that they re not coercing or taking advantage of the other party  Once a relationship is well established sex does not need to have     enthusiastic consent all the time  But at that point you should have a level of communication and trust where you can be certain if they truly are consenting or not  If that level of trust is not there for you OP then yeah you should be revoking your own consent until it s back and you can be confident of her intentions The rest of it is more of a philosophical question than a feminist one   OP got a little lost in their own head I think and is really asking whether or not it s possible to completely trust someone to ever be completely honest with you  That s an understandable question too but I d rather keep ideas on consent specifically practical rather than philosophical 
Feminism,1615672857,Who made you video games gatekeeper dumbass    Also the only men who whine about women playing video games and harass them in game generally tend to be super bad at it themselves       Also galaxy brain thinking at equating FPS to video games  per se

Feminism,1615672215,a The sexualisation is not intrinsic to body parts Note that in the same societies different parts get sexualised at different times and within different subcultures There are cultures where nudity and toplessness are completely normalised   the Victorians found ankles very arousing  and some people find feet arousing and I find nudity completely not arousing    b If what is sexually arousing is defined by whether you can give yourself certain neural responses then since people can get themselves off orgasms wouldn t be sexual or arousing  this absurdity should make you see the flaw in your logic     c Men sexualising breasts and having that institutionalised is  exactly why I cannot go topless I didn t have tits before I transitioned and now I do and them making them sexual and obscene is why I risk arrest in many parts of the world  They re just tits in most contexts 
Feminism,1615671718,A fascinating link to make is noticing that most cultures that made being topless illegal didn t do so until a religion enforced it   Another counterpoint a country that has communal public bathing Japan Women bathe naked with children Entire families bathe naked together There s nothing inherently sexual about the body it s about how you behave with your body or how others project their feelings about your body I grew up with family members frequently topless and I certainly was not traumatized by it Part of objectification is the mystification of it Ooo what s under the ladies blouse   Mystical magical breasts that we might get to touch if we get blessed What wondrous sights hidden from view When in reality as someone who goes to a women s only nude spa regularly breasts are pretty boring And I m sexually attracted to women They re just lumps of fat on the front of our chests They re lovely to play with but they re also no mystery Maybe young boys shouldn t be so ignorant of human biology 
Feminism,1615671578,No   I could imagine that feminist movements might become more demanding in the future and yes many women are angry at women who don t support women but this has never led to violence towards them 
Feminism,1615671540,If we grew up in an environment where breast aren t considered sexual and were out as much as male breast boys wouldn t freak out at a sight of female nipple Proof  look at countries where women s breast aren t a taboo 
Feminism,1615671250,I feel like the number is too low and the actual number is      A number of women are like me five years ago who though  come on I wasn t sexually harassed ever Boss demanding sex is sexual harassment I never experiences anything like that  What I did experience were men following me men exposing their genitalia men groping me on public transport men asking   year old me inappropriate questions men who were authority figures hugging me way too long and inappropriately men catcalling me men offering   year old me in school uniform a ride men kissing me without consent when I went to throw up on a train because I drank too much  I have multiple cases of full blown sexual assault yet my memory registered it as not a big deal and hilarious yet humiliating adventure  I think the truth is that     of women were sexually harassed and     of women were sexually assaulted I can t make up a situation where a woman isn t sexually harassed or assaulted even once in her entire life Maybe some wild child who lives with wolves and never seen people but I doubt she will be a participant in this questionnaire 
Feminism,1615670904,BDSM is an interesting one to explore there depending on what the partner was seeking it could easily be seen as entirely separate from their relationship or overlapping in ways that cross into the parts they feel should remain exclusive
Feminism,1615670830,the girlfriend didnt cheat because they guy gave her consent to be with the other girl the boyfriend is in the wrong for fetishising them 
Feminism,1615670628,The thing about breasts is that they re sexualized on women but they can be sexual for men to The only thing about a bigger chest on a woman is it is seen as scandelous Men are the ones who put this law into effect that women should hide their breasts and people don t teach children that breasts on women are normal If children are exposed to something from a young age that becomes their normal  There are some communities around the world that don t sexualize women s breasts and it is completely normal for them to go topless You have to look at certain things that men can do that women can t Taking off their shirt in a public setting being one of them 
Feminism,1615670565,Here s an exercise can you think of any part of your body that is treated the way we treat breasts  We don t usually choose to have breasts and they don t only show up when we re aroused When I m walking down the street going to work or at a beach with my kid or nursing a baby I m not being sexually suggestive Female bodies are not responsible for male reactions full stop men who have sexual thoughts about women are responsible for their own behavior and male children need to learn respect  You can think all the dirty thoughts you want about the breasts around you that s fine But that s a choice you are making I also love women and their bodies sexually  somehow I don t have an issue with nude breasts in public Just like people who menstruate learn to manage those symptoms people with higher testosterone are responsible for managing their own emotions 
Feminism,1615670455,Young boys have to be taught not to  objectivie women but you are basically objectifying women here Okay then 
Feminism,1615670359,Feminism is for equality usually that means getting rid of stereotypes standing up for people when they are wronged and really looking into systems and traditions that are damaging Whatever the outcome is is better than what we ve got now 
Feminism,1615670214,I think all around it s a pretty nasty scenario Firstly with the breaking of trust in a relationship Cheating is something that is important usually if it happens once then it happens again The woman cheating isn t alright but the boyfriend finding out then finding it  hot is pretty messed up too Not only is it fetishizing a relationship between two women It s also pretty clearly stating that he finds a woman less threatening than a man So he sees women s relationships as both  hot and not as valid as that of a man and woman Not to mention the other woman stayed when she found out that she was being used as a side partner and being sexualized People can do what they want but that is a whole bundle of issues I don t want anything to do with if it s real Yikes 
Feminism,1615669872,Thanks for responding and the clarity it makes sence It is hard to wrap my head arround it but this is something i can work with I really apreciate it 
Feminism,1615669819,The fundamentals of consent are broadly   Capacity of the person giving consent the person should be of sound mind not drunk high to the point of no control they should be old enough to give consent and they should be in a physical state to give consent whether verbal or by gestures   The mode of consent while it can be both gestures verbal it s important that the consent is fundamentally express i e given by their own volition it should be complete and not conditional   The consent should be free there should be no coercion manipulation fraud undue influence of power position mistake or misrepresentation in the way consent has been obtained There should be a meeting of the minds so to speak Every person involved should know clearly what is being consented and it should have no such coercive tactics in play making the consent free and absolute Sometimes the conditions can be such that although a person does not expressly say a verbal  no  due to influence power dynamics sexual dynamics personal history trauma etc it does not amount to a  yes either   Enthusiastic consent is term that is basically used to imply that instead of looking for a simple lack of  no there should be a presense of  yes  whether it is verbal or by gestures like positive body language When there is power imbalance coercion etc there will most likely be no express verbal consent and no positive gestural consent via body language emotional display etc While it s true people may not completely trust or even know each other consent on its own has nothing to do their interpersonal relationships history or even future Consent should not be seen has a reflection of people s lives or relationships as a whole consent should be seen as a fundamental part in every single sexual act that any people engage in whether they have known each other for one day or one entire lifetime So yes absolute consent exists 
Feminism,1615669670,They appear to be getting the    from the UN women s website which says   Only   of women aged      said they had not experienced sexual harassment  I can t find this figure after skimming the report but I believe the    figure is from asking women  have you experienced sexual harassment in a   public place   So I m assuming the    figure is from asking women  have you experienced sexual harassment   at all    although I admittedly cannot find this data in their report 
Feminism,1615693149,I see it like this  It seems like the best argument is politeness I care about being polite and putting people around me at a little bit of ease while also balancing my own ability to express and assert myself  I wont change my behavior because I think it s polite He doesn t care about politeness and putting people at ease I don t think that makes him a bad person since he s never actually assault anyone or harmed anyone  But he is my friend so I am a bit biased 
Feminism,1615693109,I m guessing that bison is the  friend from his story he is doing nothing but defending his  friend s bad behavior 
Feminism,1615693072,I think it is misogyny and anti feminist It s clearly aimed at women and it s clearly meant to shut them up There is nothing more patriarchal than shutting up women 
Feminism,1615692956,He IS a danger if he s spreading his bigotry and refusing to treat others as human beings of value What he does makes others justify their own bigotry and ignorance 
Feminism,1615692954,If my friends were in the situation I would stay out of it and not judge them Obviously the cheating woman confessed and the boyfriend forgave her and they are both happy Also I am bisexual and to be honest there is something different about sleeping with a man versus sleeping with a woman as it appeals to different parts of me and my sexuality I m not trying to say that cheating is OK but that instead people may perceive their own sexual experiences with men or women differently and I m not going to claim that the boyfriend is fetishizing because of it 
Feminism,1615692884,Tell me how you see it then because from your comments I think you are making a lot of excuses for him because he s your friend Simply because he s a friend to you doesn t make him a good person You need to be real with yourself on that 
Feminism,1615692747,Nah he s been my best friend since I was like  and we re really really close I ll call him out but dropping is extreme 
Feminism,1615692697,Plus they forget to mention that those men are victims of other men Most crimes against men and women are committed by MEN    Any time I hear someone using that argument it s always used as a justification of that person s bigotry 
Feminism,1615692696,Nobody  at least not in this thread is asking him to apologize 
Feminism,1615692694, gt Yeah I imagine nothing will convince him because he s self centered and isn t a feminist And a lot of women do get professional help that doesn t change the perceived sense of danger especially when we ve been told all our lives to change our behavior to be safe Don t drink too much don t wear revealing clothes don t be out late etc We hear that from childhood on throughout our lives and when women experience violence they are often blamed for it If he can t wrap his brain around that he s probably a lost cause I wouldn t want to be friends with someone like that I think this is an interesting case If we stop telling women to fear men in order to be safe would the fear go away  It seems like the fear is based in perceived extent of harm  fear of escalation violence and impact  rather than the frequency So even if it almost never happened the perceived fear would likely not change Like the driving vs airplane analogy Deaths from driving are more frequent but if you get into a car crash some people might survive An airplane crashes less frequently but when it does it s catastrophic  Sorry if this is an insensitive way of thinking It s just something I m curious about 
Feminism,1615692575,If I m honest he doesn t sound like a nice person He sounds like a person who is good to people he likes He clearly doesn t give a crap about how he affects other people aka women strangers 
Feminism,1615692349,Sounds like your friend is quite the sexist and is unwilling to educate himself about the oppression and discrimination women have had to face he has no empathy to even think of someone else besides himself and people like him  misogynists     Some people will insist on defending their bigotry no matter what and it s not worth the effort His comments like  statistically safer to be a woman than a man is proof of this Most crimes perpetrated against women are by men and most crimes perpetrated against men are by men That s statistically correct Throughout history men have oppressed and made women feel unsafe hell until a couple of decades ago it was still legal to rape your wife and still is legal in some countries Women have so much to be afraid of thanks to men yet your friend feels that as a male he has no responsibility to help rectify the wrongs of the past   Drop this friend he s not worth your time Rather make friends with good people who care about others People who fight against sexism racism homophobia etc This friend of yours is so ignorant and against treating others with kindness just imagine how badly he will treat you when you need help You don t need to keep trash like that around 
Feminism,1615691890,I don t count catcalling as sexual assault either I m certainly not saying catcalling is as bad as mugging My point was that I have no way to know which catcaller will escalate to something more And the original question was about why men should care Catcalling is already unpleasant and disrespectful on its own even if I could be sure that s all it is Things don t have to be life or death to provoke bad feelings and if you have any empathy at all you might care about that 
Feminism,1615691768,You know there exists a kind of bisexuality where one seeks romance from lets say men and sexual feelings from women In this kind of situation it s totally understandable that men are seen as threats because they might replace the husband but women are not because the wife doesn t find women attractive in a romantic way 
Feminism,1615691527,Look up Emmet Till Not too long ago if you were a young Black man who didn t bow his head and look down when passing a white woman you could wind up at the bottom of a river When your very existence makes someone uncomfortable what do you do Just die   Look up the Tulsa race massacre Because white women didn t feel safe  after an alleged r pe by a Black man on a white woman  a whole thriving Black community was bombed and hundreds of people killed their bodies thrown into the river   Why do we fear the man and not those who lynch him 
Feminism,1615691291,Yeah I imagine nothing will convince him because he s self centered and isn t a feminist  And a lot of women do get professional help that doesn t change the perceived sense of danger especially when we ve been told all our lives to change our behavior to be safe Don t drink too much don t wear revealing clothes don t be out late etc We hear that from childhood on throughout our lives and when women experience violence they are often blamed for it  If he can t wrap his brain around that he s probably a lost cause I wouldn t want to be friends with someone like that 
Feminism,1615691225,It s a shit world we live in if men need to start apologizing for perfectly normal and neutral stuff like walking on a street 
Feminism,1615691052,Sexual assault is such a broad category it s not correct to compare everything from catcalling to rape against mugging 
Feminism,1615691005,Other people have already covered that it s the kind and caring thing to do  and if you have to explain why kind and caring and good traits then your friend has serious issues but I want to touch on your male privilege  You benefit from being  and presenting as cis men It s this privilege that allows your friend to be so selfish  he genuinely feels he is entitled to live his life like that without actively working towards improving the quality of life for others  By taking action and consciously making space for women to feel safe you are contesting that privilege extending your empathy muscles and showing that you value women s feelings and recognise their reality These are all valuable traits especially because it means you have to go back on the conditioning we receive to isolate men and women  from both themselves and each other   So thank you for taking the time to consider both how women feel and how your presence  as well intentioned as one may be could affect them and or their sense of safety Your friend is being selfish and short sighted and by refusing to take accountability for his privilege he is further contributing to a culture that intimidates and dismisses women 
Feminism,1615690990,The reason people generally write trans women with a space between  trans and  women is that  trans is an adjective describing  women  like saying  tall women or  blonde women  Trans women are women 
Feminism,1615690981,Not only is it common courtesy but there s a ton of studies about how when everyone feels safe and able to share their voice then companies communities thrive It s long and I don t have the sources atm  I m on mobile but it s a pretty interesting argument It s the same reason why I care about the education of the people I ve never met or why third world countries deserve clean water food education and better lives We care about other people because when one of us thrives we all thrive 
Feminism,1615690885,Are you implying that rape and violence are getting more common Source please 
Feminism,1615690702,Oh ok good answer It won t convince him because he believes it not his fault women have this fear He believes that they should seek professional help if they have this fear 
Feminism,1615690672,Did you not frame his view as  why should I care how she feels  
Feminism,1615690650,I said   I   I didn t say a thing about men not being victims of assault such as rape and sexual harassment  I fail to see how men in the daily basis fear rape as women do Fear being sexually harassed and being catcalled as women do Fear being blame for their own assault as women do But although I  fail to see I don t claim it as the ultimate truth 
Feminism,1615690570,Do you only ever do things if they entirely benefit you Do you think the few seconds you re sacrificing add up to anything substantial  Check your phone See if you ve gotten an email or a text That s literally enough time to create significant distance You re gonna do it at some point anyway  When you think about it for a minute it really isn t a big ask So just do it 
Feminism,1615690419,Or you could stop for   seconds to check your phone to let her move ahead which is my husband s move  A few seconds is not a cost and your other comment about it not directly benefitting you makes me wonder what is your intention with it anyway With that statement it sounds like you do this for  nice guy points and not because you genuinely care about the women s perceived sense of safety Maybe that s why you can t come up with a solid response to your friend  amp  x   B At the end of the day we are a community of people To be good people we do things that benefit others not because it benefits us but because it is a good thing to do especially when it costs you nothing or next to nothing  amp  x   B Speaking as a therapist perceived safety is a very real experience that affects mental health Women live in a state of toxic stress and hypervigilance If you can take   seconds to help lessen that you are providing a net positive benefit for your community If you are hung up on yourself then you are selfish 
Feminism,1615690407,Guess you can t really do much with someone who s perspective is  why should I give a fuck about others  
Feminism,1615690297,Lol I think he would disagree  But      I dont think I ll be able to change his mind with any of these arguments
Feminism,1615690244,Men also fear their bodies being violated  Your comment framed it as being  getting groped or raped vs getting robbed and that s a  massive oversimplification of male victimization 
Feminism,1615690185,I can definitely understand that but I m concerned about the fact that he s arguing with you on this As a woman it s not sounding reassuring Lol 
Feminism,1615690098,He s a pretty cool guy But he s pretty goal oriented and focused so doing these things don t really occur to him 
Feminism,1615690050,The stats did not exclude sexual assault and rape It just said that that s the only type of crime that are have higher female victimization than male   gt The part of you pointed sums perfectly the different between being a man and a woman in society  gt Woman fear for their bodies being assaulted groped and raped way more than they care about being robbed I d rather be robbed      times than be groped and abused Your friend clearly lacks knowledge on the context of this data and what they represent The problem is that getting robbed is not the online crime outside of sexual assault and rape So this argument isn t very good 
Feminism,1615690011,Fair enough on the sociopath remark consider it retracted I was debating including it Time and effort to make others feel safe and comfortable is no real cost at all as far as I m concerned 
Feminism,1615689920,Ye not a big fan of throwing around words like that because it demonizes those who are actually diagnosed with sociopathy  He said that it would cost him time and effort to do that he sees no real benefit in doing  Idk don t think I can change his mind
Feminism,1615689880,Margaret Atwood did say she didnt write anything in it that hasnt happened at some point 
Feminism,1615689829,   Your own comment man The link you gave and quoted shows that the stats  excluded sexual assault and rape 
Feminism,1615689821,I suppose that s the more tactful way to put it but I don t have much patience for guys like that Good luck 
Feminism,1615689747,Ok I see But yeah I won t say it s a decent person thing I ll just tell him it s a matter of being nice 
Feminism,1615689745,Whenever I hear arguments in favour of covering up the human body because  insert body part is inherently sexual I think of three things First no body part is inherently sexual even sexual organs They are sexual in a sexual setting but outside of that they are just another body part Is washing your genitals sexual Not unless you make it Peeing Not unless you are a into that and b it s already a sexual situation Is scratching your genitals because they itch sexual Nope sometimes they just itch Teenagers get hardons out of nowhere in public in the middle of the day and that s not even sexual It just happens Puritanical views if the body has reduced them to their sexual function but they are not solely sexual They become sexual Second I think of nudism People are literally fully naked in front of each other all day and it s not a constant orgy and children are not scarred by seeing naked people around them Nudist colonies are only awkward if people make it sexual  i e creeps  Not to say it is impossible for nudism to be problematic but in and of itself being naked isn t even sexual It s hiding bodies that make them so enticing when they are revealed And I m saying that as someone who does not partake in that lifestyle at all And third can men s nipples be sexual They can be A LOT of men like their nipples played with during intimacy yet we don t freak out over men s nipples Ask yourself this question why can men s breasts sometimes be sexual but women s breast are seen as always sexual 
Feminism,1615689706,Your friend sounds kind of sociopathic If you re an empathetic person you consider the well being of others in the shared spaces you occupy It doesn t cost anything to be courteous but it can help others a whole damn lot 
Feminism,1615689700,Eh it s more of a personal thing I guess Crossing the street does cost me things sometimes It takes longer to reach my destination and it gives me a bit of anxiety 
Feminism,1615689610,I mean it doesn t cost  nothing  It costs some time and doesn t entirely benefit me when I do it but it seems polite 
Feminism,1615689550,He s a nice person for the most part but he s not really privy to every social cue I like him and this doesn t particularly do much to his character for me  I don t think he cares much about the victim hood olympics as you say I think it s more about not doing anything that would inconvenience himself because he s not inherently a danger  or at least he doesn t see himself that way  
Feminism,1615689348,Violent crime is an assault against bodily autonomy This includes armed robbery assault battery rape murder etc I m not sure this argument holds much water
Feminism,1615689296,Harmony and Equality between the sexes is it for me but you cant do that without dismantling the patriarchy 
Feminism,1615689269,I think the difference is that stalking is an intentional invasion of privacy  or at least an attempt at one which inherently makes the other person unsafe My friend was talking about not changing his behavior in public and inconveniencing himself to make women feel safer 
Feminism,1615689199,You just care because you re not an asshole It s really that simple Yes men are more likely to be murdered but are less likely to be sexually assaulted and in all cases men are more likely to be perpetrators than women and we re less physically capable of dealing with that situation Just tell him it s a matter of being a decent person 
Feminism,1615689124,I think I agree with this sentiment It s just a politeness thing and isn t really doing any harm to anyone else 
Feminism,1615689078,Yes they are This is only a continuous debate with people who hold ignorant views and lack of understanding about transgender folks 
Feminism,1615688991, gt Are you gonna care more for this random dude Be worried about his safety on the of chance a muging happens Are you gonna watch over him to make sure he is not distracted and warn him of any impending attacks or anything like that Or are you most likely gonna continue on your way If I feel safe enough to speak if something falls off of his pockets I ll more likely warn In the reality I ll acknowledge his consideration in my head and appreciate the effort he made to make me feel less endangered   gt Conversely if OPs friend was walking behind you literally not giving a fuck about you and if you notice a man with a knife going to rush him are you saying that you wouldn t even try to warn him and just run away If you do that notice how immediate moraly speaking you loose out on the  deserve to feel safe status If not giving a fuck about me is not getting close to me in a creepy way and minding his business then he s doing fine If anyone was gonna be attacked in front of me regardless I d probably scream to warn it  I think you re stretching what consideration is this context  I said if OP s friend showed lack of empathy and consideration for my fear I d be inconsiderate to him as a friend colleague I won t give a fuck anymore about how he s feeling what he s dealing with etc This is the scenario I made 
Feminism,1615688908,Just as safe but also less anxious and afraid which to me is worth at least something 
Feminism,1615688660,It s literally not that much of an inconvenience for you to walk across the road to make a women feel a little more safer Even if you know you re not going to do something to her she doesn t it s not that difficult to just make her feel a little more safe Even if you don t feel like  accommodating for someone else s needs it s not like a hard thing to do at all just be a good person brother that s all 
Feminism,1615688656,Next step I d say would be for you to be openly pro feminism to your guy friends If the topic never comes up find a way to bring it up Exemplify and normalize men supporting and believing women 
Feminism,1615688576,Yes I recently showed some other online ignorant this exact context of crime data Men who use this  argument are clearly just hiding their lack of empathy and logical thinking 
Feminism,1615688487, gt I m not implying anything I m saying the obvious    How does that work out in real life You are walking down a street with OP behind you And OP wanting you to feel safe does something ie he talks on his phone to his mom stops to tie shoelaces of his velcro sneakers whatever  Are you gonna care more for this random dude Be worried about his safety on the of chance a muging happens Are you gonna watch over him to make sure he is not distracted and warn him of any impending attacks or anything like that Or are you most likely gonna continue on your way    Conversely if OPs friend was walking behind you literally not giving a fuck about you and if you notice a man with a knife going to rush him are you saying that you wouldn t even try to warn him and just run away If you do that notice how immediate moraly speaking you loose out on the  deserve to feel safe status     gt I don t know about you but I believe that kindness generate kindness AAcknowledged kindness generated kindness Kindness done is general without the beneficent part being aware of the benefactor is pointless if the goal is to receive kindness That s not to say you shouldn t do it but receiving kindness should be the goal Good things should be done because it is right to do so and no other reason     gt If this man was inconsiderate to me when I expressed this fear of walking alone at night I d be inconsiderate to him in return    Oh   so this is a social setting So not the situation at hand of walking around at night 
Feminism,1615688425,Please respect out top level comment rule which states that all top level comments must come from feminists and must reflect a feminist perspective Non feminists may only participate in nested comments Comment this is your last warning 
Feminism,1615688346,Yeah off the top of my head men are more likely to be victims of non sexual crimes and they also are killed at greater rates in war situations  obviously  Women are more likely to be raped sexually assaulted and harassed And also women are more like to be abused and murdered by their spouse Men that use their argument are technically wrong however they are showing themselves to be uneducated in how to appropriately use statistics in a debate Yeah men get killed at a higher rate because of a variety of situations but they are rarely killed because of their gender sex etc The fact that he used this as an excuse is pretty shitty of him in my opinion 
Feminism,1615688264,If I threw a bunch of harmless spiders at a person deathly scared of spiders would they be actually less safe than if I didn t No but everyone would consider me a huge asshole and for good reason And from a purely logical perspective women have a much better reason to be scared 
Feminism,1615687978,I don t think that acknowledging different people fulfilling different sexual roles inherently denotes one of those roles as lesser than another it s just true that there are differences between sex with different kinds of people independent of any value judgement on those differences and I think it s natural for people to be more inclined towards jealousy when they see someone performing a role more similar to theirs Obviously I d ideally rather there be no roles either I m a non binary genderfluid person who was assigned male at birth and is indeed tired of the ways in which society has punished me for not fitting their perceived standards of what someone with my body type should be  act like and I m not trying to impose any such standards on anyone else I m just saying in general this goes for all areas of life it makes sense for people to be more inclined to experience jealousy and resentment towards those who remind them more of themselves in the same way that people are more likely to compare themselves those who work in their own field than someone who works in a different field  It is true that there are differences when having sex with different kinds of people and to me it is valid for people to experience more insecurity over the idea of their partner sleeping with someone who reminds them more of themself than someone who doesn t because in the case of the person who resembles them more there is a greater fear of that person replacing them  I personally know this fear well my ex also trans but was closeted at the time as was I put relentless pressure on me to be a traditionally hyper masculine man and ultimately cheated on me with someone he decided fit this role better who incidentally also assaulted me During this relationship I was justifiably more threatened by his affections towards men than any other gender although my ex was pan because that was the demographic he placed the heaviest emphasis on comparing me to and that being more afraid of get cheated on by someone you perceive as more like yourself doesn t inherently denote any sense of disdain towards those who are more different from yourself 
Feminism,1615687893,I mean that s her personal experience and there s nothing beyond that 
Feminism,1615687869,Yes I am To clarify breasts are great I m a woman and I m bisexual so I enjoy them in different ways Breasts have a lot of uses and they re pretty cool However their only official function is breastfeeding 
Feminism,1615687819,I don t think that acknowledging different people fulfilling different sexual roles inherently denotes one of those roles as lesser than another it s just true that their are differences between sex with different kinds of people independent of any value judgement on those differences and I think it s natural for people to be more inclined towards jealousy when they see someone performing a role more similar to theirs Obviously I d ideally rather there be no roles either I m a non binary genderfluid person who was assigned male at birth and is indeed tired of the ways in which society has punished me for not fitting their perceived standards of what someone with my body type should be  act like and I m not trying to impose any such standards on anyone else I m just saying in general this goes for all areas of life it makes sense for people to be more inclined to experience jealousy and resentment towards those who remind them more of themselves people are more likely to compare themselves those who work in their own field than someone who works in as a different field It is true that there are differences when having sex with different kinds of people and to me it is valid for people to experience more insecurity over the idea of their partner sleeping with someone who reminds them more of themself than someone who doesn t because in the case of the person who resembles them more there is a greater fear of that person replacing them  I personally know this fear well my ex also trans put relentless pressure on me to be a traditionally hyper masculine man and ultimately cheated on me with someone he decided for this role better who incidentally also assaulted me During this relationship I was justifiably more threatened by his affections towards men although my ex was pan because that was the demographic he placed the heaviest emphasis on comparing me to and that being more afraid of get cheated on by someone you perceive as more like yourself doesn t inherently denote any sense of disdain towards those who are different from yourself 
Feminism,1615687756,Rephrase that to why should men care about women or anybody for that matter And statistically everybody is significantly more in danger from men the difference is men have more power over that dynamic 
Feminism,1615687720,Interesting I don t necessarily see your situation as  politeness  It would occur to me as a character trait Given that the person s actual safety is the same if you re doing it because it s the societally expected thing to do then whatever  Do it or don t do it you don t owe anybody anything  If you re not unsafe you shouldn t HAVE to go out of your way But if you re doing it because you care about a stranger s comfort that s a whole other tomato   Good character or not everybody has their own convictions We just have to figure out ours and not give a shit what other people think of them right 
Feminism,1615687719,I m not implying anything  I m saying the obvious  I don t know about you but I believe that kindness generate kindness If this man was inconsiderate to me when I expressed this fear of walking alone at night I d be inconsiderate to him in return Otherwise I try to be empathic and kind to people 
Feminism,1615687671, gt walking at night is safer as a woman than for a man yet women tend to report more fear  There s a lot to unpack there but there are a few immediate problems with using this as the basis for changing your behavior   The fact that women report more fear may be what s driving them to avoid situations that would make them victims of violent crime If women are more cautious their lower representation in crime statistics makes sense    Women are manifestly harassed more often in public than men in terms of stalking cat calling etc Basically every woman reports having had these experiences usually often So fearing men following them  and potentially escalating into harassment is totally rational Women are almost certainly more likely to be harassed randomly than men are to be victims of random crime    Notoriously female victims of sexual assault are often distrusted and even blamed   male victims of robbery not so much So women may feel they lack a kind of safety net  police support from acquaintances afterwards that men take for granted 
Feminism,1615687615,That s missing the point though I m not only scared of being physically assaulted walking home alone at night I m also fearful of catcalling being followed that some creep may make a note of my address etc Also I ve been robbed once and it sucked obviously but it did not impact my life I ve been raped twice and will probably be in therapy for the rest of my life You can t compare apples and asparagus and say see isn t the asparagus more oppressed than the apple They re completely different and face completely different problems 
Feminism,1615687201, gt He can not care But people will also not care for him    It s not a if  then  else statement People don t care for him regardless of whether or not he cares for others That s the experience he draws from or are you implying that you would care more about him if he tried to make women safer Or that you care fur OP because he makes women feel safer    Is that a metric I can use Should I care more for the safety of a a female acquaintance who takes part in environmental drives food kitchens etc as opposed to someone whose only contribution to society is that she works for big tobacco     gt Women don t ask much they ask appropriate behavior from men If OP s friend isn t doing anything intentionally disturbing he s decent If he thinks he should not care about women that s fine he can But it does make him sound like a utter idiot pretending that men suffer more and similar     I think indifference is adequate behavior in part because it is the norm      gt I walk across a parking lot in the daylight and pray to whatever fuck is in the sky that no men even talks to me The world is not the same for men and women Not in the day not in the night    That we can agree 
Feminism,1615687197,The questions generally not This is r AskFeminists not r DeradicalizeFeministsViaTheBrillianceOfYourLeadingQuestion I ve learned refined my opinions as a result of some of the discussion in the comments but it s pretty obvious when an OP is  asking a question that is really meant to be an anti feminist gotcha and those are not generally the type of  question that gets a lot of interesting engagement 
Feminism,1615687192,That men are victims of more  types of crime means nothing at all For example if  men were murdered  men assaulted  men robed and   women were sexually assaulted women still experience twice as much violence than men If you want to actually do a real comparison you will also have to consider multiple factors For example are men  being less scared than women more often walk alone  in unsafe areas How much of a factor is it that men make up for the huge majority of gang members  criminals in general Are men more likely to try start fights Etc etc I don t know the answers to these questions but they re very important if you want to know who s statistically more likely to be a victim of a violent crime  based on their gender alone  
Feminism,1615687180,I d rather be a victim of violent crime than rape or sexual abuse And in any case I m sure they re not considering domestic violence in this statistic 
Feminism,1615687147,Sure you re not responsible You  can be a kind person and make someone comfortable when it takes no effort on your part though I also cross the street and generally avoid women at night  it costs me literally nothing and if it makes them feel better that s great and I m happy I could make someone s life a little less shit Why is this so hard to understand 
Feminism,1615687122, gt he doesn t feel that his specific role of penis wielder is being replaced she may be sleeping with someone else but she isn t riding someone else s dick That is the whole problem That world view depends on putting all women in their own sperate class which apparently stands below  penis wieder  That not only devalues the sex between women that devalues women Besides it is also just inaccurate with the right tools and toys anyone of any gender can be a penis wielder 
Feminism,1615687056,So if a woman  and a feminist says VERY FEW men are genuine nice guys what s your thought That shes the main denominator 
Feminism,1615686961,Why exclude sexual assault though Is that not sufficiently awful to make us afraid Is getting literally murdered the only thing I should be afraid of I could experience anything from mild harassment to rape to kidnapping to murder The milder things are more likely but I still would prefer to not have them happen on a given outing And if someone is mildly harassing me I have no way of knowing how far they ll escalate That puts me more on edge than I would be if I could be certain that there would be no escalation I can t have that certainty so I have no choice but to take every situation seriously 
Feminism,1615686805,It s common sense that every claim should be investigated But to call every person who doesn t have evidence a liar knowing that there s a higher chance of them telling the truth due to how rare false accusations are is the dumbest shit ever Just because someone is found innocent in the court doesn t mean they re actually innocent Just like you people bitch about innocent people in jail there s an army of rapists walking free just because they know they can always claim it s hearsay if they get lucky 
Feminism,1615686711,You have the right to do that  As OP s friend has the right to not be considerate  He can not care But people will also not care for him  Women don t ask much they ask appropriate behavior from men If OP s friend isn t doing anything intentionally disturbing he s decent If he thinks he should not care about women that s fine he can But it does make him sound like a utter idiot pretending that men suffer more and similar  I walk across a parking lot in the daylight and pray to whatever fuck is in the sky that no men even talks to me The world is not the same for men and women Not in the day not in the night 
Feminism,1615686584,In particular when a heterosexual person believes that members of the opposite gender are awful it s probably because they ve put themselves in a position to be hurt by members of that gender rather than their own E g people of both genders will cheat on their partners but a straight woman can only have the experience of being cheated on by a man so in her experience men will likely have been worse to her than women 
Feminism,1615686306,Yuuup The right love to co opt useful concepts and twist overuse them until they are no longer fit for their original purpose It sucks because it is valuable and necessary to label highlight and discuss the racism of white women but one of the tools that women of color developed in order to draw attention to that discussion has been turned into a misogynist dog whistle for any insufficiently subservient woman For another example I remember when reality based media was becoming concerned about the rise of fact deficient rightwing propaganda the term everyone started using was  fake news  Then you know who got a hold of that term and suddenly nothing is true and everything is permitted 
Feminism,1615686304,I think the key thing here is that  safety is a strange standard for what could be considered acceptable behaviour We could easily imagine an alternative situation where instead of coincidentally heading the same way a man has decided to actively follow after a woman walking home in the dark for whatever reason  maybe he s seen her around and is curious where she lives Let s also say that he has no intentions of doing anything or even approaching her i e he s not actually  dangerous  In such a situation we can easily say that she is in fact still perfectly  safe  But just about anyone would still recognize this behaviour as completely fucked up Because she has no way of knowing his intentions and because the distress it would cause is already harmful all by itself regardless of safety 
Feminism,1615686126,Damn after reading this I think women should have free pads tampons I was gonna say they shouldn t be taxed cuz u need them Decent ones are fucking expensive Being broke and finding a pack of   pads for  dollars saved my life once Unless u wanna see my bloody mess   should be free
Feminism,1615685911,We are socialized to respond how we are treated it s a rare few who treat others better than we have been treated The friend is drawing from his past of no one giving a shit about him and applying it blanket for all humanity It s like the confusion I feel when hearing people say women ought to feel safe at night      and I think no    no one should feel safe at night that s when security is lax and criminal activities begin Going out at that hour is a risk for everyone you should feel scared    I walk very silently and quickly there have been atleast  instances where someone really wigged out as I passed them I don t stop I don t check to see if they are OK I don t reassure I just keep walking rapidly out pacing them Perhaps that s reassuring to them because it implies that my focus is not on them I just behave like the world is a free range with genderless meat shaped obstacles all around me that I must navigate around Surely that s enough
Feminism,1615685807,The part of you pointed sums perfectly the different between being a man and a woman in society  Woman fear for their bodies being assaulted groped and raped way more than they care about being robbed I d rather be robbed      times than be groped and abused Your friend clearly lacks knowledge on the context of this data and what they represent
