MensRights,1616972828,Also a point to consider is that campaign was created by an ad agency co founded by Charles Saatchi  The same guy who was cautioned by police a few years ago for putting his hands round the throat of his then wife Nigella Lawson while sat in public I ll not be taking lessons in behaviour from such a person 
MensRights,1616972806,It s not That same comparison gets made in every debate and thread related to this It won t make any impact other than to paint you as a racist in the eyes of the person you re making the point to 
MensRights,1616972703,You haven t searched the  sOUrCEs you so desperately want right Of course you didn t right 
MensRights,1616972617,Saying that someone s comments about sexism is invalid because of there skin colour very good YOU ARE RACIST
MensRights,1616972597,This seems like the nuclear option I can t imagine him getting his job back after going public like this and even if he did with that contract he won t keep it longer than   days I hope he s got a court case lined up 
MensRights,1616972382,Why would I go on a female dating strategy subreddit if I m not a female looking to date people 
MensRights,1616972306,The takeaway is when a woman says stop YOU FUCKING STOP Save the rape play for someone you know well and are comfortable with and always use a safe word Ladies I m sorry we can t tell if you re into rape or not so for both our sakes we should just play it safe 
MensRights,1616972073,Look I definitely hate when people trivialize and minimize the problems faced by another group  but this post isn t really that The title clearly States that its focused specifically on issues men face that they   aren t  sympathetic towards or don t care about  It deffo looks to me as though a lot of things that they believe are trivial or unimportant men s issues  like friend zoning or tinder failure aren t really  men s issues  They re just things they obviously hear lots of men complain about online  So you could look at it as a useful indicator that a lot of women don t really hate men but are just ignorant to men s genuine issues because they see more from subs like r niceguys and r creepyPMs than from subs like r MensRights
MensRights,1616971831,Nice try sexist hate troll   I didn t make up the word feminazi  It was made to describe people exactly like you  Misandry laden hateful feminist trolls like yourself You also flat out lie like even the  best of feminists pretending to care about equality when in reality all you do is attack male victims daily and don t say ONE word to your hateful feminist cohorts like on FDS There isn t even a shred of truth or human decency in you You are human cancer 
MensRights,1616971745,still sounds like a petty thing to bust your balls over like when feminists get mad they cant upload topless pics to instagram focus on the actual issues like the UK s plan at a curfew on guys or the fact that women in the middle east are being abused not this  st world problems smh
MensRights,1616971729,Just off the top of my head I can think of abortion which I would assume I have the same views on it as Feminists do 
MensRights,1616971676,I would say women are way more controlling especially in relationships All dating and relationships are is catering to women s preferences 
MensRights,1616971659,Yes you have a right to back out if kids is a deal breaker for you   you are not o lighted to stay with someone who cannot or will not meet your life needs 
MensRights,1616971656,Jesus the guys in the comments internalizing misandry is depressing So many are way to fine some of these The guys saying they cross the street to make room for women is ridiculous women are far less likely to be attacked we re literally just justifying paranoia 
MensRights,1616971552,Big deal Just put on a dress when you want to go out and self identify as a woman Lol
MensRights,1616971533,Well you re complaining about sexist women so yeah You pretty much aren t allowed to do that anymore 
MensRights,1616971484,Correction apartment block   I will note that I use that only as a prevalent example I presume it s fairly uncommon but I m sure most  man ban s typically have similar exemptions 
MensRights,1616971436,Aimee Challenor was a Green Party candidate    Says it all really 
MensRights,1616971425, gt So I m hoping the mods will forgive me because I could use some support from men Forgiveness is unnecessary We are here help to men regardless of their problems  Welcome 
MensRights,1616971214,I d totally create one just to see how it goes but other men would probably attack me for my history on this sub That if the mods don t remove the post 
MensRights,1616971173,nah chief if i had a daughter that raped someone shes not my daughter lets make that clear rape however often happens a shit ton more to women im not saying it doesnt happen to men because it does and people should he held accountable for that what im saying is that most then that get raped is by other men this is not directed towards u but if u only care about men s experiences with rape and sexual assault when its countering womens stories then dont say u care 
MensRights,1616970978,Chicks with dicks lol Men are strong Men adapt and survive Men conquer Men will come through this Men aren t the kind to complain endlessly without doing something about it Men fix things 
MensRights,1616970629,There would be hell of a backlash if there s a  list of womens issues you aren t empathetic enough on r askmen Hope that post gets shutdown and those misandrist get their party spoiled But I m keeping my hopes low knowing how much of a simp reddit has been 
MensRights,1616970627,I m from the U S but it seems to me that that Green Party baroness was speaking hyperbolically in an effort to make people men particularly understand her point of view in the matter It had been suggested that women stay home at night and this provoked many women who were already very upset about the incident So she was apparently just banging on her drum As gripped by wild feminist rhetoric as the U K sometimes seems to be from my admittedly limited outsiders vantage point surely there s no real threat of a male curfew moving forward That said the rhetoric in the U K around the disappearance of that Sara Everard is just nuts Your women are insane Kate Middleton going to lay flowers seemed a bit much Of course we have mass shootings on the daily in my country so maybe crime is more shocking to the average Briton but if so  doesn t that belie the claim that women aren t safe at night 
MensRights,1616970615,calling to defy a law in general is a bad thing   but I think this is an exception if the law passes I think people should protest men and woman should go to the street past     and disobey the law If the uk courts have the power they should rule the law as unconstitutional  or whatever equivariant they have for it there 
MensRights,1616970551,Feminists find it bad that there s Men who prefer big breasts but turn around and make fun of Men for having small genitals   Feminism is a joke 
MensRights,1616970482,Most of the violence against women happens inside the home Wouldn t that just mean that their abuser would spend more time with them 
MensRights,1616970449,If you are a man and you don t like these laws you should leave the UK and consider other places Out of all the countries the UK is one of the countries where a lot of anti male legislation is come up with and enforced the most 
MensRights,1616970440,Honestly almost spit my beer out Was that pun intended for the post  Haha
MensRights,1616970431,  a lot     l t  n      a large number or amount a great deal  there are a lot of actors in the cast   they took a lot of abuse   a lot can happen in eight months   we had lots of fun        alot     l t  n     a fictional mammalian creature with brown fur   invented by Allie Brosh the creator of the webcomic Hyperbole and a Half The creature was inspired by the common grammatical error writing the phrase  a lot as  alot  
MensRights,1616970419,Not really Alot of people voted for Ivanka Trump in the Senate Run Offs and that got stolen from her via vote draining  Caught live on tv  
MensRights,1616970412,Wait wait wait wtf is that  male curfew  thing  Do they really think about having men having a curfew but not women     What the actual fuck is that
MensRights,1616970246,Hillary is corrupt She e mails she sent our Troops to die in Benghazi and she even has people murdered who testify against her and her Husband 
MensRights,1616970169,Only if Reddit admins gave a shit about men then we wouldn t have subs like FDS and posts like this
MensRights,1616970158,So they really believe the curfew will stop the criminals Good luck with that More punishing the majority for the actions of a few It s outrageous As if dating wasn t hard enough with today s standards Even asking a Woman on a date can be described as sexual intimidation Makes me thankful that I married   year s ago 
MensRights,1616970157,The fuck is wrong with you racist It doesn t matter his skin color it s not ok 
MensRights,1616970079,Don t alienate Dems we need everyone on are side Dem Republican green libertarian socialist commy bastards 
MensRights,1616969781, About the title I always though that the best thing a man can do is stop taking his self esteem from women There is not reason to think about them as morally superior or particularly good so their opionion about you shouldn t matter MGTOW certainly got this right  
MensRights,1616969764,Do whatever you like even if it means you re  turning into a woman  We re the kings of our world 
MensRights,1616969507,I didn t make the claim you did It s your job to support it 
MensRights,1616969491, gt Would you be ok with using a pocket pussy instead of having real sex I sure as hell wouldn t And if I complain about it I am an  incel  They can satisfy themselves with dildos just as I do with masturbation That whole thing is them being bullies just as I would be if I started to complaing in the internet that my girlfriend has small tits 
MensRights,1616969433,I can t help but think of the  ironies here   Any such curfew would likely have a similar impact as gun free zones in otherwise gun present environments Those who want to do harm will know there s even less chance of being stopped   It s reported that the guy charged with the most recent prominent murder had a female accomplice in her thirties I m sure any curfew would likely have exemptions for couples  like when you see hotels banning single men at pools It s almost like   It wouldn t work 
MensRights,1616969420, gt Ok why should you or any man on this planet demonize feminism and everyone who chooses to call themselves feminist You didn t even read my previous reply did you    gt So I am sorry that I phrased the wrongs wrong I am new to this I m simply here to learn more about the male experience  No you re not You simply posting crappy nonsensical patronising BS  That s all EOS 
MensRights,1616969383,Because a few men are crazy we should ban all men from being outside after  pm according to them Imagine if you said something like  all muslims must stay indoors because some of them are terrorists  That would be insanely racist  for good reason  Why is this proposal even a thing   
MensRights,1616969232,Did you actually use the term coomer God this  insult is so pathetic XD
MensRights,1616969218,With BDSM ppl consent beforehand but the fact is there are plenty of women who dont explicitly say what they want and just expect the man to know  gt Now thinking about it this post must either be written by an incel making excuses for himself or a shill trying to start shit Which are you I m trying to bring light to this huge issue if that makes u mad thats not my prob 
MensRights,1616969165,Actually women have lower chances to be a victim of a violent crime Hell in many places a women raping a men is not consider legally rape Also women also watch porn in fact for what I read women are the biggest consumers of violente pornography such as rape porn 
MensRights,1616969156,   downvotes on the women s one and let s assume about half are the equivalent of people who d downvote the men s one that s still going to be way more than the downvotes on the men s The real observation is the difference in enthusiasm  How is it in a world where supposedly everything is about serving men people only give a shit about protecting women from sexual harassment from men 
MensRights,1616969054, gt Men already have rights so I dont get it Its women who get oppressed either visibly or invisibly Men dont have to fear getting murdered when they just mind their business Women have more rights and privileges than men  gt  Privilege is invisible to those who already have it  xx Yes such as yourself and other women Now fuck off you pathetic misandrist 
MensRights,1616969022,Those guys are just angry because feminists don t want anything with aLpHaS like them anymore I want nothing to do with them And conservatives and Dworkin style feminists where always allied 
MensRights,1616968973,Yep that s about how much of a fuck we re worth to them 
MensRights,1616968856,Yeah this ain t it but don t compare it to fucking sundown towns I d bet     OP is white smfh
MensRights,1616968713,Lying has nothing to do with trust She can lie regardless of how Ia man may believe in her Your second point doesn t make a stand because of my first point For the third point the woman gets a lot of leverage in bodily autonomy and cs from the  father of the child There are numerous cases where women are awarded huge amounts of money in family court and then go back to get even more money awarded to them Family court is used as a weapon against men and that is partly because of how much leverage women have over the  fathers finances because women are awarded primary custody more than men and just the bodily autonomy they have If women can fully decide what happens to the fetus that is fine but men should get a say in when or not he wants to stay For the last point what doe you suggest as a fair or equal way to relieve the biased court system MRAs are making suggestions but you seem to be against what is currently in the replies
MensRights,1616968647,And I fell for you when you used the word  epistemology in relation to  feminism  and you weren t joking

MensRights,1616968322,Comparing me to a nazi and suggesting I spout hate speech is far more of a personal attack than anything I have ever engaged in  Kind of makes sense that you are more likely to be banned than someone engaging in civil discussion like myself 
MensRights,1616968319,A few people saw this as an attack of feminism  The OP was making feminist look bad according to them because they posted this  Some even said there was no way this could be real because men don t face misandry in the real world It turns out this was actually created by a well known feminist group in the UK  A fact that we wouldn t have found out if feminists hadn t shown up with a guilty conscious to preemptively say  this isn t what feminism is supposed to be about  they said this before anyone even mentioned feminism  A lot of people seem pretty open about this being harmful to men and their mental health though  It s not that bad of a sub and it has a goal in line with the men s rights movement addressing mental health problems from a male perspective 
MensRights,1616968233,Eh the CDC study I was referencing was done as phone surveys These aren t really reported so I wouldnt say that for the CDC study as much 
MensRights,1616968222,There is a proposal in the UK to put a  PM curfew for men so they don t  harm women  
MensRights,1616968058,I m a woman studying a STEM subject and what s funny to me is that during school we were shown presentations that actively tried to encourage and persuade girls to pick STEM subjects Even after active encouragement there were very few females who chose those subjects And yet the unequal outcome still sparks outrage  I ve also met a couple of feminist types who usually congratulate me after I inform them about the subject I study before going on a tangent about how important it is to have more women in STEM to combat the inequality I usually just question why they decided as women not to study those subjects themselves if its so important that we have more women in STEM specifically Usually the answer is that they were interested in something else   
MensRights,1616967940,Resegregation Except this time it s okay because they re choosing to do it to themselves in order to avoid the evil whites 
MensRights,1616967640,Nah as a woman I completely agree that female spaces are very fucking toxic Going to Girl Scout camp was miserable because everyone was at everyone s throats all the time Part of the reason I like hanging out with guys more they are so much more chill and don t worry about gossiping and shit 
MensRights,1616967551,Sometimes people have to work gig jobs to make ends meet because they re underpaid at a regular student or have a sick family member or they simply have no choice The gig economy seems to take full advantage of these people making them essentially  slaves Sure people dont need to eat either its their choice to consume food or its their choice to have shelter i guess 
MensRights,1616967410,I recommend not reading the comments on that thread unless you want your blood to boil Most seem fine with men restricting who they speak to on the basis of their sex they just find a  nice way to dress up that notion It s their rationalization of sexism trying to protect themselves from treating a sex as inherently threatening or inferior based on their prejudices And that s how this ad makes me feel   as though whoever made it has an anti male prejudice 
MensRights,1616967310,This looks like something for  r menkampf Just how hysterical are UK women anyway if this is how they treat men 
MensRights,1616967242,You don t know how to use Google  Because if you can t use Google to simply search it yourself then clearly you wouldn t even be able to read any source I provide you  Not a coward just don t give enough of a fuck about some dumbass on the internet to waste my time searching shit for you Type  social media narcissism into Google and you can do the rest yourself like a big boy girl

MensRights,1613607040,Hey guys I just started a podcast to work on trying to struggle my way through some harder conversations talking to friends and professionals who have different viewpoints than me I feel like the tribalism and group think dynamics that social media is teaching us is killing the art of the conversation so I wanted to work on getting better and speaking and listening for long periods of time  long enough periods of time that I could begin to genuinely get to know people and perspectives that I don t understand That s the project of  This Could Be Interesting  In this first episode I took some time to talk to my friend Ken Paradis who s a lit professor at Laurier University in Brantford Ontario He has a bunch of interesting things to say about religion especially evangelicalism and cultural identity We took some time to sit down and talk through some of his ideas and ended up spending a lot of time trying to sort out the role of masculinity in the modern postmodern postpostmodern world    If you make it through our fumbling around let me know if you agree with any of the points we made What does masculinity even mean Is it defined by society evolution both or neither Does it have something to do with individuality I don t know exactly but I m still working on trying to figure it out 
MensRights,1613598969,I don t know what to say I feel judged for being male I actually fucking hate it So much Like with my soul  She s talking about men that are that way  is an answer I often see under men bashing posts But the thing is that s not true They are talking about men no  omg racist men     just men And not even with issues that are related to men Being homophobic is not exclusive to men But men are the evil of this world so I guess it makes sense   
MensRights,1613585488,This girl I dated for about two months one day stopped answering my messages when in friendship terms after the relationship Stopped talking for a year and wondered if she was alright because of the pandemic I sent a couple messages asking her in a span of  weeks without answer Everything from a respectful place and even stated in every message that of she wanted me to stop texting her she should just say it and there would be no problem with it Received a  trial citation because of this incident where she accuses my of her rasing her for year and a half Also talking about other girls I did the same to I don t drink get into fights I m not violent and have a really small social circle Tried to get an exs testimony for my good behavior but she put sorority first so she could not help me when the problem involved another woman It s really sad having to realize two of the people you trusted the most just weren t really backing you up I m scared to death as this can mean being kicked out of my university My hearing is tomorrow but I can t sleep or let alone think anything besides all of these All proof point to a civil behavior towards her 
MensRights,1613542897,Hi I don t usually do things like this but It s     AM and I found something which made me so upset and angry and I feel like if I don t let this out I ll explode this is difficult for me to talk about it here s the video   A few years back  when I was    a girl from my class used the defenetition sexual harrassment to get me kicked out of a college  It was from a FB message I didn t write and that I apologised for  She not only said this message was harassment but also fabricated things I didn t even say  this was as a revenge for a series of unrelated events between me and her  the principle  woman and deputy principle  man took me in  while I was accompanied by my dad not only did they not ask or listen to my side of the story in any way but the principle started screaming and shouting at me  and my dad calling me  underdeveloped and essentially making me out to be a sexual abuser while the deputy principle just powertripped and said things to me to get effect Even when my dad argued with them they didn t budge  amp  x   B After this experience I left my country  Ireland honestly for the better because this college wasn t benefitting me I found myself feeling dirty and ashamed over having any kind of sexual thought I had trouble even looking at an attractive woman  It made me feel weird which hard to explain on here It also made masturbation very difficult and my libido was continually getting lower  I m getting over the experience but my libido is still very low I also felt very humiliated and was unable to talk to my dad for a long time I only recently addressed this with him last month actually My problems with this video   It makes incredibly angry when the media or people act as If men don t understand boundaries or how not to abuse women as if they re animals with no morals    sexual harassment by defenition even though it was and is still sometimes a legitmate problem is way too vague and which can cause alot of problems  this is just my personal opinion and this isn t new It s actually been like this since the    s   Women abuse and sexually harass men too and this is continually ignored   alot of young men have issues with sexual shame guilt psychological problems etc and I really feel all this just backs these anxieties and problems up I ve been trying to avoid this stuff as much as possible as of late but I just really slipped up tonight I really hope this idea of men needing to learn consent ends eventually but It s hard to tell If I said something that might be considered offensive I do apologise this just really had an effect on me and I had to let it out somehow 
MensRights,1613480476,I have a   year old son  He is on medicaid and they decided to cover his braces even though this is not normally allowed  His mother has supposedly refused to take him to his dental orthodontist for around a year  He is a kid and doesn t do the best job of caring for his teeth  I noticed there was a problem because of the buildup on his braces  Do I make a big deal about this lack of care with his mother or do I make him responsible for getting his mother to take care of it  He says he has asked and she refuses to take him  It isn t a money issue  Her significant other bought her a        car  I don t think he has pushed hard enough but should he really have to  His mother has been divorced from me for over   years and I rarely talk to her on purpose 
MensRights,1613478480,Found this in an article in a site called swaddle It s from india and by their logic and reasoning men can t be victims of sexism I can t comprehend this idea and do care to enlighten me  Finally feminism can t be sexist towards men because of how oppression works It has a unidirectional systemic flow from a group at the top that has social and cultural sanction to misuse power toward the group at the bottom Patriarchy hurts everyone  even men  but as long as men are in a greater position of social power that allows them to oppress women culturally socially legally and financially they can t be victims of sexism  This is the link to the article   arguments against feminism research data  
MensRights,1613470834,So it s just a little thing I d like to share  I live in a post soviet country so it s already a bit depressing But that s besides the point What I want to talk about is the military  In my country if you re a man  from   to twenty something  don t remember it of the top my head you get called for an examination  to determine if you re  fit to serve twice a year And starting at   if you don t have a good reason not to join the army  I e chronic illnesses broken bones but that only helps for a time being gay for just not straight also works here you might just get enlisted against you will and send to peel potatoes god knows where  If you re not showing up you can get fined and even jailed  Getting higher education helps because if you prove that you re actually studying they ll stop bothering you for around  years  And it s not like the examination itself is any good I can really find the words here the best I can come up with is  dehumanizing  There isn t really a single part of the process that all that bad it s just doctors who aren t interested in anything asking you things and checking if you really have these problems But the part that just pisses me off is the last part you just walk in a room alone with a doctor and he just goes over every health problem you claimed to have And I get it they re trying to figure out if you re just lying to get out of service But the whole process is so god damn frustrating because at every turn they just assume you re a piece of crap who never tells the truth and every proof you present is also crap  It s obvious that only men have to go through this And in my opinion the whole process wouldn t be too bad if not for the societal pressure of it all If you don t want to join the army most teachers  only in school treat you like shit for not wanting to slave away a year of your life I mean my own dad didn t serve he just worked in construction when he was in uni  in the USSR  yet he always says that I m a wimp  or something like that Language barrier and so on for not wanting to work for free for a year  Quite a lot of people think that it s fine that a man has to either serve or he s not a man  There s always getting a contract but it pays relatively little and lasts a minimum of  years It is also almost impossible to get a contract because the bar is set very high But that s only for men Women have the bar set unbelievably low plus they get a payed education guaranteed after service  Sorry for the rant just needed to get it off my back Also sorry for mistakes in grammar second language and all

MensRights,1613458430,   This is an interesting read   Here s a quick summary  Fathers are the butt of jokes more frequently in recent sitcoms than in the past  Fathers are shown in fewer parenting situations in more recent sitcoms  And when fathers were parenting it was depicted as humorously foolish in just over    of the relevant scenes in the     s and     s compared with    in the     s and    in the     s sitcoms Welcome to the zeitgeist  men bad women good 
MensRights,1613454092,I ve been trawling through UN documents and in the lastest one the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women comes right out and states redistribution of power and resources to women is one of their goals The Committee makes recommendations to States This one was about the application of  temporary special measures which are intended to make up for discrimination  Here are a couple of choice quotes which I found shocking   General recommendation No    Article   paragraph   of the Convention  temporary special measures    amp  x   B  gt    Measures taken under article   paragraph   by States parties should aim to accelerate the equal participation of women in the political economic social cultural civil or any other field The Committee views the application of these measures not as an exception to the norm of nondiscrimination but rather as an emphasis that temporary special measures are part of a necessary strategy by States parties directed towards the achievement of de facto or substantive equality of women with men in the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms While the application of temporary special measures often remedies the effects of past discrimination against women   the obligation of States parties under the Convention to improve the position of women to one of de facto or substantive equality with men exists irrespective of any proof of past discrimination   The Committee considers that States parties that adopt and implement such measures under the Convention do not discriminate against men  amp  x   B  gt    Although the application of temporary special measures may not be possible under all the articles of the Convention the Committee recommends that their adoption be considered whenever issues of accelerating access to equal participation on the one hand   and accelerating the redistribution of power and resources   on the other hand are involved as well as where it can be shown that these measures will be necessary and most appropriate under the circumstances    Source PDF

MensRights,1613416974,Sandeep Nahar an Indian actor committed suicide today Few hours before his body was found he made a vlog and post on his Facebook account about the reason of his tragic and unnecessary death I found the note on Twitter  which is apparently not a complete note of which I have a rough translation in the comments His vlog contains details of how his wife and her mother used to torture him each and every day threatened him with false claims and suicide He said he could not come forward because society would not believe him the usual plight of a male victim  I won t post the facebook link or image here because it can possibly lead to trouble But I did a rough translation of the note which is easily available on twitter 
MensRights,1613409280,I ve been raising hell any time I encounter someone who uses the sexist and hateful slur  mansplaining   I wrote a letter of complaint to the Mars Corporation over their use of the term in their Super Bowl ad  There is no legitimate use of this word  It s used to shut down discussion via shaming and it implies that a man s explanation is automatically invalid based on gender alone  Our society would never tolerate targeting other groups with this kind of word creation  Imagine if a major company like Mars had used words like  jewsplaining   blacksplaining   femsplaining  or even  chinasplaining   There would be an uproar and rightfully so  So I wrote them back to let them know that s not acceptable   I ve also complained on social media any time someone uses that bigoted word  It s a word dreamed up by hateful feminists to denigrate men  There is no legitimate use of it  I ve seen feminists claim it s needed to express the idea of a man explaining to a woman in a condescending way but that s a cop out  That s still stereotyping men as people who act that way  Condescending speech has no gender  We have non gender biased terms in English for expressing that idea   I ve encountered people being very surprised that someone would object to this term  They try to belittle me to shut me up by saying the same old cliches like  fragile male ego   which is another sexist and hateful term   But I won t back down  I ve had it up to here with this bigoted term and so I m fighting back   I m curious if any of my brothers out there have had similar experiences and what you ve done to fight back against this hate speech  I won t stand for this hypocritical and sexist word being normalized  There are other man bashing  sexist terms but this is the one that really disgusts me   If you ve been fighting back as well please let me hear from you  But if you wish to write to try to justify this term of hate please don t bother  You should not try to justify misandry on a men s rights board  You can go find some other forum where this type of hate speech is tolerated   But to those of you who have been fighting back against this bigotry thank you

MensRights,1613404606,Yes I generalized the question just so you can make a sense out of it for me I m a big puzzle enthusiast and love everything about them   important   Someone was arguing with me about how it s unfair that men and women don t compete against each other I gave her not one but three examples and she told me that they don t count These are the examples   There are competitions for Rubik s cube type twisty puzzles known as speed cube competitions In those competitions both guys and girls compete against each other to get the fastest time There are many types of events for multiple puzzles But most of the time both guys and girls are competing against each other   The same is the case with chess Both men and women compete against each other Yes there might be events for women only or men only but it doesn t mean men and women don t compete against each other even in a professional competition   Similarly in the competition of Sudoku both men and women compete against each other I m sure there are a lot but these were the ones that came on top of my head Generally speaking I may not know any competitions related to strength but I know at least  competitions related to wits where men and women compete with each other Why is it that these examples don t count if they are not that famous or not related to strength As a puzzle enthusiast my opinion might be biased in favour of puzzles so I would like your opinion about it

MensRights,1613738591,Just watched a TikTok about a women whose studying to be a doctor joking about how she s in debt while women are making money off of OF No problem with the video scrolled down to the comments One guy said something along the lines of  You re good They re ruining people s lives and you ll be helping people s lives  One woman replied its the men who are ruining their lives Ok Another comment said women are profiting off of  misogyny  First of all women need to stop acting like these women doing OF are some morally upright women cause they re not They re in love with money and see a chance to use their looks to profit off of LONELY DESPERATE DEPRESSED and traumatised addicted men Cause that s most of the men buying OF they wanna feel special which is why they go with a single creator but usually their lives are hell Its the men s choice yeah just as a drug addict goes to the dealer by their own choice but these women are shallow They are essentially worsening their lives by providing for their addiction to sexual content The horrible effects of p rn and m sturbation addiction so no they re not completely out of blame or atleast they re not good people Its funny that women doing OF is  empowering but the men paying are  misogynistic  Feminists love demonizing men for anything because they want to perceive men as evil The men paying are lonely and need female attnetion most likely depressed too However it s easier to disconnect from a person if you view them as subhuman so feminists will say that instead Its funny cause they ll show so much sympathy to traumatised and mentally ill p rn stars but no sympathy for p rn addicts with the same conditions I m starting to feel like women are aware of this too That s why so many women advertise their new OF pages on dating apps They target lonely men and get them to spend all their money Its sick

MensRights,1613697172,I came across a interesting fact recently In a survey done by the CDC in      the most recent gender comparison survey by the CDC  called the  National Intimate Partner and Sexual Abuse Survey   more men reported intimate partner domestic abuse then women  I will be rounding to the thousand in this post for simplicity           men reported it compared to          women Now we already know women will victim blame men so let me drop that right here The difference between these two numbers is around          which would be    of intimate partner domestic abuse reported in this survey Domestic abuse in gay relationships is thought to be about    so let s do the math That would be        of the total           So now we still have a        difference between both numbers and          cases left Since we accounted for homosexual relationships all of those          cases are women abusing men Now to be fair we will take the    lesibian and gay relationship abuse is about the same and subtract that from the           Now since the same amount was from both sides we have a difference of        again and the numbers for women are now           all come by men Now that we ve accounted for homesexual relationships and covered all the statistical mumbo jumbo we can get to the interesting part If men are abused so much more in relationships then why are abusive relationships stereotyped as men abusing women and women get more support in this aspect   They twisted the narrative and told half the truth As an major example of them getting more support let s talk about the good ol VAWA  or was it VAVA  Basically they use government money to support intimate domestic abuse shelters and such But they have a large bias against men  mEn CaNt bE AbUsed ThEy ArE StRoNgEr and won t fund men s domestic abuse shelters but will gladly give money to a women only one On top of that this bias actually harms men in abusive relationships a lot Not only are they usually turned down from most domestic abuse shelters they are even arrested after they call the police for help because they assume  man stronger  man instigator  Now why are people ignoring this It s because feminism told white lies and made  reinforced stereotypes of men being abusive There s basically this same attitude towards men being raped but that s a different story And the worst thing about it is feminists always victim blame and say  well men are the ones doing it  I already disproved that and  it s the patriarchy s fault  feminism slang for  some men were in power   years ago so it s mens fault for all this  It may sound like I m going a bit over the top here but it s just so hypocritical Any suggestions comments This is my first time making such a large post on such a large topic

MensRights,1613625096,The law ratio  laws lobbied for by feminists for women and for men and growing bias towards men shows the original motives of the  st wave Since people didn t have stats and surveys to see the downsides of being men they meant by equality to move up and be equal that way because they saw the obvious fact they were put below men therefore they mean  get better laws to be on par with men rather then  make men and women equal in all ways which explains why the act the way they act and why it doesn t seem to live up with the latter defention They didn t know how bad it was I think this makes fair sense do you agree

MensRights,1613867100,I just got out of this mess happening and thought I needed to vent a bit to get this thing out of my mind and move on with the movie I was watching beforehand     So I a        cm engineering student live in a condo  many houses enclosed by a wall with my family for the time being during the pandemic My brother was playing football in the courtyard when out of nowhere a dog comes running in his direction and grabs the ball out of his feet and proceeds to destroy the ball We my family is pretty close to our neighbors and the dog was not familiar  which directly led him to think it might have rabies which is why we didn t fight back  He get s home is very sad and irritated because it was his only birthday present for last year  of course no party thanks to COVID and says the dog is still in the courtyard and is worried he may go after the balls that were still there from the younger kids from the other side of the street My father who has a history of very complicating diseases and if catches the virus is sure to be dead within the week goes out to help me pick up the other balls and we proceed to lock the dog in the court to keep it from running away before we find it s owner     Right after we do that we hear one of our  what pandemic  female neighbors who parties every week coming out calling the dog s name and obviously does not have a mask on I repeat  five times calling her to  put your mask on as she hurries down the hill She stops no more than   cm   foot from my face when I tell her  will I have to hold you back  and she replies with  If you touch me I ll call the cops on you   Nervous but level minded as I could be I reply with  No problem now put on your mask  She goes right back to her house picks a mask goes down the hill no problem and I even make sure to get at least   feet away from her She picks up her dog says we can put the destroyed ball on her mom s check and we both head back to our respective houses     Now it is important to point out that this was only the second time I really interacted with this woman and the first one was when we she threw a party right when I had just come back from S o Paulo doing some volunteering at a hospital there  I ll just say I could not last long there  It s also very critical to point out that nobody is vaccinated yet and she know my fathers medical history pretty well     A few minutes after we get back this girl s mother calls saying that her daughter was threatened by my that I grabbed her and basically assaulted her I would not be too worried in many circumstances but the damn girl in a freaking lawyer with  month old baby  who did not deter her from partying like crazy of course and threatened to sue me for assault     And the worst part is my parents are now shouting at me saying that I m on my own and that the whole judicial system is geared against me and if there are expenses I ll have to find a job to pay it All because I DID NOT WANT MY FATHER DEAD     I m gonna be honest that I really want to move out and get on with in person school as soon as I possibly can Those friends who really know me know I could not hurt a damn bee if I wanted to  generally I just spend way too much time trying to get them to fly back through the window to safety   and now I m scared to death because I now that just an accusation like that regardless of court decision could haut me for the rest of my life According to my parents she won t bring charges or anything but I should not be so scared for my life just because of standing my ground and telling her to put on a mask during a fucking once in a hundred years pandemic that may I just remind you guys has killed more Americans than the entirety of WWII     I m just angry scared tired and just want to get back to working on telescopes and spacecraft like I was a year ago       If you guys have any advice I would greatly appreciate it I m just a young person and have never felt so scared of having been born with the wrong bits down there   If it helps I m based on the southernmost state of Brazil       Just to prove how non  alpha male I am the movie I was watching in Notting Hill  I know I know

MensRights,1614040483,So I was just at the gym at my university and was standing by the rock wall which is right by where I swipe in and a dude stands there to verify your a student or member So this girl walks in checks in keeps walking and the guys turns around to glance in the direction of her walking but could have been looking at anything She comes over by me and tells the guy at the rock wall desk about it and he agreed that he was staring to long and to report it to the front desk she claimed he  always looks at her weird I personally didn t see the guy do anything wrong what so ever but do his damn job I don t think reporting him on some bullshit sexual harassment type claim is morally right and can ruin someone s life over nothing I just couldn t believe what I had just witnessed For context the girl was African American and the guy working the front was white as far as I could tell and the rock wall guy was Idk some sort of tan skinned maybe Latino maybe Middle East Idk hard to tell Anyone think this was a bullshit claim

MensRights,1613961784, So I had a friend who got falsely accused of rape And I ve been thinking of this almost problem for a while but can you ever completely prove one received consent  It just seems like almost anything can be said to vitiate consent at any time But to me more accurate this is my example in words Let s say this guy does it all He asks the girl for verbal consent before he starts periodically he checks up on her to make sure the consent is still ongoing The girl is completely sober Etc etc  Then she goes and claims rape And her argument is yes I consented but I only did it out of fear as the man is a  ft      lb African American varsity athlete  Can one even argue against that The only argument I even see that could go against that would be arguing that one is not a physical threat And that seems impossible given the stats
MensRights,1613953187,While circumcision is an perfect example of male disposability effecting male children   there are also other examples of male disposability effecting male children too Like an example is that boys are more likely to get in trouble at schools than girls are even if the girl is misbehaving more than the boy is Also I heard that a study found that female teachers are likely to grade students tests lower when they knew the test taker was a boy And also in movies and in TV shows and in other forms of fiction male children are much more likely to be shown getting hurt or killed than female children are That really makes me mad since male children are just as vulnerable as female children are and they deserve the same protection and respect that they get

MensRights,1613937742,On the Ben Shapiro show there is a point where Ben talks about Harry Styles wearing a dress and complains about it At one point he talks about how a woman he knows admitted she would punch her husband for wearing something like that He treats this as perfectly okay This woman is objectively an abusive wife but Ben Shapiro is fine with that He says nothing even implying he has a problem with it On his sister s channel  Classically Abby she complains about the same thing and literally objectifies him claiming that he should stop wearing the dress because he doesn t find it fuckable This is literally a gender bent version of classic misogyny It didn t even occur to her that this is a questionable thing to say In fact multiple Republicans have expressed similar opinions It is perfectly normal among these people to tell men to change themselves to cater to their personal tastes The insistence on manly men is the same as the insistence on feminine women 
MensRights,1613931170,Hi so this is kinda a story analysis of the stuff that made me an MRA and my experiences with sexism Let s start from the beginning During my childhood my mother was emotionally manipulative and abusive towards me my sister and her husband As a kid I always felt like home was a potential war zone as we never knew when she was going to snap and start yelling and emotionally abusing us I never really had any connections as a kid and felt all alone  During my early school years I found it hard to make friends and was often sad I tended to be reserved and ungodly quiet It didn t help that much of the trauma from at home stuck with me throughout most of the day I would sometimes try to tell my teachers about how I didn t like seeing my mother so upset at my father  she primarily yelled at him but would also yell at me an my sister from time to time  and they would just say that that s what all parents do During my later years of school I did eventually make friends and opened up a bit more to others My mother still berated me and my family during this time During my middle school years and elementary school years I always felt inferior to the teachers  who were primarily female as well as the girls in my grade I think it was mostly due to my situation with my mother at home It still didn t help with my self esteem During high school I transferred school systems and I was back at having zero friends I was shy as usual and felt like an outsider During this time the modern wave of feminism was starting to creep in as well as the     election During high school many of the male degradation campaigns started to creep into the high school and lectures Also I was online a bit more and more of the things about how men are unable to know what pain is or are inherently inferior This is where some of my MRA attitudes came into play I knew that being treated as a lesser being was not right and I would not bow down to the women who were  constantly being oppressed and unable to be mean or abusive because I knew dang well that was a lie I had seen and felt firsthand how women could be abusive and that men had their own set of problems just like them During college is when it really took off I started college in      and this is when stuff was really getting out of hand for radical feminism and anti male propaganda While I  thankfully was never accused of assaulting or raping anyone it still didn t mean that my experience was positive During freshman orientation we were given a speech on sexual assault and rape Not once did they mention men being victims It also didn t help that I was very sexually inexperienced at this time unlike everyone else I didn t have a girlfriend or boyfriend since high school or right before college so some of the stuff they were saying about sexual assault and rape was new to me It was infuriating hearing a bunch of girls snarking on how anyone who hadn t heard of the stuff they were talking about was an idiot There was another talk less than a month later and it was similar in the fact that there was zero sympathy for men and zero mention of male victims As time wore on in college things kept getting worse with the university pushing for more female oriented talks about violence and sympathy It worsened my already bad anxiety and depression My two trips to the mental hospital didn t help either and I received little sympathy Anyways all this showed me that the modern  world did not care for the problems that men had It made me  and many on this sub feel like lesser people I do not hate women in the slightest and I don t blame them for everything wrong in my life In fact I support women s rights and wish them the best in life However I have no sympathy for misandrists and the ignorance of male suffering and demonizing of men as a whole TLDR Grew up with an abusive mother and school system that downplayed my experiences at home lead to severe depression and a rejection of modern anti male propaganda and modern feminism

MensRights,1613909846,I  m got into a debate with my friend  f who claimed there are no differences between men and women aside from physical strength and body parts My argument centered around behavioral differences and I made the point that on average men are more aggressive and interested in things and women are more agreeable and interested in people but there is more behavioral variance within each group then between This is why you see the most violent humans skew heavily male  She blamed all differences on externally driven forces like societal norms and felt male behavior is a result of how they are raised and what they are told they should be like rather than biologically driven forces  I m looking for more examples to prove my point that the majority of male female behavior is driven by biological forces One thing I remembered was car insurance is more expensive for men than women But that that could still be explained away by  external forces

MensRights,1614098969,I m sick and tired of this attitude  First marriage puts massive demands on a man  Feminism has demanded that women be released from their gender roles but men are still expected to adhere to theirs and more so than ever  You re expected to be a great provider by making lots of money  Then if you do and you get married any quick no fault divorce can swipe half of that wealth away from you plus possibly alimony and child support  For a man marriage is a great way to become financially destitute  So then if a man makes the rational decision to not participate in marriage society looks at him as some kind of creep  Who s life is it anyway  You can either get married and have those huge demands put on you and likely be destroyed financially and emotionally or you can opt out and receive a heaping helping of social stigma as unmarried men are constantly suspected of being up to no good  If you even look at someone the wrong way you re assumed to be some kind of child molester   I m so tired of all this crap I d rather live alone in a cabin in the woods and spend my days reading or canoeing on the nearby lake  Maybe I could write some stories on a manual typewriter  But being stuck in corporate America and simply expected to earn a lot and support a woman   that sucks  I m sick of it  I don t understand why any man would take the massive risk that is marriage

MensRights,1614083654,Currently I m a    year old guy and am in a much better place than I used to be when I was falsely accused of rape and sexually assaulting this girl in school and thankfully things didn t get out of hand for me during the whole situation and I got away from it relatively quickly   So this story occurred  and a half years ago when I was in school   I was always the quiet kid in school unless I was around people I was very comfortable with I was an above average but not a superb student I was in the school band and in the school table tennis team  and most of the band members were a part of the table tennis team we were almost always together and represented my school till the state level once   I was a pretty reputed student around the school and was considered as one of the nice kids who were kind always submitted homework before time worked hard in school projects and most of the teachers  who didn t teach me as well knew me pretty well   I wasn t socially great but still recognized well throughout the school   So in  th grade a week after the midterm examination we were having a PE lecture after which we had our recess I spent all of that time  one hour for PE and   minutes in recess with my friends all of us played table tennis together and then ate our lunch together  in the class our class teacher was in the class as well  right after the recess during lectures I was called by one of the peons saying that I was called by the principal   I ve never been called by the principal outside of a couple of situations where they called me and my table tennis team just to talk and congratulate us for doing well but I ve never been called alone   so I was a bit confused   while going to the principal s office the peon gave me many weird disgusted looks which I didn t know why he did so at the time   I enter the principal s office to see a girl crying with her hands over her face  I don t recognize her and the principal looking at me with a VERY angry look   I ask what s going on she tells me to shut up and said  what you did is completely disgusting you don t deserve to be on this school premises and I am considering suspending you for this which really caught me off guard cuz she s never spoken to me like that before   I ask again what happened and she tells me in a very condescending manner  oh so you don t know what you did just a few minutes ago  to which I replied that I was eating food with my friends in class   and then she asks the girl to tell everyone her story again    Back story of the girl she s a student from the other class and she s one of the entitled girls who wasn t that super popular but still had many friends she apparently had a crush on me and she asked me out a few weeks before the midterm exams to which I rejected her very respectfully telling her that I wasn t looking for any form of relationship nor am I interested in dating anyone and it was nothing against her her story mentioned that during PE class I went to the  th floor where she was and while she was going to the washroom I followed her and went into the washroom right behind her and also then manage to keep her quiet with my hands pull down my pants and rape her for   minutes and then leave her in the washroom floor and back to where ever I was   and I was devastated on listening to the story cuz I ve never even thought of doing this to ANY woman I know  or even not know and I would never wish it upon anyone ever   I immediately started stuttering and struggling to speak cuz I was still trying to interpret what she said I kept trying to say that I was with my friends the whole time struggling to say anything and mumbling most of the things almost on the verge of tears the principal then threatens to call my parents and I get very scared cuz they re very abusive to me and I don t know what they would do to me even after I was proven innocent I kept repeating that I was with my friends the whole time to which then the principal  said  okay then call your friends I want to hear from them and I ll be checking CCTV footage of where you were  my friends were called and the principal had the footage of my class the  th floor corridor and the table tennis room pulled out cuz those were the places I either was or claimed to have been there  I was in the table tennis room during PE and in my classroom during recess I was playing table tennis with my friends during the time period the girl specified and my friends also testified for the fact that I was with them the whole time and even my class teacher was called and she testified for me too   it was clearly visible that I was innocent and that I didn t do anything remotely close to what she said and then the girl says that all my friends were in on it my teacher was in on it too and started saying more and more lies and tries to maneuver her way out of the situation   my friends and I were told to leave the room and we did so too   I couldn t sleep for a couple of days after that cuz I was so scared because of the whole situation and thought that I would be treated like a rapist put in jail thrown out from my school my parents would disown me and a lot of other thoughts   a couple of weeks later after the whole situation I m told that I ve been from the table tennis team and won t be allowed to represent my school in any form of competition ever again I was also from the school band the girl was told almost nothing other than the fact that she had to go through an hour or so long lecture from the principal she still told her lies to all of her friends and many other teachers even though I had proved my innocence within mere minutes of being accused I was treated like a criminal in school my friends spoke to me less as well cuz they didn t want to be painted as a  rapist s friend  and I don t blame em for that I got bullied a whole lot more than I used to be my teachers would be more sarcastic towards me everyone gave me the looks and made the last year and a half of school a living hell for me   thankfully these topics were never brought up to my parents in any way and my teachers didn t bring it up to my parents during the parent teacher meetings though they were passive aggressive during em overall   it was a really rough time for me cuz I was treated like an outcast it made me go into depression and get into self harm telling myself that I was actually a rapist beating myself up for rejecting the girl even having suicidal thoughts and considering that life just wasn t of any use anymore everyone would treat me like this even after school was done   it made me miserable   but I m glad I hang on to dear life then   after school was over everything was a lot better for me   since the whole situation never got out of the school  cuz the school didn t share it basically shut it down to keep their own reputation high as well and since I ve gotten into college I ve gotten away from the whole story and it isn t a tag attached to me anymore   nowadays I always keep my distance from all the women I know surrounding myself with people who could testify for me staying around CCTV cameras at all times so that I can prove my location at any time   and I really suggest you all do so too   never having girls as friends ever again   I was reminded of this story today cuz of a nightmare I had with a very similar story   and just wanted to vent about it and also spread awareness that just stay away from women and surround yourself with trustable people    gt Note I won t be sharing the names of the girl principal peon teachers myself or my school in the comments or anywhere to maintain my own privacy you all are completely in your right to doubt or question this story in any way because you should never trust a random story completely and always have an ideology of innocent till proven guilty   these concepts go both ways   I m not in a court battle to give any revealing information about myself to anyone here

MensRights,1614422284,Linkedin Study    amp  x   B This LinkedIn study from     used their internal data to examine differences between men and women when job searching Among the key findings are the fact that men and women view a similar number of jobs though women apply to    fewer A recruiter is    more likely to view a man s profile which she described as result of a problematic bias that must be corrected  even though they also found that recruiters will still contact both genders at equal rates  However the author  Maria Ignatova makes no effort to hide her own bias  and sexism by writing  gt The good news is that when women do apply to a job they are    more likely than men to get hired In fact if the role is more senior than their current position that number goes up to        gt    gt While this is an uplifting stat it does show that women do a very thorough job at vetting roles  sometimes maybe too thorough If women only apply when they feel extremely qualified this could also indicate they are not pursuing stretch opportunities Linkedin is a mainstream website not a fringe feminist blog Yet blatant discrimination in hiring practices is celebrated as  good news and as  uplifting stat s   This doesn t lead to equality it s just another piece of evidence that equality isn t the actual goal Her analysis is also very weak and uses the usual strategy of reframing all issues so that women are the real victims I think a more plausible hypothesis for why men apply to    more jobs is because if we are getting rejected more often then we need to submit more applications to increase our chances of finding work Of course I would submit fewer if I was getting offers at       higher rate For most of us this is just seeing statistics that support what we already knew is happening The worst part is just being gaslit and told this is  equality and if we have a problem with it we are misogynist or examples of  toxic masculinity  I just wonder how far it will continue to go

MensRights,1614393381,After doing lots of research on the topic of circumcision and other forms of genital cutting I have identified a clear double standard that I would like to talk about and address here There are forms of FGM today that are less invasive than male circumcision such as the  ritual nick which are criminalized illegal and seen as a severe human rights violation and yet the more severe male procedure is legal and not frowned upon as such  Davis        writes      federal and state laws criminalizing genital alteration on female minors are so broad that they cover even procedures   significantly less substantial  than newborn male circumcision       a complete laissez faire attitude toward one practice coupled with total criminalization of the other runs afoul of the    free exercise   clause of the First Amendment There are also troubling implications for the constitutional requirement of   equal protection  because the laws appear to protect little girls but not little boys from religious and culturally motivated surgery   Arora et al        wrote in a paper published in  The British Journal of Medical Ethics    Male circumcision is legal in USA and tolerated in most of the world even when done by non medical practitioners in the home Yet comparable or less radical procedures in women are deemed misogynistic and human rights violations      the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics as well as WHO have labelled all forms of FGA as a human rights violation as it violates  bodily integrity in the absence of any medical benefit and victimises vulnerable girls However male circumcision is also a procedure that violates bodily integrity and up to recently was thought not to have justifiable medical benefit but was instead tolerated due to religious and cultural freedom and the lack of long term harm   Earp        also noted   There are now legally prohibited forms of medically unnecessary female genital cutting including the so called ritual nick that are   less severe  than permitted forms of medically unnecessary male and intersex genital cutting  He also writes about the differences in  khatna  which is the genital cutting procedures practiced for both sexes in Islam The male procedure is more severe and yet completely legal whereas the female procedure is criminal in all   states and treated as a  mutilation    The Bohras practice what they call  khatna  an Arabic word for circumcision  on both girls and boys within their community   In the female case  a pinch of skin is typically cut or from the clitoral hood often leaving no visible sign of alteration In the male case the entire penile foreskin is leaving an unmistakably altered sexual organ According to the ruling by Friedman discussed in the previous section the less severe female procedure is already illegal in all   states as a criminal assault It might seem then that the more severe male procedure must also be a criminal assault In fact that has been a dominant view among legal scholars who have addressed the issue since      However the male procedure continues to be treated as legal regardless of jurisdiction including in its more dangerous forms  The double standards don t stop there There is a procedure that ultra Orthodox Jews perform called  metzizah b peh which is an ancient unhygienic form of male circumcision where the  mohel  traditional circumciser tears the immature foreskin from the penile glans typically without pain control and then takes the baby s penis into his mouth to staunch the blood and supposedly  cleanse the wound This has been known to have caused many cases of herpes and led to two cases of serious brain damage and two deaths in one year alone Not only is this practice not treated as illegal it isn t even regulated City officials ultimately dropped even an informal plan to require that parents sign a consent  form   However any forms of female genital cutting including ones done in sterilized and anesthetized manners are seen as illegal and criminal   full stop   Now some might respond with something to the degree of  Circumcision has health benefits whereas FGM has none  Well the question I would ask is  If it was demonstrated that FGM had health benefits would you concede your position that it is a moral wrong  Presumably not and this is merely a moral red herring If so then you might have to be prepared to give up your view as some health benefits have also been noted for FGM in many scholarly sources For example there has been found  a lower risk of vaginal cancer  fewer infections from microbes gathering under the hood of the clitoris and protection against herpes and genital ulcers    Source      Source     Moreover at least  two studies   by Western scientists  have shown   a negative correlation between female genital cutting and HIV The authors of one of the studies both seasoned statisticians who expected to find the opposite relationship described their findings as a  significant and perplexing inverse association between reported female circumcision and HIV seropositivity  Again no one would ever consider making FGM legal on the basis of these potential prophylactic health benefits I would also like to bring to your attention something known as  cosmetic female genital cutting which typically consists of medically unnecessary procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other alterations to the female genital organs for perceived cosmesis widely practiced in Western countries and generally considered acceptable if performed with the informed consent of the individual These consist of the   same  procedures that are typically classified as FGM Given that there is overlap  or a close anatomical parallel between each form of WHO de ned  mutilation and Western style  cosmetic female genital cutting neither of which is medically necessary one must ask what the widely perceived categorical moral difference is between these two sets of procedures Controlling for clinical context varies across the two sets and is often functionally similar the most promising candidate for such a difference appears to be the   typical age   and hence   presumed    or likely consent status   of the subject But if that is correct it is not ultimately the degree of invasiveness  which ranges widely across both sets of practices  speci c tissues affected or the precise medical or non medical bene t to risk pro le of medically unnecessary  female genital cutting that is most central to determining its perceived moral acceptability Rather it is the extent to which the affected individual desires the genital cutting and can consent to it This suggests that the core of the putative rights violation is the   lack of consent  regarding a medically unnecessary intervention into one s sexual anatomy This consideration applies regardless of the sex or gender of the non consenting person Thanks for reading

MensRights,1614703389,  that is the link to the evidence that askfeminists is sexist
MensRights,1614700612,In the     s feminists attempted to create a false etymology for the phrase   rule of thumb    It was claimed that husbands used to be able to beat their wives so long as they used a stick or a whip no thicker than their thumb This is of course not true and the real etymology for the phrase comes from a practice of using the length or width of your thumb as a unit of measure You d be surprised just how many people believe this to be true though  The idea that men could legally beat their wives is a cornerstone of feminist dogma that they ve tried to push for decades  The evidence for this practice however is basically non existent  There are a couple court cases from the     s where men have seemingly gotten away with hitting their wives but it has never actually been a legal practice under US law or under English common law And even those court cases that some feminists try to cite seem fairly lackluster In one such case the husband was found innocent due to a lack of bruising or marks on his wife  Which feminists try to interpret as  it was fine so long as you didn t beat your wife too severely   Even if such a husband did get away with hitting his wife clearly it was still a crime since it was prosecuted And the reason he was found innocent came down to a lack of evidence not because there was a misogynistic loophole that he took advance of   Other court cases ruled on interpretations of English common law which is taken to help legitimize the idea that some form of wife abuse used to be legal However those court rulings consistently found insufficient evidence to justify an exception including for cases of  mild discipline of your wife   Which if anything seems like evidence against this not in favor of it Domestic violence wasn t explicitly outlawed in the US at a federal level until the early     s which is another talking point you see about this But it was still illegal at the state level going back to the     s And would have also been illegal under regular assault laws This is because there weren t any legal exceptions granted to husbands to assault their wives the way feminists like to say there were Even more damning is that wife abuse  but not husband abuse carried with it very cruel and unusual punishments throughout most of history  Under one law a husband accused of beating his wife would be buried with just his head left above the ground so that his wife could do whatever she wanted to him in retribution In fact it was actually husband abuse not wife abuse that used to be legal in history  Under some laws a wife was not only allowed to beat her husband but if she did it was used as evidence that the husband had actually done something wrong and needed to be punished  even more   The assumption is that he had to have done something to piss her off bad enough to hit him  And him making her mad but not her hitting him out of anger was deemed to be a crime  Under some versions of this law the punishment for making your wife angry enough to hit you included being drug throughout town by horses The expectation both socially and legally was that husbands were supposed to be subservient to their wives not the other way around So not only is this feminist view lacking in evidence but the very opposite of it seems to have been true   Here is a source I ve been using for this for a while       The  Great Taboo and the Role of Patriarchy in Husband and Wife Abuse   Full text   Not only does it go into the background of this controversy the authors analyzed a bunch of papers that claim that wife abuse used to be legal to show that their citation trails basically go nowhere  The only legitimate primary source is something written in the     s by Sir William Blackstone an English judge He claimed that someone told him that you could use moderate discipline on your wife at some distant point in the past but even he couldn t find a reference to it in older law books He then went on to say that such a thing would be obviously illegal in modern times  meaning in     s England   Thus apparently refuting the claim in the very source that is commonly cited as evidence for it  Modern historians have of course found no evidence for this either Like a lot of things you come across in the context of gender and gender equality I was expecting this to be fairly unknown outside of the men s community  Obviously there are academic references but just because you have sources doesn t mean it s widely known about On a whim I decided to check out Wikipedia just to see how this was handled there  And I was surprised to find that not only was this mentioned as a myth but the article itself went into a good bit of detail over the history of this revisionist claim   Clearly there s been a bit of  debate that s played out on this page given the length of discussion that s afforded to this just in the intro section  where it goes back and forth with a few feminist talking points sprinkled in here or there  But ultimately the facts have prevailed What I found interesting is just how much time energy and money feminists have put into making this seem like a legitimate fact  To quote Wikipedia  gt In the   th century public concern with the problem of domestic violence declined at first and then re emerged along with the resurgent feminist movement in the     s    The first recorded link between wife beating and the phrase  rule of thumb appeared in      in a report on domestic violence by women s rights advocate Del Martin  gt  gt For instance the common law doctrine had been modified to allow the husband  the right to whip his wife provided that he used a switch no bigger than his thumb  a rule of thumb so to speak     gt While Martin appears to have meant the phrase  rule of thumb only as a figure of speech some feminist writers treated it as a literal reference to an earlier law        The following year a book on battered women stated  gt  gt One of the reasons nineteenth century British wives were dealt with so harshly by their husbands and by their legal system was the  rule of thumb  Included in the British Common Law was a section regulating wifebeating      The new law stipulated that the reasonable instrument be only  a rod not thicker than his thumb  In other words wifebeating was legal      gt Despite this erroneous reading of the common law  which is a set of judicial principles rather than a written law with individual sections the spurious legal doctrine of the  rule of thumb was soon mentioned in a number of law journals       The myth was repeated in a     report by the United States Commission on Civil Rights on domestic abuse titled  Under the Rule of Thumb  as well as a later United States Senate report on the Violence Against Women Act     gt In the late   th century some efforts were made to discourage the phrase  rule of thumb     which was seen as taboo owing to this false origin    Patricia T O Conner former editor of the  New York Times Book Review described it as  one of the most persistent myths of political correctness     During the     s several authors wrote about the false etymology of  rule of thumb  including the conservative social critic Christina Hoff Sommers    who described its origin in a misunderstanding of Blackstone s commentary     Nonetheless the myth persisted in some legal sources into the early     s    There are other myths floating around out there as well  For example it is often said that you could beat your wife on certain days of the week or in certain locations  commonly the courthouse steps on Sunday  Despite being widely repeated and endorsed by feminists as near as I can tell that one is a myth also   So why make these efforts to rewrite history And what does it say about your ideology that you have to make things up to help legitimatize it This isn t the only area that feminists have engaged in historical revisionism  Other examples include the nature of coverture under English common law  a type of marriage  the treatment of women as literal slaves to men and of course the history of the movement itself   First wave feminism and  second wave feminism weren t actually older incarcerations of feminism Most of those people didn t call themselves feminists and they definitely wouldn t have agreed with modern feminist ideology However a great deal of time and effort has been made to appropriate their accomplishments under the banner of feminism The good news is that a lot more attention has been given to this recently  Sources are easier to come by and there have even been a couple books written by impartial historians about this  including at least one book  The Privileged Sex  where the author went in to it under the assumption that women were oppressed and was surprised to find just how incorrect of a view that is  Facts can t be hidden forever  You can try to rewrite history all you want but people are going to find the truth when they actually go looking for it

MensRights,1614852498,  This is a long post and I didn t add tl dr because I need to explain everything briefly I am sorry for no tl dr but discussing these issues are very important to understand and help men s mental issues   We all know that a man s status can differ They can be working class they can be white collar working class they can be rich or they can be middle class Yet the society not only compare men within their socio economic class but also compare men within different classes a  cross class comparement At the end the measurement will be done by looking at two things How much the men earns and how many partners they get You can achieve something great scientifically you will be headlines for once Eventually if you can t turn it into huge money or investment you will be forgotten  This is not only done by men but women also values men based on these things After all we are a society and every gender is part of the society they live in   This is a huge problem Men who can barely sustain their life plus not getting laid are suicidal Yes They feel weak worthless and complete failures Men who can sustain their life can cope a little while men who can sustain their life and get married without divorce can also cope enough Marriage is somehow viewed as a  success by society even by most progressive ones Somehow marrying resets your past mistakes and you are baptised by marriage The man gets a life long partner so he must be succesful that s one of the highest levels of success for working class men If they can manage to avoid huge debts may be buying a house with debt or mortgage get their children in school and get them jobs and marriages they will reach their peak level of success  Now of course if their children can get into middle class that will be beyond their realistic goals Anyways My point is to feel successful secure worthful and complete a men has sets of tasks given to them by society To be worthy you need to complete them Each men according to their socio economic class has different sets of tasks And all link to earning money and getting laid We all know incels or heard about them If we break down their psychology or  lonely man psychology in general we can find that most lonely man even if they are surrounded by people can t feel  complete  They lack the satisfaction We humans have an evolutionary response for loneliness or not accepted by society depression This feeling is a defence mechanism of body to stop doing acts that secludes them from society Still if you are successful at work and have a social life but can t get satisfacted for varying reasons you will feel lonely And this loneliness eventually lead to depression Yes Getting laid won t make you more men and not getting laid won t make you a lesser men I did have many partners and girlfriends but it shouldn t be the main focus of our lives I see many young men feel bad for not being able to get a girlfriend That shouldn t bother you but the system and society wants you to feel bad It is designed in that way and our one of the first struggle shall be against these norms Men shouldn t be valued by how much they earn and how many partners they can find Also we all know what this means To get more money you either need to be rich because money attracts money or you need to get in a good earning job Otherwise like if you are the clerk at McDonalds cashier you are doomed And to get partners our today s society is very  lookist  I see many men being rejected because of them being at medium or short height or not being very well looking Money can cover up all of them but if you don t have money then your look really matters The system doesn t only forces men They also make women think they are worthless unless they get the best partner for themselves Like I said before the society is not made up by a single gender and both gender are victims of this system and society This is why we all dream about a united struggle a solidarity where men and women fight for their worth and rights against the system  Now let s talk about reasons of these problems in a very summarized way   Reasons    To breakdown these reasons societal norms are not enough to explain everything The capitalistic world where there is an illusion of choice freedom and  competition  makes everything worse There is no denying that capitalism uses every method to ensure it s own safety profit and presence and has no shame into destroying lives souls and environment in the process There is no freedom of choice but we are raised to believe that we have Getting different unhealthy snacks from supermarkets is not freedom of choice We don t have freedom after all we can t get in the hermit life just like that Ensuring survival and living in harmony with nature is near impossible in today s world The most brutal truth about it was colonisation of Africa You can never be left alone in any corner of the world And finally the illusion of  competition        There is no competition We  compete with each other to be best servants of their system They don t want you to start up your own small business and live peacefully They want everything to serve in their economic mechanism that allows them to earn most and be the dominant class If you can get into their chamber you are welcome Otherwise we are all equally piece of shits and will be treated in that way We will compete with each other harm each other block each other or even plot against each other So only the ones who can serve better will rank up And most of us I mean almost none of us will be CEO of McDonalds who earns millions of dollars per year   And men are also got into the plastic surgery trap This is a market and it targeted women first They made women feel inferior and worthless when they weren t just like celebrities they presented Celebrities are one of the aristocratic establishments of capitalism Their main task is to set up the standards for society and make it look like those standards are mere average Being       It s just average They don t even get any plastic surgery    they just drink lots of water Yes they targeted women first like I said Women who felt worthless because they couldn t meet these standards of course tried plastic surgery so they could feel better It s not their fault and we should be fair about it because sometimes I see people blaming women for these stuffs It s not their fault  Now men are being targeted by this beauty market Buy products to look handsome Get your nose and chin done Get some more jawline Because outlook and money are all that matters Nothing else has any meaning in todays society and we are both slaves and consumerists of the system Thanks for reading I hope we can help our fellow brothers with their mental issues We should encourage them We should tell them that not getting laid or not earning much is totally ok They need to find things that they love in this world and get on the track Don t let the system and society ruin everything It is a fight against the world designed to make us suffer and we are all veterans of this war 
MensRights,1614851959,Also if you vote for a wave  that does not mean you agree with everything they advocated for or did  it just means you support the wave as a whole  meaning if you were there at that time  you would support it Also this isn t a feminist poll  I am a MRA  View Poll  
MensRights,1614830393,First incident was when I was    I was trying to be friendly with a kid out in public and his Mom grabbed him away and gave me the filthiest look ever  Now I know to most people that would seem like a harmless minor incident that should be ignored But think about the implication I was just labeled as a PEDOPHILE And another time was when my friend brought his girlfriend over and she d keep getting annoyed uncomfortable every time I looked in her direction And then I had to consciously divert my gaze away from her and now think about where I was looking  And I was once walking out in the street at night and this girl walking in front of me burst out into a run and starting running forwards  And during university there were a couple of girls who d actively avoid me  I once offered a seat next to me to one of them and they ignored me and walked to the other side of the classroom  All because I was an introvert who wasn t outgoing Girls don t like reserved quiet guys  unless they re Robert Pattison   I know to most people these might seem like minor harmless issues But my self esteem is nowhere near as pristine as it was when I was a   year old All of these years of   women trying to be safe   has  damaged my self esteem And I know I m not the only one a lot of men have endured this  I used to know another guy with Aspergers who would always avoid women because he was afraid of   creeping them out    
MensRights,1614825132,E Oops Male sexuality that is attracted to women in some form that is   Disclaimer   I didn t feel like making a million fucking  sarcasm quotation marks apply them as necessary while reading lol This is hypocrisy in the purest form they use old anti porn feminist arguments and logic when dealing with issues that relate to female sexualization through the male gaze and call it objectifying and dehumanizing and yet they switch over to sex positive arguments and logic when it comes to their own sexualization and self objectification insisting that it is healthy or even empowering when a woman chooses to do it regardless of the circumstances or context The issue is that those anti porn arguments are fundamentally sexist and sex negative against women they imply that women are inherently demeaned by their own sexuality relative to a male s Yet this sexist logic that concludes women are sexually inferior to men is allowed to be weaponized against us and to shame our own natural biology without implying anything negative towards women They will assert that they are being sexualized in ways that are inherently sexist that sexuality itself isn t the problem it is because we view them as sexual objects but this is nothing but bullshit assumptions A woman being objectified is seen as more harmful than a man because of the implied sexual shame for women Women were primarily valued for their looks femininity and domestic role long before the sexual revolution ever took place Now just to clarify I want to express that my issue is that they simply twist their ideology to benefit themselves at every turn I am against the ludicrous double standard that this represents I am not in favor of shaming men or women for sex just because we have different biology I want to create a more sex positive and equal society apparently much more so than feminists do Feminists want to hide behind their victim status when it is convenient and put unnecessary suffering onto men in the process I can t express how fucking insane it is that their whole theory of objectification is widely accepted despite being a mess of contradictions 
MensRights,1614804882,I don t know how I managed to last as long as I did but I ve made the decision to leave the r Feminism subreddit I was always thinking  Yeah but not all men  and often felt that I was being indirectly attacked with the broad sexist generalisations  One specific post was along the lines of  All men benefit from sexism  All men are sexist  All men unknowingly or knowingly participate in sexism Its rather humorous and mind blowing that some of them are so indoctrinated in their one sided ideology that they don t  or do realise they are perpetuating the same evil they claim they are fighting against  I wanted to learn about the oppression and struggles women face in every day life not be demonized for being a man I hope there are some subreddits that purely focus on that and not the persistent  man bashing

MensRights,1614789596,while I dont think this is an injustice or unfair it is important to men s rights and feelings  amp  x   B when boys go into puberty and start looking for more mature content they will pop into those YouTubers who do low effort Reddit videos and reaction videos but they will show off cleavage this in itself is not an issue and younger boys seeing this is also not a big deal but I feel they should understand what is happening you know that they are feeling arousal or attraction to said YouTubers but they don t know that and whether this is predatory and manipulative is another topic altogether you see I fell into this trap of not understanding why I watched these YouTubers because at the time I was watching another more interesting and understandable Reddit YouTuber who made real content I did not understand the feelings I felt towards these YouTubers and I think that that isn t good I also see my younger brother finding these YouTubers and I think that boys should have the information to understand what is happening also some personal things are happening with my brother that are very personal and I will not share even though you guys have had the same thing also mods if you don t like can you direct me to a place where the mods will like this post   amp  x   B TLDR younger boys entering puberty are attracted to female YouTubers who show off their bodies  and that s fine of course but they don t understand and they also go through personal changes they won t understand until captain hindsight tells them I feel that boys should understand these changes

MensRights,1614775195,Not sure have this happened anywhere else but here it was a thing for my understanding it did not go trough but it was far off either Actually all these crazy things have happened after meetoo campaign and i know a lot of people who are not trusting women at all any more because of this Like how it would be a crime if women regrets it After it all have happened It is not rape if she was okay with it Even i have regretted one night stands but i never have even tought about that nonsense
MensRights,1615234513,With the Formula W series where no men are allowed now becoming an official support category for Formula   I wonder what the world would think about a Formula M Series with no women allowed  In motorsports after all there is no need for a women and men only category like in other sports because the car is    of what you can do as a driver 
MensRights,1615232980,So basically I was a temp at this job and there was a woman there who seemed a little interested in me as something more than a friend I do have above average looks so I m not too unfamiliar with this happening to me But I had a girlfriend and this woman coworker of mine was   years older than me at the time and divorced Anyways I got to know her over the weeks and one day she invited me to her house for dinner I accepted because she had been very nice to me and I know she s a good cook When I got there she gave me a glass of wine which was laced with some kind of roofie that made me become something of a vegetable but still conscious After about half an hour the roofie kicked in and she started with the raping When she was done she also took what I can only assume was another roofie because she laid down on the floor and soon she was in the same state that I was A couple hours later I started being able to move fully again and I left while she was sleeping probably high as fuck  I decided not to be a pussy about that and on Monday I talked to my female boss who just sat there and smiled and sometimes giving me the  are you stupid enough to think I ll believe that  look while I told her this story I wasn t too emotionally scarred by the incident itself honestly my biggest concern was that my girlfriend might find out and dump me But after I had told my story I could tell my boss was about to start laughing but she said she would talk with my rapist about this Her office had glass walls and I was looking into that room and could see my rapist crying I though that she had been fired and that was the end of that But no I get called back into my boss s office and she locked the door when I got in Then she told me that she had called the police and that I were to wait in her office until they arrived to take me away for rape  Fast forward a bit and I m in jail and no one believed my story Not the interrogation officer not the arresting officer and not even my family and friends The only one that believed me was my girlfriend and her parents Luckily they were rich and could afford a good lawyer  I also had the luck to get a fair judge and jury who eventually gave me a non guilty verdict Now what did the rapist get who drugged me with an illegal substance before raping me A promotion and a TV interview about speaking up against rape What did I get Kicked out of my apartment fired from my job and probably have little to no hope to get a good job in the future Life of  a man everybody Never the victim   
MensRights,1615232499,In honor of international women s day I would like to post some of my conclusions following several years of research on feminism men s rights and the gender war   What group is primarily hurt by the division of men and women resulting in the fragmentation of the family It is the lower classes who depend upon the cooperation of individuals who are primarily hurt by any loss of social cohesion The more money a person has at their disposal the more insulated that individual is from the effects of social deterioration They can simply purchase what they need and throw money at any problems that come their way The less money you have the more you need the cooperation of others for survival even more so to thrive  The upper classes have a long history of using social issues to fragment the lower classes one prominent example is the widespread use of race baiting on syndicated news programs who despite any claims to the contrary serve as nothing more than mouthpieces of the ruling economic elites Multinational corporate support of feminism serves this function and any divide in the family hits at the heart of the functionality of the working class as anything more than simple wage slaves a condition that corporate interests require to maintain a philosophy of endless growth   What group benefits primarily from the division of men and women resulting in the fragmentation of the family Since the rise of feminism the average wage of the working class adjusted for inflation has stagnated  if not dropped  At the same time the productivity of multinational corporations has steadily increased to the point that certain individuals in the economic elite have as much money if not more than the federal government At the same time social programs that benefit the working class have been systematically cut things like school funding welfare programs social security and unemployment insurance  all providing valuable safety nets and resources  in order to fund systematic cuts to the taxes paid by these individuals and institutions So long as they are divided against each other along the lines of race and gender the lower classes cannot mount an effective defense against the squeeze With this ungodly wealth the elites now have at their disposal it is an easy thing to buy off the government to turn a blind eye to their enslaving usurious practices From the legalization of corruption through citizen s united to the outright theft of elections the government is now their strong arm  From this we can clearly see what feminism is an ideology co opted by multinational corporations and the economic elite to hobble the working class and strong arm them into perpetual wage slavery in order to maintain a philosophy of unlimited growth So MRA s Don t expect the government to support you Don t expect wealthy corporations to support you When you fight for men s rights you are not just fighting for men s rights but also against their will to power Expect  resistance Expect to be vilified You are what they fear most men standing in unity

MensRights,1615231190,Hello I recently posted here that I  a   year old teenager support the Mens Rights Movement I want to be more active on this subreddit and voice my opinion as the communuty here seems welcoming and isn t mad at all I support gender equality for both men and women and it s wrong that women  and men too but women do it more statisticly speaking are treated better and get away with more stuff than men Anyways my post Correct me if I m wrong but in order for a female to  produce  a man would need to fertilize the egg Without men it would be impossible to fertilize the egg and both women and men would both go extinct So why do some women hate men when we are part of the reason they exist  
MensRights,1615230345,More often than not when I point out to people that the wage gap can be almost completely explained by job choices overtime work hours etc I get told that women are forced out of work to care for children because it is what society expects of them How would you counter such an arguement If you use sources which ones would you use

MensRights,1614896742,I m new to this sub but after being severely abused by two romantic partners in my life I ve become much more personally involved with men s rights I might get into it in future posts but here s my current concern     Just now on facebook I saw a post telling us to teach men to not normalize touching women s waists as you pass them by I ve never personally done this or felt a need and of course touching someone like that shouldn t be accepted but I ve become admittedly jaded Yes I agree it shouldn t be done but the wording of the post came off as bigoted and demonizing to men I immediately thought what about all the women I ve known that say  excuse me once and then proceed to push the man out of the way before he even has time to react It s not just they they push past them they do it aggressively What I observe is that the specific women who do this enter the situation expecting to be disrespected The last time I saw this was at a bar and a man was standing talking to a group of friends The woman said excuse me and he obviously didn t hear her simple as that She perceived it as him purposefully ignoring disrespecting her and proceeded to elbow him out of the way No one said anything no one did anything They allowed it to happen and let her get away with it without consequence To me this normalizes it because the woman who got away with it leaves the situation feeling as if she s in the right because no one told her it was wrong    It s funny to me because society views men as the aggressors but in my experience most of the aggression and hostility I ve experienced has come from women Now obviously I m not saying this to diminish violence women have experienced I m simply describing something men experience and nothing more In hindsight I see men being physically pushed around a lot concerts bars and subways to name a few It s not necessarily an every day occurrence but it happens enough that I notice it and no one seems to care enough to speak out about it  Has anyone else noticed this trend I know for a fact I wouldn t appreciate being elbowed and I sure as hell am not out to disrespect anyone If I don t move it s because I didn t hear you 
MensRights,1614890763,So me and my friend had a discussion today  We focused on US and excluded third world countries as women have it worse there It was about the topic if there should also be a month dedicated to men I was on the side that there should be to not create a toxic gap between both of the genders to bring awareness to mens problems as well Whether it would be sort of awareness month or just mens history month or something of this sort My friend however said that men don t deserve this kind of a thing As they didn t suffer enough compared to women My points were divorce cases men being forced to go to war false abuse or rape accusations suicide rates or just how media don t cover as much of the problems that men face as women do Over time it went from talking about if there should be a month like that to an argument of whether men s issues are equal to female issues It got to the point where there were  sides Mine Both genders issues should be treated equally and we should aspire to solve both of them My friends We should prioritise women issues over mens I said that we should be prioritising both genders problems as postponing the other genders problems would only make society root from the inside But I guess having this opinion makes me an incel Guess we should only focus on female problems and ignore the struggles that males have to face in the current day   Take into consideration it could be biased from my side as we both got frustrated at each other that argument   So what do you think  Edit I just wanted to say this because its been stressing me today Im allowed to study online or in person I study online and my friend studies in person We had the discussion on a discord call I just don t want rumours of me being an incel spreading and me not being able to do anything

MensRights,1615236949,I know this is a small move and I will keep using other google services but I will boycott Google search engine and Chrome app because of the double standards in Woman s Day and Man s Day I understand that women s rights were more of an urgence and it was a bigger development because women were more oppressed but using double standards is nothing different from what used to happen to women  I also encourage you to take the same action with me If we start a movement we can make them hear our voice For the thousands of men being subjected to double standards in courts schools and the social life I didn t make a research about that so maybe there was already a movement like that Then please let me know about it Also it will be nice if you add any suggestions

MensRights,1615378119,Just like sperm banks changed culture and power dynamics in society so will artificial incubation when it becomes commercially available   It will give men the ability to reproduce without women and will free women up to work more and be more productive for society without wasting time with  months of pregnancy or raising kids   The result In all honesty it will be negative for both men and women but especially women we all know how utilitarian policy makers and corporate leaders can be out there   but it will be especially affect women negatively in a way that will make the middle ages look progressive   I don t think either side realizes this   but establishing true unity and true equality and equal treatment is more important now than ever   for women s sakes as much as men I feel this is going right over many people s heads on reddit and in contemporary discourse 
MensRights,1615377013,Hey lads first time caller long time listener here  As the title says I fell down a reddit rabbit hole found  r superstraight and I m interested to hear if anyone s been watching this and what thoughts they had if any I followed it for a couple of days and  whew I m happy to be off the wild ride now I think the sub has been shut down as of a few hours ago  I was just about done anyway  but must admit it was a guilty pleasure to follow and there was just  something intriguing about watching the sub devolve in a matter of days  hours  as far as I can tell For anyone out of the loop I  believe  and stand to be corrected on any of this the whole  movement is less than  weeks old It apparently was started by a Tiktok user by the name of Kyle Royce who posted about being guilted and called out by others over being attracted exclusively to women who were born female and I believe he coined the term  superstraight at that point This meant acknowledging that trans women are indeed women and that if you re a straight man you re attracted to them just as much as any other type of women by default hence the need for this new term to specify that as a heterosexual man you re only attracted to biological women and this makes you  superstraight as it were This ended up catching the guy a lot of flak and he was called out as transphobic etc  This is where I m a bit hazy on the details  I really thought the subreddit was formed as a tongue in cheek response to the  ber woke reaction calling this guy out but in essence wasn t to be taken overly seriously  they were using the abbreviation  SS for God s sake of course I thought it was a joke I saw posts calling out  superphobes and calling for superstraights to band together and unite for a greater good  it was a parody a la the Super Best Friends in South Park  there was no way this was     for real I saw it as shining a light on the ridiculousness of the extent woke culture has gone to and holding up a mirror to their cause with a  cause of their own I was into it because I genuinely don t think anyone should be given shit over who they are and aren t attracted to or who they should be  allowed be attracted to and thought the ironic shitposts and memery was an  up yours to anyone trying to guilt straight dudes telling them what to do  but also just saw it as a good time as I procrastinate on reddit  Soon it wasn t just straight dudes anymore there were superstraight girls posting  transitioning pics going from non pregnant to pregnant people posting aryan looking  super families then supergays superbis even supertrans  trans who were only attracted to trans but hey the more the merrier we re just having a good time here Lots and lots of superlesbians posting I was still assuming at this point that there was a comedic air to all of this People would post and ask if the sub was for real and of course people would respond that it was a legitimate sub keeping in line with what I thought was the spirit of the sub I even responded to one myself to assure someone that  we were legit Another time I suggested we have our own flag emojis  I said it thinking it would add an obnoxious authenticity to the movement but I think people thought it was unironically a good idea and it got something like    upvotes lol  Extremely quickly the mood on the sub changed terms like TERFs were being thrown around  Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists posts were made about trans women raping biological lesbian women by coercing them into sex under the guise of being a fellow biological woman Charity posts for women s shelters that banned trans women were posted and stickied Someone commented with a link to a men s shelter that reached the top of the post and the OP responded that their focus would be on the women s shelter for now and that they wanted to concentrate on one at a time to give people a break in between asking for donations I didn t know that the sub had become a channel for fundraising or who the OP was as an authority to tell anyone who their money should go to while disregarding the other charity but the priority was stated clearly  I m not the sharpest tool in the shed but the penny had dropped at this stage that this was something else now it looked like a hostile takeover from the remnants of the  lgb drop the t crowd trying to make their reddit comeback A quick Google and I saw a post on Ovarit from feminists who were rallied behind the superstraight cause for their own reasons but were giving a stark reminder to their own that straight dudes were appalling in general and that any allied common interest was an unfortunate coincidence They were not to join in with the memes and humour because the straight dudes didn t care enough about women s rights or radical feminism and that women could not be funny in their eyes anyway  Tl Dr  Piss takey subreddit suggesting straight guys should be allowed choose who they wanna be with in the form of memes and shitposts becomes subject of hostile takeover by radical feminists within days who enforce their own agenda astonishingly quickly and lead to the sub having a transition of its own sucking any and all fun out of it turning it into a dour political black hole for humour Men resume their rightful place as cause of all pain and suffering and are asked to fund a women s shelter shortly before the sub is driven into the ground altogether 
MensRights,1615375211,This is more of a mental health post than anything else I ve noticed that a few of the men on here get obsessed with the level of hate and inequality that gets levelled towards men and that s fair but you gotta stay away from toxic communities like the feminism ones on here and in other places In exposing yourself to all that hate every day you will be impacted by it Men please take care of yourselves Have open and honest discussion here and in other spaces that are actually interested in equality but when you go to those other forums that are only interested in female supremacy you will be shat upon from dizzying heights and I can only assume that s what you might be looking for because at this point you shouldn t be expecting that conversation to go differently You re actively seeking out people who hate you stop it just live a good life do good work and take care of your communities Toxic ideologies like feminism always die it might be popular today but a lot of hateful things used to be popular all you have to do is keep speaking up for yourself in your every day life Think of it this way a black person making an impassioned speech about racial equality at a KKK rally is stupid because no one there is interested in their views and in fact actively hates them for being black so making impassioned equality speeches and paragraphs in feminism groups is stupid because they do not care about men s rights and in fact actively hate you for being a man who loves himself Stop feeding yourselves to these wolves it s having a detrimental effect on your mental health Please take care of yourselves

MensRights,1615355820,Sorry for the format and also if is not allowed or correct but I need to share this This time surrounding the march  th protests in my country put me in a critical point  I fully support the critique against the Mexican government for the lack of actions towards violence and their misogynistic behaviour Nevertheless seeing all the hate speech shared in the social media towards men by the common folk by women that at one moment I considered friends or colleagues   All the media coverage for the protests also seeing my male friends arguing with my female friends about which gender is more  victimised and how the feminist are too violent or too extremist made me realize that the problem is not the injustice or violence from one gender to another   What I realised is that all the modern society is showing the true idea women s life is instrinsecally worthy Therefore all their problems are important worthy of attention and action to be taken  The underlying message also is Men s life is worthless men are expendable therefore their problems can be ignored as there are and there will be more men to fill the gap And that s what hurt me the most If we raise the banners to protest for men s rights that our life is worthy we will find ridicule jokes and be minimised That we should man up that is not a big deal We are treated as mere numbers in the statistics And that will be my stand point from now on Not fighting the feminist not contradicting but raising awareness on the men Issues as the feminist did But not asking for special treatment only what is fair 
MensRights,1615352589,  Note Read the whole post before you comment and dont just skim read it or you will probably miss some big and important things I have said   There are a lot of people out there especially online that say that white men rule the world and receive extra privileges because of it but I very rarely see this I have never been treated any different because Im a white dude Not in school not in public not by family or friends And I have never seen any different treatment of white males compared to other people that was helping the white men I am even to go out and say sometimes it feels like I get treated worse because I am a white male For example this post    and most of that sub If I said something like that about women unless I said it to the far right I would become twitters new poster boy to hate receive a lot of brutal comments and probably receive a death threat But she  presumably and i feel its a safe guess can make fun of a issue that a lot of men face that affects their mental and physical health with encouragement Now does the porn industry dehumanize women Yes I agree with that but it also sets unrealistic expectations for men too and I sure as hell have never seen anyone say that Theres also this post   which isnt upsetting but the comments are brutal Theres one comment that really pisses me off too because its full of lies  Because men only ever pretend to care about men s issues when they re trying to shut down conversations about women s issues  No Just no Remember when the boyscouts were shut down over the sexual abuse of boys I dont know about all men but a lot of the ones I knew were happy that something like that was being put to an end Then theres the thing that every day is mens day Im genuinely concerned here I guarantee you     the only men who agree with this are so far to the political right there wives arent allowed to speak unless spoken too and they arent the proudest examples of a man The last thing is mens mental health When women post something about depression or anxiety they are called strong and heroic  that isnt a bad thing its a fucking amazing thing but when I do it somewhere that isnt centered around mental health I see a dramatically less happy comments Ive been called weak and it hurts Im expected to be strong and emotionless in public because I am a man  The mens suicide rate is nearly  x times higher and the homeless mens population is double So I sit in bed tonight wondering is there actually any privilege for men because it doesnt seem like it Am I overlooking somethings Maybe being a little dramatic What do you think reddit   Important Note I am not trying to downplay womens or minorities issues I see that they too face hurdles in life but in my opinion  white men are facing large hurdles and  hate I do not encourage hating on anyone including the comments or the people in the post mentioned above Do not do that it is a really bad thing to do     I will try and link the post down below in the comments

MensRights,1615333636,So I just found this sub and without thinking much I hit the follow button   After looking thru some comments I ve noticed a lot of people absolutely shitting on feminists I can understand that I am guilty of that on occasion especially the extreme ones I just want you all to know that there are women out there like myself that actually have good intentions and truly just want equal rights not special treatment I do identify as a feminist for lack of a better word but I normally just show it thru actions rather than saying that out loud I may be the exception to the rule but we do exist Not quite sure if this is just a place that angry men come to bitch about women or if you all truly have good intentions as well but I find it interesting that you have such a large community here in this sub and I think it says a lot about our society and how men really feel oppressed in certain ways  Anywho if y all ever want an objective female perspective I can provide that otherwise I ll just lurk 
MensRights,1615329476,So my sisters are your classic university  liberal SJW s and whenever i m with them they will constantly be saying things like  Why are all men like that  Or  I hate men   One of my recent favourites is when one of them and I were arguing about this and she was like  You have no idea what it s like to be a woman but yet she thought it was completely fine for her to prejudge what it s like to be a man Another classic from the other one is the  Well we don t need men  She ll go on about how women could essentially just kill off all men and just use sperm to artificially impregnate people but when I hit back with well men could do that as well with eggs she was like no My main point of this is that it s really starting to annoy me and it is really isn t helpful during everything that s happened recently for myself to be constantly bombarded with  Men bad and  Kill all men  Any way I just wanted to get that off my chest for once 
MensRights,1615324241,Everyday I come on here and see more and more posts about how feminism is hurting our cause or how some dude has been charged with rape or some dude has been killed today It s honestly quite depressing to see all this This sub is now becoming more negative than positive and we are just proving our hater s assumptions about us correct with how we behave This place has become less about men s rights and combating the misandry we see on a day to day basis and more for complaining about life s frustrations We claim to have absolutely no tolerance for misogynists but there are several MGTOWs who haven t been downvoted to all hell yet Sooner or later we won t be any better than r MGTOW   amp  x   B For example take a quick look at the sidebar We have for more negative flairs than we do positive flairs A lot of them haven t even been used enough to appear on the sidebar Almost every post here are flared as either   Social Issues   Discrimination   Feminism   General Sometimes you may see a post flared as  Progress or  Humour  but those make up the vast majority Why do we call ourselves a movement if we aren t doing anything big to benefit our cause People have already disproven the wage gap feminism and even the patriarchy So if these are the major things standing in our way why do we not at least try to change it We have an already solid list of problems men face on a daily basis pinned to the sidebar as well as an even broader list in our back pockets Why do we continue talking about how hard life is when we aren t even taking the steps necessary to improve it And I know that men can t win in today s world and we d get hate from incels screaming about how misogynistic we are for being fed up of the bs we face on a daily But if we band together and protest a lot we could make this work Take the Women s Rights Movement as an example Remember all the boomers shooting them down when they started out Well they persevered and managed to succeed at their goals If they could do it so can we Maybe then we ll have less  Discrimination in our feeds and more  Activism Support and  Progress  amp  x   B So who s with me Let s get off our butts and start gaining those rights

MensRights,1615506062, Remember Freedom is the right of all sentient beings More importantly it is a privilege Many have honored it and do honor it today Some have greatly abused it Few denied it to others for various iniquitous reasons such as prejudice Whether freedom is a right or privilege no one has the right to take it away from others    Optimus Prime from Transformers  amp  x   B I m pretty sure we can all agree that that there are a lot of problems men face that women often don t have to because of gender I E Men commit suicide more often the majority of homeless people are male and so on But one thing we as men might come to think is that women are born with more entitlement than men and men have often used that to say that all women are bad But that s just simply not true Now before you tell me things like  Oh You re one of the lucky ones  or  Oh You re probably not even a real male for saying stuff like this  let me tell you a little story about myself I remember growing up in a small town in Montana and would go out of town almost every Wednesday night to go to a Christian youth group However this circle of cliquey popular girls would often tease and prank me but not on the biases of gender Instead they were teasing me because of my mental disability  being Autism  But as much as I know many females that have been like this  and even worse in some cases  I also know many females that aren t even a little like them Such as my principle who has given me many amazing opportunities to improve myself and where I am and my mom who has also done just as much as my dad to provide for me  not dissing my pops Love you dad  Also let us not forget that there are so many women out there who while speaking for women s rights have also advocated for ours like Helly Shah or Allie Stucky These brave women and more have advocated for us and risked being labeled as bigots and traitors for it At the end of the day I know there are a lot of men who have had a lot of bad experiences with women and have used those experiences to hold a grudge against all women but in my experience that s because they haven t met any women that are better Trust me there are better women out there people I think my point is we should judge people based on character and not their gender  amp  x   B  This is one of the reasons why beings like us exist We may be aliens to this planet but we still have a responsibility We have to save them from our war Even though we are strangers sometimes a stranger can be a great teacher Even a savior And perhaps soon It will be up to us to remind them of where they stand So then they have more knowledge on how to make progress as a civilization so they can finally be one with each other Like how we once were Before the Decepticons When we were peaceful and just And I promise you We will be again peaceful and just    Optimus Prime from Transformers

MensRights,1615498701,I really love my mum And normally we are able to talk about controversial issues quite well But recently I tried to have a conversation with my mum about the men in the criminal justice system I complained at a quote that said that men got away with crimes saying that was completely untrue and its a disgusting thing to say Men face significant discrimination in the criminal justice system But the problem is that my mum was a victim of domestic violence So she sees her experiences in the criminal justice system and when i challenge them I m essentially delegitimizing her experiences from her point of veiw When I have conversations with her about these things i try to avoid the subject because i know its something she went through But whenever i try to explain that I m not trying to minimise her experience by saying women also commit domestic violence she shuts down and refuses to talk I m kinda fine with this more or less because i know she s not trying to be rude or ignore me she just finds the conversation hard But for me it really sucks cause I m not trying to make my mum feel like any less of a victim but i don t see the harm in having more people know things about mra I also hate leaving things unsaid Like this is something in really believe in and we can disagree but i want to at least be able to have a conversation with my mum about this especially considering we never really talk about it as a family IDK maybe i brought it up in the wrong setting I just really want to have the conversation in general and i think it would be hard if every time I say something it comes off as I m either delegitimising her experiences or am just not listening

MensRights,1615486206,    Have you ever wondered why you could put everything into a relationship with a woman and still have her disrespect you Why is it that women look fondly and respect men that have no respect for them Find out what the  Female Chakra tells us about women s behaviors around men that help them versus men that crave women to do for them 
MensRights,1615485734,So just take a breath Put down the phone for a while Social media is not a reflection on the truth A savvy loaded Instagram story is not a reflection of the truth All the girl s on your timeline being temporarily feudal against the entire male sex is not a reflection of the truth It can feel hostile right now Between IWD and the death of Sarah Everard people want answers A carte blanche ultimatum to men to  step up their game is not a reflection on how you act towards women or anyone else It can also be sickening when it s posted by a woman who has caused you anguish in the past Again it s not a reflection on the truth it s just optics from people who want attention Or who want to empower themselves because they as individuals have not done enough to empower themselves It s a really charged time so don t forget to look after your head Get sleep get a walk in do something productive in the fresh air It ll all pass 
MensRights,1615483747,I don t know if you guys know but in the UK literally in the last few days a news headline has blow up over the disappearance and murder of a women named Sarah Everard The reason I bring this up is let s be honest if it was a man who disappeared or was murdered nobody would care and it wouldn t break local news let alone national news Not only that but it was apparently done by a male police officer and yet again the feminists are at it saying how women are too afraid to go out at night I saw one post on Twitter that was a rant about this and it got over    k likes with people agreeing women are being hurt Even tho men are the largest victims of violent crime Clearly this is discrimination Of course it s bad she was murdered no doubt by the bias and blaming of men is absurd   Link to article   
MensRights,1615481894,Can t help but laugh at the irony You preach that  no means no  but that didn t stop you from shoving your hands down my pants despite my protests You laughed as you took off your clothes and forced yourself on me You claim to have been too drunk to remember but I know you wouldn t accept that excuse from a man The crazy thing is I m on your side I consider myself a feminist I m a firm proponent of equal rights No woman should feel afraid for her safety when walking down the street at night In a way this has helped me understand your struggle even more That was the most powerless I have ever felt despite being strong enough to repeatedly push you off me But I let you escape with your dignity I didn t tell our friends what you had done It s a slap in the face for you to come out and post this when I know you don t uphold those values yourself  The thing about equality is it s a two way street Take a look in the mirror before you post something so hypocritical 
MensRights,1615475444,In the UK at the moment the disappearance of Sarah Everard has been a huge talking point This has led to discussions on twitter and other social media outlets over women s safety One of the most common points raised by women on this issue that I ve always struggled with is  Men need to hold other men accountable for their abusive behaviour and I ve never figured out what they mean by this and how to tackle this particular point Where have women gotten the idea that these awful rapists murderers and violent men are sharing the information of their crimes with their friends  If they have any the majority of the time the more serious ones are loners How can we convince women that we are just as clueless as to who in particular we need to be calling out The second dilemma I ve got is the safety at night thing All people  Particularly in a city should be wary at night I went to Uni in Southampton and I always made sure I was walking home with someone at night or on the phone to someone the whole way home I ve never thought it was a gendered issue it s just what I ve been raised to do to stay safe in fact it s what my Mother insisted I do I would really appreciate some insight or advice into this topic 
MensRights,1615471055,I ll start by saying that I m sorry for failing you guys I should have known better or expected less I didn t get a lawyers help because I didn t want much just for the curriculum to be changed for the sexual assault talks Basically I told them what happened and they said the new administration is different and that they already do the things I say So basically they aren t going to do anything and it was all a waste of time  I m sorry for letting everyone here down I guess I was too stupid to expect to get results with my lack of help or expect something good to come out of this

MensRights,1615424349,I m honestly too sick after hearing this to write anymore If you want to hear for yourself the link is below Maybe I passed over it but I couldn t find the original post in AITA or I d provide the link to that too I need to lay down  
MensRights,1615421687,  do you have the glasses from my last post keep them on    Heterosexual men always have and always will despise women      well uh thats a bold statement switch the genders and that sounds like what an incel would say  It is because they cannot both respect us and be sexually attracted to us those things are always mutually exclusive    you can respect someone and find them hot  Their brain just somehow functions so that what they re attracted to sexually always has to be less than    thats not how it works   nobody sees their significant other as less than or their suboordinate they see them as idk a   significant other     Heck the whole Madonna whore complex is a great example of this mindset As soon as a woman becomes something he might even respect a little bit  she s still just an object to him now gone from sexual to motherly  the sexual attraction disappears    we dont see you as objects you ve been on IncelsWithoutHate   you can be attracted to someone you respect  chances are if we dont like you we dont respect you no matter how highly you think of yourself you can be however attractive but with a personality like that we dont respect you if anything you re  objectified when we no longer respect you  we might not like your personality but we like your body  but if we respect you too thats not the case  If a man is sexually attracted to women he just simply cannot see us as actual human beings    we recognize you as actual human beings   like I know you re a real person behind Mutteriman   I dont think I d like you but I know you exist   and there are various girls who I ve been equals  even suboordinate  to and attracted to   both romantically and sexually     It has something to do with power just think about how much some many men hate homosexual men especially the ones who are more submissive and feminine    we dont hate gay people   we just don t respect those who dress as a clown   and before you call me out  I mean those who literally look like a clown   RuPaul is fine he s just looking feminine   but the netflix thumbnail for his show has a literal guy with the clown hair and the white powder and all that  They aren t  men anymore and hence not human To men a person cannot be respected if he she is in a receiving end sexually    to you maybe  What makes this all so sad is that women are not like that at all We ve loved men and women all over the world continue to love them in such an innocent and pure way We believe in romance and deep emotional connections We are capable of seeing them as more than just objects    bruh really insulted half the human race and explains how the other half is perfect  We can have male friends but  heterosexual men can not fathom the idea of being friends with women that would mean they d have to see us as actual human beings first    just because none of your male friends dont want to be around you doesnt mean they objectify you because you re female   I assure you its an attitude problem the same way how incels arent rejected cause they re short  misogyny is bad for getting girls  They always want to benefit somehow    sex isnt neccesarily a perk though  Some might argue that there are so many gold diggers and shallow women but it s really men who have made us that way We ve been taught to be dependent on men We ve been taught that only our looks and youth matter How can men complain about a system they created    you   literally have an entire guide  that states men will immediately leave you if you arent perfect     A LITERAL FDS HANDBOOK THAT SAYS THAT      AND IT USES THE SAME WORDS INCELS USE LIKE  a becky and  a chad I SWEAR  anyway have a good one edit but its not an actual edit was abt to submit and I got  your post needs flair  and I remembered to highlight a reply     you are making the problem      she is saying that if he wants to fuck its fine      and you are jumping and saying it means he disrespects her  wanting to have sex does not mean we cant respect you
MensRights,1615420268,    Context     the post in question in and of itself  dishonesty in a relationship is a reasonable issue   the response however is not     put on your glasses you ll need them   gt TLDR Being a working woman is the goal because if you have your own money you can leave SAHM is a precarious position and risky A HVM can turn low value after       or   years So you should always be financially stable of your own accord  okay this is literally saying you should be a career woman so you can leave marriage   right off the bat    gt Majority of women who stay in abusive relationships do so because they do not have the financial ability to support themselves alone especially if they have children Case in point above  alright this is true and to be fair thats a serious issue    gt There also doesn t even have to be abuse You could wake up one day and realize you have now become a  mommy bangmaid or just plain old realize this is not the life you desire and newsflash you need money to leave   he doesnt have to do anything you can decide that you re a mother who takes care of the house or realize you just dont like working and leave   this is literal irresponsibility and   exactly  what deadbeat dads do  they decide they dont wanna rise to being a father and just leave you cant just decide you dont want to be a mother and walk off    gt Some women on FDS say that if you want to be a SAHM you should have a rock solid prenup passive income before marriage have a stash sufficient for your possible escape    gt    gt Bullshit that is not enough    gt    gt Firstly that isn t even realistic for most women since majority of households in America need two incomes to survive In           of all household in America were  dual income      gt    gt Secondly a woman would need enough money to not just sustain her during a divorce but for a few years after Losing out on career advantages and progress derails financial stability She will need extra time to either go back to school or work her way up the ladder to a wage until she reaches a median salary for the country    gt    gt Not to mention no one wants to employ someone with a   year gap on their resume and if they do happen to get hired it s for well below the average salary It s been proven statistically that  divorced women are significantly poorer than their married counterparts   And while women s livelihood   decreases  after a divorce men s livelihood   increases  after a divorce    gt    gt Thirdly even a HVM is not going to sign a  rock hard prenup that will entitle his female partner to    of all assets But I ll bite Who s to say in the culmination of a divorce that he won t hide assets or properties What will you do if your HVM is no longer a HVM and pulls LVM moves A HVM can turn low value after       or   years The person you marry is not the same person you divorce true   you need money to leave  gt   Thirdly even a HVM is not going to sign a  rock hard prenup that will entitle his female partner to    of all assets  because its      this literally isnt even equality or maybe       since hes asking you to marry him this is outright stupid  gt Clearly being a stay at home mother isn t working out in our favor no matter how many women    desperately   want to stick to this traditional ideal  did someone say   our       again working as a class does not help individuals  individualism is why some are better off than others and you must accept that   gt The  only way this would work is    if you come from a well off family that provided you with a padded trust fund    you are highly educated in a lucrative easily employable career  doctor orthodontist optometrist etc  or    your husband gives you half of every paycheck    gt    gt If this isn t you don t be a SAHM if your parents give you money if you re a doctor or your husband gives you      off every dollar he makes otherwise dont be a stay at home mother   bRuH   alr rant complete
MensRights,1615412961,we all know how feminism wants to claim women are so  objectified and all that and they want to say men are privileged and it s a man s world stuff like that they will say they re objectified while we get drafted in wars because we are literally considered disposable and they ll say they re objectified after leaving a disaster first because of  women and children  since men are literally considered disposable they ll say we are privileged despite nothing being truly catered to us I get that feminism has some valid points as does  meninism  I mostly advocate for egalitarianism over feminism or  meninism but that s besides the point  point is everybody in society views men especially white men as  privileged scum pos  because society views us as so privileged they actively ignore anything truly wrong with how society treats us and hates us for being so  privileged when arguably women are more privileged imo but even then the whole concept of  privilege is silly I never have ever called someone  privileged and as a whole I dont think anybody is really truly  privileged in society unless you re a filthy rich corrupted elite  Anyway the only people who will care about you are other men men are supposed to be the care giver and anything that they deal with they re just told to man up or whatever you re expected to care for others when others arent expected to care for you even then most men wont care about you either most men only care about women either for relationship purposes or to try to get sex or whatever but really go around saying  I m a man and depressed or  my wife abused me  and see how little anybody cares  ever since I made close friends with my  bros I ve felt so much happier since I always had girl friends beforehand I never had to worry about if this new girl I met was trying to manipulate me into sex by saying she loved me and leaving after or how a girl friend is complaining about how privileged I am and how much she  hates all men  I just can play video games with my bros and it s a genuine experience not that I didnt hsve good experiences with girl friends but it s just such a different thing  bros better ourselves for each other because honestly  nobody else cares never had to worry about a friend of months years blocking me for having a different opinion when they all can just talk about it and even if they disagree it s fine because we are bros and we dont let that shit get to us it s just much more genuine

MensRights,1615400894,I am aware of this sub s rule about mentioning activity in other sub reddits but what happened to me in another sub is a reflection of what is happening to me in real life too In a sub that discusses moral issues I posted my opinion about abortion My post was more in the form of a question as I am still unsure about how I feel about abortion I was immediately attacked by dozens of people and I was downvoted into oblivion I do not mind being downvoted as long as the person who downvotes me also explains why they disagree with me  But many people kept telling me that since I am a man I am not allowed to have an opinion about what  women do with their bodies  As always I was polite in my replies and I did not even react when insulted in the most vicious and personal way They went so far as to say that a fetus is just a parasite To my surprise a day later I was banned from the sub but I received a message from the moderators telling me that I had to apologise for being a bigot and for trolling I decided to humour them and I apologised They kept asking me to apologise again Eventually they told me to send them no more messages What is so shocking is that it has become acceptable for men to be denied from expressing their opinion let alone having a say in any action that involves women  In the case of abortion men should also have a say If a woman decides to abort a child I have had with her I think that my views should have some weight too 
MensRights,1615574854,Men have to serve  years mandatory in the Israeli military while women only have to serve  years This is neither fair nor right for women Either decrease the years of mandatory service for men or increase them for women Otherwise give women less rights in other areas if you are cutting male rights in military service Women can t say they want equal rights and then go back and defend policies like this 
MensRights,1615565312,I am currently writing a masters thesis on impulsivity and emotional regulation a process underlying practically all mental illness and I believe there are some important parallels to be drawn between these processes and the current climate of proposed female vulnerability that I think is worth sharing  It is first important to understand that we are machines constantly recognising environmental cues These cues e g the sound of running water or the smell of a fast food joint guide us toward beneficial resources such as food and water Furthermore cues such as the howl of a wolf guide us away from potential threats Our dopaminergic reward system plays a really important role in regulating our behaviour directed toward these cues Take the example of smelling the fast food joint the irresistible familiar smell guides you through the door and drives to purchase the divine greasy treat Subconsciously your brain has observed a cue and predicted a reward based on your previous behaviour toward the cue Due to your brain s correct prediction of the reward it releases a large amount of dopamine to help you remember your response  buying the burger is a beneficial reaction to the cue On the flipside not buying a burger is likely to make you a bit sad as your brain incorrectly predicted the response to the cue and less dopamine than expected is released  Impulsive disorders such as OCD substance and behavioural addictions all stem from maladaptive responses to cues In other words a cue may have a much more substantial effect on cognition than it deserves You can think of this as the snap of an opening can of lager to an alcoholic an otherwise normal cue that is now tied to intense craving of alcohol  What has this got to do with women and their perception of safety Well being the plastic malleable creatures we are our response to environmental cues can be learned from others Most of us know to steer clear of a rattle snake without having any prior experience of its bite This is the issue The continuous conversation about female safety has taught many young women to recognise men as a cue  especially in the presence of other cues such as the time of day that something horrible will happen to them This leads to maladaptive responses to the cue such as crossing the road calling a friend or getting in a taxi that results in you guessed it  Nothing The fact that nothing happens results in a nice dose of dopamine reaffirming their response to the cue no matter how unnecessary it was Why is this a problem Men are unfairly being associated with horrible people and are being mass generalised as such This is damaging not only for men but for the women who are conditioned into thinking that any man is after them The only way we can counter this is through education In a twist of narrative I believe it is now time not to have a conversation with your son about how to make women feel safe but to educate feminists and others  men and women alike who perpetuate a notion of constant murder and abuse toward women It was never men telling women to be vigilant dress a certain way or avoid the streets at night that fearmongering came from within the feminist community that constantly reduces women to nothing more than perpetual victims 
MensRights,1615561805,I have been seeing ALOT more of these on some girls I follow on Instagram adding to their story talking about how afraid they are of walking out at night because of men is there something that has happened because the amount more this has been showing up for the last day or two can t be a coincidence   
MensRights,1615560895,There s a new ad on the local radio that is advertising conjugal violence In it a men is saying that he has prepared her favorite meal after a week of going through her phone messages calling her names insulting her friends and so on Then at the end the announcer says  Report violence against women  I mean my wife does and says worst things to me on a daily basis Even my therapist told me recently that I m in an abusive relationship based on what I shared with her However if I was to report it it would probably back fire and I would be the one being scrutinized and punished  I m just tired of this inequality and I m scared about my son s future in this sick feminist world 
MensRights,1615559482,Metropolitan police had suggested women don t walk alone at night until the killer is found Your usual army of  activists have taken this as an attack on their rights and have replied with an barrage of abuse at men  Dangerous people exist I myself have been attacked walking home in the UK These killers and abusers aren t going to listen to someone saying  don t rape  The idea that they take advice of personal safety  respinsomsibility as an attack but then put the blame of one individual on  billion men is insane  Also on twitter a  CURFEW FOR MEN has been suggested amongst the usual of us having to cross the road when walking near them to ensure their optimal comfort These women hate men so much they would prefer men not to exist purely so they feel a smidgen safer when walking home 
MensRights,1615557091,I know there s some very anti female  anti feminist feelings in this sub and there s a lot going on to justify those sentiments But I moderate a new platform that s dedicated to TRADITIONALISM  ie The nuclear family   So what I m asking is what should I incorporate for men s issues   Should it be a section on feminist rhetoric hatred against men or just something to discuss the daily challenges men face in this age I m very much open to suggestions and truly appreciate the feedback 
MensRights,1615535675,I m curious to hear what other people here think about the new  TooManyWomen hashtag that s trending It seems that people have gotten sick of the  not all men responses that inevitably show up when women s issues are being discussed due to the inevitable  all men are dangerous type of language that tends to be used when sexual harrassment and rape are being discussed In order to avoid that they ve shifted to saying  too many women  as in too many women have been harrassed assaulted and raped Too many women face these problems on a regular basis for the problem to be ignored too many women get harrassed on a regular basis to stay silent about it At first glance it seems to be a great idea it addresses the real and serious problems that women face without condemning every man for it and should help the discussions not devolve into the usual men vs women arguments 
MensRights,1615532162,  Some quotes  Boys are more likely than girls to die in their second decade of life    But even more troubling Blum s team  found   that boys suffered higher levels of physical violence neglect and sexual abuse by adults than girls   In  one study   of       children age   and younger three quarters of the boys who reported being sexually victimized said the person who violated them was another child    In a little more than half those assaults the violator was a girl      The overwhelming majority of male rape victims say that the person who violated them was another male but    most male victims of other kinds of sexual violence say they were violated by a female      When we convey to boys that unwanted touch is a serious issue of sexual assault only when it affects girls and not when it affects boys we are sending a message that only girls bodies are worthy of protection   As the trial approached lawyers representing the school board asked the judge to prohibit Martin s legal team from using certain terms in front of a jury rape aggravated rape sexual battery sexual assault  Finally a real gem  Lara Stemple    told me that her efforts to bring attention to male victims  and to the surprisingly high rates of female perpetration of such violence  have at times triggered false accusations that she is aligned with men s rights activists who are known for anti feminist and misogynistic language and ideology  Even in an article about sexual violence against boys MRAs are  misogynists  God forbid aligning with them That s the Washington Post to you 
MensRights,1615513646,I think the original text was written by feminists demanding all men change their behaviour to suit their irrational feelz and fears but what shocks me is how bad things have gotten that seemingly sensible men are now so cowed and beaten over the head with feminist lies everyday that they too also believe we should have to behave differently in a discriminatory way just because of our gender Seems a sad number of men are now becoming the white knight propaganda filled self loathing cucks we knew feminism would make them

MensRights,1615511728,I think it would be more accurate to say men AND women are responsible for shaping social norms Of course they re also subject to social norms which will affect their role in shaping them In times of societal change you will always find those who struggle with the new societal demands Here it seems that society is trying to shift away from sexism Consequently we re seeing a lot of people struggling with change Some object to this change and are frustrated to discover that rejecting emerging norms does not foreclose their effects So I think we re seeing attitudes and behaviors reflecting this frustration Frustration is understandable It s also confusing because the source is not always clear I sympathize with frustration but we can t lose sight of the real issue Is it reasonable for women to want a less sexist society and are women using reasonable means to pursue one Those who disagree with the first question will not accept any answer to the second one And I think this is how social change always leaves some people behind Those who simply cannot concede the reasonableness of pursuing social justice ultimately reject all methods of doing so But this doesn t prevent changes from affecting them so frustration naturally follows And though I sympathize with frustration that doesn t really change anything Pursuit of a reasonable and necessary social goal justifies the frustration it inevitably creates Would it really make sense to prioritize things the other way

MensRights,1615509550,I hate the idea that we live in a patriarchy and men have life so fine and dandy However i really struggle to find remember where the data is that shows things like suicide rate in men compared to women how men are more likely to get arrested and then get a longer sentence for committing the same crime how in the UK  i think a woman LEGALLY cannot rape a man  I am from the UK so if anyone has any good studies or articles about these points could you put them below  Thanks 
MensRights,1615652962,Not once have I ever seen any man  or any woman claim something to the effect of  She was wearing that revealing halter top therefore it serves her right that she got raped   Not one person  Ever  Yet I keep seeing this supposed rebuttal of  not asking for it    Granted my personal experiences are not the sum of all knowledge so I wanted to put this out there  Has anyone here ever actually encountered a person who has claimed that a woman deserved to get raped because of the clothes she was wearing or because she went to some party in a bad area of town or whatever  If there actually is someone making claims like that I m totally opposed to them of course  But I suspect this isn t a real thing but rather a straw man   However if you have encountered this type of attitude do speak up  I m curious 
MensRights,1615651618,I find this extremely bizzare because mensrights movement are not every one i know supports womens rights as much as mens I dont see mensright activists starting trends like KillAllMen TooManyMen CurvewForMen etc We seem to be more polite we seem to do more research and suggest actual changes we are not shouting how future is female we think future is all of us The fact that we point out equalaty problems men and boys face do not make us misogynists it means we are fighting for rights that belongs to everyone Feminists instead have only misandry towards men they dont even feel bad when little boys have tough times etc Mensrights movement seems to be the only movement who wants real equality not supermacy 
MensRights,1615646914,Anybody who s used tiktok will know what I m speaking of Lately I ve been seeing a lot of people generalise men with  We don t know which men are good which is why we say All men  and so many people are spreading statistics that at best are questionable This subreddit highlights a lot of big issues but I think we need to start doing more We should have a pinned thread dedicated to killing misinformation surrounding men and link changes that need to be made to fix many of the issues men face today  For example women can t be charged with rape in the UK women who force men to have sex with them aren t legally rapists family court issues paternity allowances the lack of support for male domestic violence victims the lack of funding towards suicide prevention for men the high rates of suicide amongst men amongst many other issues We need to combat the hate speech against men on whatever platform you see it on and the best way we can do that is with facts and statistics highlighting the issues and pointing out flaws in the arguments used to support the hate speech that is being said I highly doubt governments will talk about this evident issue so I think its important that we work to fix it ourselves Yes having a subreddit is good but we need to do more if we want a change  In Britain a petition with        signatures is brought before parliament If we could get even just  of these petitions to that number we will have done a lot for the cause

MensRights,1615640422,There seems to be bit of a misconception with this case being taken out of context  too seriously She has explained later that the proposal was not  entirely serious  more so suggesting is as a point of hypocrisy in victim blaming circles with ideas of  preventative measures where women have been advised to act on a sort of natural curfew themselves to keep them safe  This isn t some legitimate attempt to suppress men it s someone highlighting a presumed double standard a fear instilled curfew for women is tolerated but a curfew for men isn t Treating this seriously is counterproductive it would be much more helpful to focus on more genuine issues rather than let a non serious attempt to point out a double standard dominate the conversation  Using this point to devalue the current situation or as a demonstration of extreme views isn t effective there are many other better talking points you could use rather than recycling something people aren t taking seriously anyway
MensRights,1615639935,I feel like this is a very real topic because it s so called incel ideology People like to insult men for not having sex but it s actually risky to have sex nowadays for men because women can falsely accuse us of rape falsely claim that we got her pregnant or even falsely claim that we abuse them A lot of young men feel like losers because they are virgins because society acts like the more sex you have the better person you are  I m a virgin at   yo I would say I m a good guy but then I ll get labelled as a  nice guy but because I m shorter than  ft women don t care about me but it s okay I ll work on myself Retire early if I can I m not spending money that I can grow in the market on women using me or possibly exploiting me Anyways for any good guys out there when these women are    no kids divorced with kids they ll look for you Don t fall into the trap of raising kids that are not yours if women can pick their mates you can too just do it better

MensRights,1615600864,Apologies for posting a second time about the same article    But a comment to my previous post   Even the Washington Post admits female predation of boys and men  prompted me to quote the end of the last paragraph in full  I noticed my own knee jerk resistance to the reality that unwanted sexual contact can traumatize boys just as it does girls  and to the reality that it can  matter just as much to them Deep down somewhere under my skin I was holding on to some seriously wrongheaded assumptions  ideas so ingrained I did not even notice them ideas that rendered    boys as something less than human     Now if women like the author of this article are capable of  rendering boys     children     as subhuman then what do you think they think of men Less than dogs perhaps 
MensRights,1615599336,Interesting tidbit that got buried deep into page   of the report   gt While our initial analysis of overall rates of self reported harassment and assault behaviors showed that perpetration did not differ in statistically significant ways by the gender of the respondent this equivalence altered upon removal of the  sexist slurs item from our definition of harassment Upon removal of this variable we see a marginally statistically significant trend suggesting that men are more likely to engage in behaviors of sexual harassment and assault as compared to women     of men vs    of women p          It s interesting that they try to also cherry pick out the  sexist comments part so that they could twist the numbers against men However even with their cherrypicking they acknowledge a p value of       which as anyone who has ever taken a stats course could tell you means that the difference is not statistically significant with a standard significance level of      So in the end they failed to find that harassment and assault is a gendered offense in terms of perpetration  I have a feeling that this little hidden nugget of information won t be featured in any media articles or stopstreetharassment org articles anytime soon 
MensRights,1615596063,Today I decided as one of the complaints of us MRA s is a lack of shelters for men to lodge a Freedom of Information request with the Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government  The aim of this is to see if there is a disparity in funding using information readily available on the proportion of men to women living on the streets and creating a mean cost per man and woman on the street to decide if there is an existent disparity between funding provided for both  This is short as I have just lodged the request however we will be able to answer the question in at most   days time 
MensRights,1615593892,That s a pretty tame headline in reference to multiple rapes of a minor  It s even pretty tame for the crimes she was actually convicted of   First degree sexual assault sounds a lot more serious than just the generic sexual abuse   At least she faces serious time 
MensRights,1615589828,I m seeing on all the major newspapers the BBC SKY news the guardian etc as well as Instagram posts getting a hundreds of thousands of likes How is this possible    would mean   out of every hundred women you meet has been sexually harassed which is without a doubt absolute bullshit Even in the least developed countries it would not be     It seems to be intentionally exaggerated figured to present men as a distant fiendish and out of control specie 
MensRights,1615588842,But I wanted to say I am a huge supporter of this sub and of men s rights I ended up in a heated debate on Twitter with some so called  feminists today because of the recent murder in the UK and it solidified even more within me that men get such a bad rap for things that women are just as capable of Their responses were absolutely diabolical and when I pointed out the    rise in female paedophilia and examples of where women have been allowed to get away with things such as assault    times with no jail time   they had no response other than  But look how they treat us I won t tell you what my response to that was but it wasn t nice  I ve seen the damage women do to men firsthand Please know that there are women out there that see the raw deals you get and we support you

MensRights,1615588598,This is just new theory I ve been thinking upon and wanted to get some feed back While we do have our extreme sexist people on both end of the spectrum my focus is on the people in the middle of the bell curve Most people in this group are they really sexist or are they selfish If their gender were all of a sudden changed would they still believing in the same things as they did before or would they switch sides to whatever that would serve their needs  amp be most beneficial to them  I started thinking more about this since I ve been seeing the  Notallmen tag  And I m a guy who had been harassed by females before but didn t really speak up on it because men just shrug it off  Quite recently I invited a girl over  amp she wanted to have sex I was into her but didn t feel like having sex so I made sure I was drunk that it was whiskey D She kept trying to push us to have sex the entire night and ran around flashing on me  amp doing things to provoke me I kept thinking that this is weird Switch roles I d be in trouble She apologized to me the next day The moral of the situations that I ve been in  amp  Notallmen is that  this is more of a power dynamic If women had the power they d be doing the same  amp I ve experienced this first hand I m not submissive guy at all but I ve been groped on first dates hit on my face on first dates  in a flirty manner but I don t like it  pressured for intercourse If women had more power and physical prowess we would see more of this across the board Which kind of brings back to my main point that this is more of a power dynamic to the vast majority of people  amp individuals being selfish Open to thoughts

MensRights,1615723095,So I saw a twitter post today with a few thousand likes and it was talking about how Gay men are included when women say   we don t feel safe around men  The OP then went on to reference her being harassed by gay men  which is valid and is an issue that should be talked about   However she then went on to say that gay men still have male privilege and well   um   Let me just quote it  Y all have still grown up with male privilege you ve been socialised to believe you re more important and have more power than us and that doesn t go away because you suck dick lol  Now I would really like you to tell me how I a gay guy was socialised to believe I m more important than women Was it the feeling of estrangement in school cause I grew up feeling isolated from everyone cause I was  weird and different    Was it me thinking there was something wrong with me Oh no it was definitely having no male friends right I think it shows that people will bring  male privilege into an argument to make them sound like they re being reasonable but they re not when they clearly haven t thought about who actually has the privilege The only people with male privilege are the privileged Joe from down the street who s a plumber isn t privileged The CEO of a company is actually privileged Rich privileged people have the upper hand in society they have influence your average dad doesn t  This is my first post here so it s probably not well thought out or anything I just felt confused as to why someone would make a post that was causing man hating against the people who are meant to be your allies Also many gay men in the comments spoke about their experiences with being harassed by straight women and guess what They got attacked dismissed and hated on How can one claim men are privileged and then go on to dismiss someone s harassment purely based on the fact he s a man

MensRights,1615692675, I am unsure if this is the proper tag but if it is not then I am sorry and would hope that the admins correct me instead of deleting my post So I saw a new post from TheTinMen and it got me thinking about the tragic case of Emmett Till What if feminism is in some ways another lever that can be or is used to reinforce white supremacy systemic racism and police brutality  Think about it By breeding distrust of men and avoidance of them you create or influence stereotypes that they are dangerous If you create that stereotype of dangerous men you potentially create a criminal bias against them especially towards men of color This bias impacts average people law enforcement and the courts who will treat false allegations as truth and proceed accordingly After all that s essentially what happened to Emmett Till He was falsely accused by a woman and the men who murdered him got off because they believed they were serving justice to a  perpetrator  We see this now with the curfew in the UK false rape allegations on college campuses and so on Apologies if this came off as incoherent Just figured I d create some discussion on the topic and wanted to see if I m wrong because I feel like I m not 
MensRights,1615692592,When people hear I m a MRA people think that Means I am a racist sexist bigoted and incel I don t believe that to be true for me or for anyone here What I think MRA means is calling out what feminists believe to be true and to call out the bad things that they do in the guise of  social justice   The reason I joined MRA was because I began to understand the harm that feminism is doing on young boys and how it is just wrong that men are being treated unfairly in family court school and society in general I came to this realization in high school when I had a teacher give all of her attention to the girls in the class to help them succeed and punish the boys with extra homework and an unfair grading standard I didn t realize at first but later in the term I figured it out as it seemed that we had to do more work for no extra reward and it just seemed weird that my female classmates loved her but my male classmates and I absolutely HATED her It came down to her projecting her home life on the students I am now almost out of college so it was a long time since then but I still remember it like it was yesterday  It is just shitty that women are allowed and encouraged to be sexist and racist and just down right psycho but if a man does any of that it is a crime in the public court I just love reading tweets calling to  kill all men or to  teach men to be better  If I replaced man with woman I would be dragged all over the internet and my life would be absolutely ruined I have seen it happen with many people even men I know For example a friend let s call him John went to a party with some really popular girls and proceeded to hook up with one of them will call Jane After the party Jane regretted sleeping with him and wished she didn t Her friends told her that she could claim it was rape and encouraged her to report him to the school Luckily for John she never went through with it as she knew that it was consensual She told that to her friends and they said that if she didn t report him they would First of all it is extremely inappropriate to tell someone what they want when it isn t even true So the friend who will call Amy told the school that John raped her friend Jane and she wanted to tell you but felt she couldn t Again John got lucky that Jane told the school and the police that she didn t say that and that John didn t rape her and it was consensual Why do I mention this Because it is just one of the many ways that feminists hurt us guys and that it would be so wrong for a man to do  I simply don t understand how people think that it is ok to be sexist to men and racist towards white people as if reverse racism isn t real It just sickens me to see society turn its back towards men Judge not by the sex of the person but by the content of their character

MensRights,1615670935,I wanted to share this story I created a throwaway account because I don t trust putting this on my main account I live in the U K where in the news there s been stories of the tragic murder of a woman  Anyway my girlfriend who lives with me ordered some baking supplies from a local shop as she was making a cake for Mother s Day for her mum in our coronavirus bubble she asked me to pick them up this evening I got in my car to the bakers shop to pick up the yeast and some fresh flour and pay for them Inside the bakers shop was two women who work there it was dark outside at this time I enter the shop and said I came to pick up an order for my GF placed One of the women looked at me and spoke to the other women and whispered one of the women went out the back and I was expecting her to bring the stuff we ordered so I could pay and leave  But I was kinda shocked when the other woman told me that she wouldn t serve me as her friend who was now at the back of the shop didn t feel comfortable with me there due to my  over bearing masculine presence and said they d call the police if I didn t leave I respected their decision and left as I was more afraid at this point they may make up I did something when I never I have no idea what I did wrong I m a rather tall and fat male but I did nothing to make them feel unsafe at all My girlfriend was furious and called the owner as she knows them  a couple who deeply apologised and said the younger girl was new and with everything going on in the news it s to be expected  I guess no harm done but this is the first and hopefully last time I was refused service because I presume of my gender My girlfriend is still furious Edit for anyone wondering I went to Morrison s instead and the lovely baker guy there gave me some fresh yeast for free and bought some flour

MensRights,1615661392,tl dr Against popular opinion men more likely to be killed walking down the street men get sexually harassed too many posts on social media in the UK atm is a false and dangerous narrative calling for curfews for men and for men to  teach their sons yet this is baseless slander  amp  x   B Recently a woman by the name of Sarah Everard went missing a week later her body was found and a UK Policeman has been arrested for her murder This is a horrible situation and I hope the guy who did it rots in jail Following this there has been a massive campaign over social media and the media claiming statistics such as    of women have been sexually harassed and that there should be a curfew for men and that men need to teach their sons This was quite a lot to take in and at first I was just going to just get on with my day but since some friends asked my opinion I decided to look into it a bit Firstly it should be understood that statistics can be easily twisted to argue any point so take everything including what I have said with a pinch of salt investigate things for yourself and make your own opinions Where I have used data it is from the  Office for National Statistics   by the UK government which has data about murder over the last   years I used data for the year        chosen by random however while researching I realised I could choose data from        which would support my arguments even better but decided against it as I don t want to cherry pick data like other groups do For instance  Femicide Census   report that    of women are killed by men are from a current or former partner as it fits their narrative at that moment Recently women are now claiming that they are killed mainly while walking down the street by random men So which is true Through the data it says that women killed by a current or former partner are around     That is quite a significant difference to a point where I can t even explain how they got that number Have you heard about Kieran Campbell He is a    year old boy and he went missing the same day as Sarah   rd March and thankfully was found  days later however in all that time I saw nothing from social media or the media except for this  News Story   which contains more information about Sarah s disappearance yet in no news story on Sarah have I seen information about Kieran Why the difference Looking more into the stats I found      men killed    women killed      of which for men killed    from someone they didn t know      of which for women killed    from someone they didn t know      So women saying they re killed by random men just for simply walking down the street is a lot less likely than they are implying it is far more likely they know the guy AND it is more likely men get killed for walking down the street by someone random   Looking at where people have been killed residential vs public places in percentage Male      Women           Therefore men are far more likely than women to be killed on the street      Women are much more likely to be killed in a home than in a public place  just walking down the street which is against their current narrative   A bit off the topic but for the suspects of these murders      Female suspects are more likely to NOT be convicted of murder    of women aren t convicted of murder whereas    of men aren t convicted      Of those convicted    of men get life imprisonment whereas only    of women get life imprisonment for their murder      So basically women are REALLY unlikely to be killed by a stranger on the street yet men are more likely and spoke about less Enough of statistics let s just use some good old logic   There has been a call for men to be given a curfew of  pm to  protect women      The thing is if you single out one group and give them a curfew that is quite horrific but you can say it about men A good tool I use is can you change gender for another identifier will it still be okay to say Think race LGBTQ etc      Think about the number of people men save men are the massive majority of jobs working for public protection think police fire army etc   The    experience some kind of sexual harassment         I m not going to invalidate someone s personal experience although many posts on social media claiming that men do not experience sexual harassment is invalidating our experiences   ironic right      I find that stat quite insane I can t tell if it s accurate or not but I do have important questions         What counts as sexual harassment I ve heard some people say  being stared at by a male counts More often than not the dude was probably just daydreaming on the bus         How did they get this data did they interview random women on the street      I think that men also get sexually assaulted quite a lot but don t realise it Think about a man flashing a woman that s sexual assault Now a woman flashing a man will he if interviewed say he was sexually assaulted Me personally I have been touched inappropriately by women on multiple occasions non consensually  grabbing my butt and rolling their hand up to my inner thigh and I also been cat called  which was odd but I never really thought I has been sexually assaulted until I considered it the other way round So I wonder what  of men have been sexually assaulted And if so I don t think we should be teaching boys to not sexually harass women we should be teaching our children to understand boundaries and respect everyone    Teach sons to respect women    So this is going to be quite controversial But boys raised by singles mothers tend to be more likely to grow up and commit crime including harassing women So surely women aren t even teaching their sons And moreover can be inferred that men ARE teaching their sons and women are not Now this is maybe a bit too much of a blanket statement I believe anyone raised in a single parent household can grow up and do amazing things and won t become criminals but I think it is something worse considering   Commonly we are told that men are normalising rape due to making rape jokes I thought about this I have not ever heard a rape joke about women and only ever heard about rape jokes about men dropping the soap in the prison shower So I decided to search  rape joke on YouTube and what I found was many many videos of women making some kind of speech saying rape jokes are bad a video of a man affected by prison rape jokes as he had experienced it a comedian making jokes about how saying jokes about rape are taboo and an American Dad clip which did contain a rape joke I decided to take this further and asked people to  tell me a rape joke  no one I have asked can think of one except for the prison shower one   so please tell me a rape joke because I don t know if it is a thing So all in all what s going on right now on social media is perplexing But here s the great thing about social media you can turn it off For those who feel a

MensRights,1615657644, I appreciate any views on this but mostly I just want to open my mouth and complain about this situation and spread the word that this kind of misandry exists tl dr GF s friend is complaining about men all the time and tries to manipulate her into breaking up with me as she hates me too GF doesn t want to lose the others in the friend group but I don t like the idea of her hanging out with this toxic idiot My girlfriend has two social circles other one being her friends from uni One of her friends is really radical feminist a lesbian and someone who proudly tells people  she has no men in her life  other than her dad    Red flag   Well first I saw no problem in this everyone has the freedom to an opinion But now that I know the way she talks My GF and her friends have been meeting in our aparment for some time now and I have to listen to them At first I was happy cause I wanted to meet new people Lately I have been distancing myself from them for a reason This one girl complains about men  and straight people literally  all the fucking time  If they are watching TV  who there s so many men in this series   that male character is stupid  If they re talking about studies  this male professor is really racist and sexist and  If they re talking about politics or feminism  fuck all men   are you implying that men matter   ironic joke or is it    men are rapist pigs  I know she has asked the lecturer if she can change groups because she doesn t want to work with men ofc she worded it in a way that it s  men who are always harassing her She has also demanded that her essays must be double checked if the professor is a male Great  I have also heard her complaining about me she probably didn t realize I was home lol Apparently I m  mansplaining if I discuss things with them  even tho I mostly agree with them on many issues  I don t understand the world can t handle emotions  what     and I listen to  mens fantasy music full of rape and whores  she went thru my vinyl collection lol  Of course I have been furious at my GF for allowing her to talk like that in our home My GF told me she has also suggested breaking up with me  for no reason   and that my GF should take precautions because I might hurt her or rape her Nice Apparently this woman is a central person in this social circle and my GF is afraid to talk about this issue The others in this group are not as radical most of them being quite  normal people I would say My GF ofc wants to keep these friends as she doesn t want to study alone She also fears that she might become a target for bullying or something for example they already know shes not as left wing as they are and she gets some shit for this   My feelings   to put it shortly I don t want my partner to hang around toxic people who want to manipulate them and who apparently hate me for being a male We re afraid that if she doesn t want to be with them anymore they will accuse me of being a manipulator or something or accuse her of something else

MensRights,1615803516,Previously I posted   gt  It hurts i m just tired of it all I want to hug my mom     I was having an anxiety attack Thankfully talking to a friend actually helped     Why   I didn t know why but I was feeling very attacked by all these posts surrounding the tragic death of Sarah Evarard I sat in the shower for two hours and was recollecting my thoughts I decided to call a friend and while trying to talk I just burst out crying I realized that I felt like I was once again living in the moment I was  falsely accused  It felt like my victim hood was being stripped away because I was a man  I may have been oversensitive about it flame me or whatever  The only reason why after a whole year I could talk to women again is because another individual told me  not all woman are monsters and that was the self realization that my generalization of individuals to their group identity was dangerous    But this isn t about you   It really isn t I m glad that a lot of woman are sharing their experiences and shedding a new light on what they had to experience on a daily basis While I knew it was an issue I didn t think the scale of it would be this large So I do agree that women face the adversary of needing to be worried walking alone in the streets and it is a fair assumption for them to think the man behind her is a perpetrator  And yet I felt alienated unwanted and once again I found myself fearing women So I decided to look at it more constructively The conversation is about the struggle of being a woman needing to take more taxi rides than required   It is a real issue   But does generalizing men comparing us to ticks and even setting rules not set a negative tone towards men It feels more like  men are the issue than any solution really    I m no expert in stats  I don t care really While most post seem to always try to cater to stats towards making one community oppressed I am certain of one thing and that is my group identity does not define who tf I am    What s next   Next step for a solution to the issue is  What can we as every individual him her itself can do  rather than  What men should do because I really don t think that pushes the conversation forward  What do you guys think 
MensRights,1615803146,I understand this may not be directly linked to Mens Rights but I thought I d share it here in case anyone feels like using it So a lot of people know that radical femenists like to spread the lie that  Women earn    less than men for the same job  or some percentage of wage indifference However I thought of an argument which  should shut down a lot of liars Here s my example  Jim works in an office He earns some amount of money a year from his boss One day Jim decides that he wants to become transgender so he goes to the hospital and has the surgery Now Jim is sexually identified as a woman and goes by the name Lauren The next day Lauren goes back to  her job in the office  Now under the equal employment act Lauren s boss cannot change  her pay even if they have decided to change a part of their body  Lauren goes to her desk when the boss walks over   Sorry Lauren but you re a woman now That means I have to pay you    less of your wages I know you understand  Now here s the argument  Would that scenario ever happen in real life Lauren is a woman which means she  should be paid    less but that exchange between Lauren and  her boss would never happen because it s illogical So for that reason it proves that woman aren t paid less for the same job as that conversation would never take place

MensRights,1615769074, I just got censored for the first time I posted my men s rights view on a literal debate thread where we were supposed to debate I argued that the wage gap isn t bad and only exists because of personal choice the higher competitiveness of men and the distribution of intelligence  men are more likely to be really dumb or really smart while women are more average  However a couple days letter out of nowhere I was permanently banned I had a lengthy proper debate with others  no insults and even managed to change some views so I don t understand why I was banned My only guess was that maybe liberal woman decided to ban me for espousing that view and  offending her and didn t have the guts to debate me instead Or perhaps a male social justice warrior decided that they didn t want me on that subreddit because my views didn t align with theirs I asked multiple times why I was banned but it seems that the moderators have completely ghosted me and aren t responding 
MensRights,1615761176,Not sure if this has been seen outside of the UK but the news recently has been of  a man who killed a woman    Lots of vigils were held over the weekend  some being broken up by police   as we are currently in a national lockdown and large groups of people cannot gather This has been hailed as  police not protecting women and there is a lot of talk about there being too many women being killed by men and  women matter less than cars   and no one is talking about men I did a little research on the  Office for National Statistics   website and saw a very different picture  The increase in homicide between the year ending March     and year ending March     reflected a    rise in the number of male victims which increased from    in the year ending March     to    in the year ending March      Over the same period the number of female victims increased from    to        increase   A little more reading supports the idea that more men than women are victims of homicide in the UK  In the latest year there has been a    increase in the number of male victims     to      Conversely the number of female victims fell by     from    to      the first decrease since year ending March      Why is it that only women are being talked about It wouldn t make sense if the ratio of male and female victims was    to only talk about women but it s not it s worse for men

MensRights,1615751491,A manchild is essentially a man with means  or who has the potential to earn a decent living who focuses on himself instead of on women and starting a family  Such a man is seen as selfish and immature  And this is because the default expectation is that he should settle down get married and have children  His money isn t seen as belonging to him and his happiness isn t taken as a priority  People instead think about all the women out there who could take his money and spend it on themselves and their happiness But can t because he s too busy spending it on things he wants to do According to at least one article about this some of the signs of a manchild include   Talk of children or commitment brings panic to his eyes    He avoids serious conversation meaning he changes the topic when you try to convince him to marry you or have kids with him   His interests and friendships carry a middle school vibe  In other words he likes to have fun instead of getting serious about that marriage and children thing everyone wants him to do The default gynocentric view is that this is harmful to women  That these men who are living their lives for themselves and not for women and children are doing something wrong  And the articles you see about this definitely take that approach  The message is that a proper mature man does everything he can for women  Including handing over his money so she can live in a big house possibly have kids with him and then not have to work a job anymore Society condemns and criticizes men who don t do this which I don t think is fair  If women are strong and independent then we shouldn t be shaming men into being providers and  good husbands for them  Let him have his hobbies and spend his money how he deems appropriate  His time money and energy do not belong to women  And if you want to talk about being selfish that expectation itself is what s selfish

MensRights,1615747812,Trying to not be long winded here but this is bugging me to no end    One regular argument we hear from feminists and women s rights activists is how women must fear being raped by a random man on the street  Our typical reply is along the lines of men are  times more likely to be violently assaulted including murder more so by a stranger  Which is imperially true So this extremely sad and unfortunate murder of Sarah Everard is showing the true colors of feminism what happened to her IS A MALE ISSUE  She was murdered not raped or kidnapped she was murdered the very thing we as men show is a real problem for us at triple the rate of women  So a male victim dominated crime happens to a women and it s all about women  The issue murder has been hijacked and turned political This is something we can not let happen or allow the opposite to happen either when something exceptional happens to us  We must speak up and point out this victim championing  The media is not helping of course and we can t really contact them so it s important we point out what happened to Sarah is the very thing we men are expressing we have to worry about being murdered at triple the rate   The women s right movement is taking something that is a primary male issue to the degree of triple the rate and taking a single instance and claiming the entire problem is not only theirs but using it to place blame  This is not productive for them or us it helps no one because it s changing the narrative of who the victims  usually are which takes focus off a problem and shifts it to a smaller one Please speak up  Please make note this is the exact issue we are bringing up when women bring up walking down the street in fear of rape men have to worry about exactly what happened to Sarah and it falls on deaf ears regularly  Use this as an example of something that happens to men more than women women are not excluded from it Sarah Everard is your example and express how there are issues that happen to women more than men but do still happen to men We need to take the high road here and use Sarah Everard s untimely death as something for progress positivity and unity instead of adding fuel to the hate and blame fire with silly arguments and being defensive  Let s be positive and use this as a mutual point to talk not a contentios point to argue

MensRights,1615865126,A lot has been said and written about the Sarah Everard case except about one aspect of it the broadcast and social media reactions to it which barely got any coverage That s regrettable because I strongly feel that in the longer term exactly the media aspect will be the case s true legacy What I see currently is a mass hysteria triggered by the broadcast and social media s treatment of the case What I see is the unrestrained and uninhibited exploitation of an in and by itself anomalous case no matter how tragic When such a case is weaponized for political purposes especially when the purpose is to extract changes in legislation and public policy the result can lead or at least contribute to an unmitigated disaster It would be better if cooler heads prevailed than to risk such a disaster The Sarah Everard case is completely atypical Kidnapping a woman from a street is extremely rare both in the UK and elsewhere Crime statistics are dropping for decades and at least in the US are at a record low Men are the main targets of violent crime       of violent attacks are against men  US data  Moreover the overwhelming majority of victims of homicides by a stranger are men while women are killed more often by people they know So women are much much safer walking down a street than men But these facts never bother extremists and the propagandists serving them What they want is the weaponization of a single atypical case and anecdotes are used the same way This how propaganda is made The propagandists  in this case feminists and women who approve of them pick atypical cases or anecdotes and hype them up by the media that regrettably they control Then they use them as bludgeons to extort female friendly and anti male legislation and policies When there is no atypical single case or anecdote they just make one up Like in      when they published an entirely manufactured  study claiming that  schools shortchange girls  when it wasn t true then as it is not true now The  study got hyped up in headlines in the MSM which never performed any reality check about it The hype resulted in a faux moral panic about  shortchanged girls This panic led to legislation in      the Gender Equity Education Act  GEEA that is still not repealed even though it is clearly proven to be based on a falsehood The genesis of this piece of legislation perfectly illustrates the process from anecdote atypical case to hype to faux moral panic to ill conceived legislation that goes counter to all available facts and data and even counter to reason The success of such a tactic convinces the propagandists of the tactic s effectiveness Rightly so because despite its immorality it produces the intended results regardless how sinister those results may be From this point on the propagandists don t want to waste a single suitable  crisis  without turning it into an opportunity for hatred and extortion If there isn t a  crisis  they fabricate one What I sense as danger in this case is that the seductive power of a perfect  opportunity to enact policy changes or legislation might prevail again leading to even more baseless hatred against men even more misandry than what we already face with the appropriate policy consequences Think of the ill fated comment of a British MP about imposing a  p m curfew on men and the wide acceptance it immediately received Not universal acceptance but a wide one Many pieces circulated pondering the practical use and justification of such a curfew until even broader disapproval forced the MP to retroactively proclaim it a joke  in typical retroactive feminist fashion  It is just not very believable that a British MP would be joking in the middle of a national uproar about a murder It stands to reason that she was serious about it and meant every word Then think of the consequences if it had been taken seriously and implemented That s what  ill conceived means and the unethical use of propaganda is the fastest way to ill conceived policies Let s not fall for it this time

MensRights,1615836397,So hey  I have been on social media and hearing a lot of posts about woman being discriminated  which is disgusting and should never happen  I assume this is because if the Sarah Everand murder  again hope the perpetrator rots in jail  However the backlash against men in general is extremely worrying     So let me get something straight     I FULLY SUPPORT the movement tk encourage safety for women and making the streets safer However I have been recently seeing posts that have said  k llallmen and people suggesting that men should have a curfew  And some posts I have seen on insta  by  feepaints the one with nearly    k likes have truly got we worried Whilst posts makes some excellent points I feel as if it has some serious flaw overlooked points The final line on this post was  Not all men but probably You Excuse me what So a small percentage of men  who should be ashamed who do this suddenly represents the entire male gender If anything it wants to make me cry thinking that now I am  to the people who commit such atrocities How can people be so insensitive to the fact that males have emotions to say something so demonising To demonstrate its stupidity some of their statements sound I d like to show you what happens when we substitute a race  religion into that same statement   not all men but enough to be scared of all men    Not all  insert race people  insert crime  but enough to be scared of all  insert race people  Imagine if someone on social media posted that That would basically be a speedrun of getting cancelled lmao And before I round off I d like to lead you to the insta post from earlier   feepaints  It quotes  men who are really scared of being falsely accused are apparently part of the problem Now this is BS Now it s only a small amount of women who falsely accuse But according to their ideology it doesn t matter if its a small  of women who do I should be scared of all of them  Sounds dumb right Cos it is Finally I would like to say I love the idea of equality but does preventing discrimination against one group  require  the need to discrimate against an other No This is one way to take an organisation cause which I fully support with all my heart and then absolutely discredit everything they said and make them seem downright stupid  Rant over Love to see your opinions everyone Unlike some of the other people who discriminate against men  again I have seen good posts who don t do this I won t count out any opinions

MensRights,1615828128,Alimony in principle is gender neutral  The way it is actually applied is could be wrong But in principle seems correct If there are  people who had children together Partner  cuts down on his career to support partner the kids Now partner  has a life long obligation to support partner  financially It is because if partner  did not compromise on his career for them both he could have been much better financially  I am using he as a universal pronoun here could be a she And partner   indirectly through childcare contributed financially and is entitled to a share in their combined income If one employs a baby sitter or cook one has to pay them Partner  took up that role for free Even after a divorce even if partner  is self sufficient his career has still been set back by several years due to compromises involved in childcare So a lifelong alimony seems just There is a famous married couple husband and wife The wife is an international sportswoman and the husband took care of children and household so she could proceed in her career In case she divorces him he deserves a share in her money by right This topic was discussed before but most people here felt alimony shouldn t be a lifelong deal But if partner  could have been a ceo but is instead in a significantly lesser position thanks to career compromises isn t compensation warranted in the event of divorce 
MensRights,1615827294,The first incident that made me question my own feminist label was this incident in India A female actress and celebrity named kangana ranaut in India claimed that Hrithik Roshan a famous and beloved celebrity and  a married man courted her but made sure she was not given a role in his movie after their break up Hrithik filed a defamation case against her but media took kangana s side Even after facts revealed themselves kangana was respectfully invited everywhere to shit on hrithik The facts of this case are bizarre because kangana literally made up a relationship Here is what investigation revealed      kangana did not submit ANY proof and refused to submit even her own laptop and phone to the police She had no practical proof for a  year affair  or      Hritik submitted his phones and laptops and police traced their activity Hritik contacted kangana  times in the entire duration of the alleged affair Police actually declared that they are convinced hritik is innocent   Kangana only wrote mails to an a c that was traced to usa was probably a catfisher using hritik s name Or else ya hritik was at  places at the same time   hritik s passport had no stamps of foreign travel to paris   where allegedly he proposed to kangana   Mails where kangana obsessively stalked hritik even admitting he never talks to her were sent from kangana s mail id to hritik s  kangana said hritik hacked her a c and sent those mails to himself       Kangana s team tried photoshopping images from a party to prove an affair Hrithik s ex wife  wife at the time of the alleged affair came out in Hrithik s support and revealed original photos in which bollywood celebrities were all partying and she was present along with hrithik in that party If kangana were male media would have CHEWED her but is hypocritically silent ONLY because she is a woman Also when her ex adhyayan suman came forward bravely to reveal that kangana was abusive people made fun of him something that would never happen to women  This is to not say that women in India donot get abused But there are  sides to every coin A similar case happened in south korea kim hyung joon His ex falsely accused him of abuse and dragged him down In these cases people say there is no smoke without fire A man who makes good money is a pervert 
MensRights,1615826624,I have a feeling the answer would be HELL NO  because there are no issues whatsoever in social justice where women are blamed for anything unless it harms other women in which case it s called  internal misogyny  The issue would probably be  nonexistent altogether if there were no male abusers  But I also have a feeling that men are being harmed a lot worse mentally and physically than most people know We are still at the point where most people believe that men cannot even be victims of violence in M F relationships let alone need help  Feminists have been denying women s role in domestic abuse even though several studies have come out shedding a light on it You still see feminists trying to discredit these studies which leads me to believe that they weren t done by feminists why would they  For most of them the whole thing is a foregone conclusion and any evidence to the contrary might discredit their religious beliefs upon which so much depends See the Duluth model for example Men are pretty much on their own to deal with this

MensRights,1615930972, Part I Anthropological Analysis    Women are not sexually attracted to men   They are disgusted by the male form disgusted by our veiny musculature and disgusted by our body hair A man can never be attractive like a woman can As you can imagine this makes life unfairly difficult for men and unjustly easy for women    If you are a woman you will simply never understand what it s like to be a man   What it s like to walk down the street in public You will never understand how we are treated by society Truly you would not last a week as a male in       Good hard working well deserving men are rejected and left to rot in loneliness for no other reason than simply because they were born male For as far back as humanity goes good decent men have been tortured in this way You have twice as many female ancestors as you do male ancestors That s right   women are twice as successful as producing offspring than men   You might be thinking  what that can t be right   Just take for example this say there are two men and two women Each women has kids with one of the men We can see in this example     of the women pass on their genes but only    of the men do  Being born a man is like being born an anal beetle Females are living life on easy mode they will never have to struggle and they will never have to fight Females live a life of blissful ignorance love and acceptance   Even the most unintelligent uninteresting unsuccessful unlucky physically disabled female lives with a level of privilege far beyond    of men     Part II Sexual Anarcho Capitalism  Of course there are the  Chads  the upper echelon of men that are hoarding all the sex leaving almost nothing for the rest of us Gee sound familiar It s almost as if free markets lead to wealth inequality and   a free anarchistic overly sexual dating marketplace leads to SEXUAL INEQUALITY   Like how bootlicking capitalists will convince themselves that every poor person in America  just isn t working hard enough  so too will blue pulled normies convince themselves that incels just need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps The world is completely fair bro if you can t find a date the only reason is because you need to take a shower and hold frame Why do people think this It s because if you admit that the system is unfair you must thereby admit that your success in the system is unjustified Once you admit that the economic system is not a meritocracy it is no longer possible to say  I earned it fair and square    And by acknowledging that the dating marketplace is unjust you relinquish some of your sexual power   Sure you ve fucked plenty of girls But you didn t earn it You just got lucky Your sexual conquests in life are not based on your own merit but factors that were completely outside of your control   Think about that before you go online and give  advice to struggling men   Remember that you have no fucking idea what you re talking about when it comes to attracting women  I m trying to open your eyes You are deluded You are wrong Please have the strength to just admit you are wrong It s better to look like a fool once and admit you re wrong than to stay wrong and look like a fool for the rest of your life Men are not the problem You are not the problem kings It s everybody else that is the problem Just because someone is poor this does not mean they are lacking in some moral capacity Just because someone is sex poor does not mean that they are of lesser moral value   Part III Collective Responsibility vs Individual Responsibility Also I m not absolving myself of personal responsibility Nice try though Just because you admit that racism exists doesn t mean you re going to give up on life until the whole world is no longer racist I m just saying that your life can be shit and it s not even your fault   You wouldn t tell someone living in North Korea  Hey man quit complaining about the system you live in and only focus on yourself Have you tried going to the gym     I know as a redditor this may seem SHOCKING to you but we can work on self improvement AND point out problems in society all at the same time I know crazy right Isn t that just the most insane thing you ve ever heard   Part IV TL DR TL DR Ideas from the sexual liberation movement have been taken to such an extreme that we are now living in a hyper sexualized coomer wasteland For women this has led them to having infinite access to sex and very little access to committed relationships A incredibly small minority of men have access to more sex than any human needs in      lifetimes while the vast majority of men are sex poor and sex starved The data reflects this  There is only one whole in my argument I m an incel so therefore everything I say is automatically wrong

MensRights,1615906145,Yet my school who has a UN sort of group  can t really explain it too well is talking about violence in the home and is painting it as a women s issue I m sure these numbers don t surprise any of you but everyone I know has told me women are victims of violence more often than men     
MensRights,1615906016,Hello r mensrights Tl dr falsely accused almost lost everything if you are curious read the whole thing and if you re really curious read my post history A tl dr cannot express this adequately  I ve been a longtime lurker and occasional poster here I am a guy in his    s who was falsely accused of domestic violence and I have been active on r supportfortheaccused since just after my case started but I wanted to share here to bring visibility to this issue In May of      an ex girlfriend that I refused to date again decided that I said something just a little too mean to her and decided to go nuclear I had been dating another girl for a couple months after our relationship ended about five months before My ex was in a rough place She was  probably still is a dancer who had no real family to speak of and just could not find her way Despite the crappy end to our short relationship I still wanted to be in her life if only to show her that there were other ways to live and she didn t have to do what she was doing to survive In April of     I had decided that enough was enough A mutual friend of ours killed himself because of her treatment of him and she had done what she did to me to the guy after me Her kicking and screaming finally didn t work and I let go She did not take our friends suicide well and she started spiraling She regularly tried to contact me and I ignored her The day before this happened she showed up at my door and I saw the state she was in and felt horrible for her She had some old bruises on her neck from according to her a guy she met at a BDSM club while she was out of state They were yellow and fading so it had been some time I knew she tended to be into that sort of thing and it is the   reason in a long list of why we broke up She asked if we could go talk and I said yes like a moron We went out for drinks that night along with the girl I was dating at the time My girlfriend had to work the next day and left about halfway through the night I ubered with my ex back to her place and was worried about her suicidal ideation and wasn t in a place to drive myself considering my car was still at home and the drinking so I stayed on the couch The next morning after I had made breakfast and was getting ready to leave she started talking about rekindling our relationship which I refused I told her I couldn t carry her deteriorating mental health anymore and that this would be the last time She seemed to have taken this unusually well and proceeded to hop on a video chat with that guy she met at this club and started telling him all the same things she would tell me All the gushy nonsense When she got off with him I explained that this was why I could never be with her She had screwed me over and done this when I was with her then she did it with the guy right after me and she had done it so badly to our friend that he killed himself It was like a bomb went off She jumped on top of me and started wailing on my face and torso and screaming incoherently I didn t want to hurt her so I just tried to block her arms and calm her down I ended up with two black eyes lacerations all over my face bruises on the left zygomatic bone and a fractured floating rib I pushed her off of me and she ran and locked herself in a bathroom Some time goes by and the police show up and violently take me into custody She proceeds to tel every officer wildly different stories and had had her guy in another state call for her who s story was also wildly different from hers He had never met me and identified me as the wrong race and in the wrong clothes as noted in the police reports Every report is different actually and not on little details They re wildly different The neighbors only heard the screams from when she was beating me and none of the supposed cries for help as I  strangled her one handed I won t go into the ins and outs of everything since my post history is a pretty good play by play as this stuff was happening The biggest kicker is that she continued to text me during the time I wasn t talking to her and one of these texts is a selfie from the BDSM club out of state where the bruises I mentioned earlier are clearly visible and it is from a good while beforehand  I think I m set I show the arresting officers and     they don t care I am charged with a felony and class I misdemeanor I spend  days in jail and denied PR bond My family posts bail and I come out to my EMS licensure being  suspended while an investigation is underway  facing expulsion from my college seeing the applications I had put out for medical school since I was a junior being  no longer under consideration given the circumstances  She had called everyone important in my life My mentors my friends my family my college everyone to tell them  what I did  I faced losing everything I fought for    months I fought the allegations in court but I fought myself most of all I wanted to die every day and a few times I tried I told the world what was going on anyone who would listen as I fell apart inside I had my family and friends behind me as well as the girl I was with  she is now my fianc lol and they pinched every penny to pay the cost of defense something I am blessed for Then I noticed that nobody believed me guilty I showed the reports anyone who would listen like a freak  The courts though they didn t care The prosecutor on my case reviewed the data dump of my phone  all her messages her threats of false accusation to me and others her harassment after the fact apologizing for everything etc and the photographic evidence I put forward and added an additional felony I was facing FIFTEEN YEARS in prison My ex harassing me every day didn t matter my evidence didn t matter her blatantly inconsistent statements throughout didn t matter I was at a loss  One month before resolution my family retained a new attorney who had been a DV prosecutor for the most liberal county in Colorado for more than half of her career In this time the original prosecutor on my case was fired for undisclosed reasons Still they would not dismiss it I was offered a deferred deal of  months of probation and   hours of community service and I could plea Alford  maintain innocence and accept the sentence  The case would be dismissed at the end and the record sealed  for all time   My family and my now fianc wanted me to keep going but it was destroying me and destroying them Not only had I lost almost everything they had too We sold everything and my grandfather no longer has a retirement I could not live with what I had done to them anymore and my attorney said that trial was risky because even if they just convicted me of low class misdemeanor harassment my future would be destroyed anyway I took the  deal  The statute for harassment in Colorado criminalizes everything and if you don t believe me look it up  The case is set to be dismissed and sealed in mid July but healthcare licensing departments are exempt from the sealing order  the list of exempt entities is longer than you would think and I cannot find out if they will approve me for licensure unless I go through all the schooling and try Myself my fianc  my parents and my grandfather packed up and left Colorado We are the first to do so in over a hundred years The individuals involved in probation and the treatment they make you do believe I am innocent They have been kinder than I expected and have done everything they can to help but their hands are tied in most ways My ex continues to harass me monthly and has admitted through traceable electronic means that she lied about it all I have posted an example here so you can see  it s in my post history as well  I get death threats from her criminal friends weekly The state of Colorado does not care They will not file charges nor will they vacate them I can attempt to file civilly to the tune of      k that I nor anyone in my family has anymore It has cost nearly        not including the costs post plea We are financially destitute at this point and I have to live with destroying my family s lives This is the face of false accusations Lives are destroyed every day Not just the men whom are accused but any who stand with them I barely made it out alive and tens of thousands of others at a minimum live like this This must end We cannot as a society abide this anymore I lived through regular sexual assault as a child at the hands of a woman I was beaten daily the first ten years of my life by the same woman She faced no repercussions I was beaten again by a woman and faced the extinction of everything I had sought to achieve and she faced no repercussions despite admitting she lied and everything else I have said I can tell you having lived through all that that there is no more horrible thing to live through than a false accusation I would live through my childhood a hundred times before going through this once I am still broken and slowly picking up the pieces of my shattered life and I still do not know if it will ever be the same again I know that MRA s stand with men like me I know that we can do this I am begging you and the world do not leave the falsely accused behind There are too many of us who s voices are silenced forever That is why I keep going  PS I am willing to back up everything I have said here I ve got a nice fat dump of thousands of texts photos witnesses all the case files everything I am not full of shit
MensRights,1615905517,I read feminist post and it makes me wanna blow my brains out Like the fact that they are so uneducated is just amazing It s funny when you pin them in an argument and they won t have anything to say Another great thing is that they work  together but once one of them does something wrong they act like none of them even know each other I wonder what they will do when so many false rape accusations come out that people will start not believing anyone so when a real rape victim comes out no one is going to believe her They are fighting for nothing and they are never to accomplish anything nuff said

MensRights,1616960162,This statement will almost undoubtably cause shrieking from feminists but the fact is there is some truth to it I am not a rape apologist by any means but there are plenty of women with domination and rape fantasies who say no to sex but later express disappointment when their partner actually stops This like likely where the stereotype  women dont know what they want comes from Ppl need to understand that this toxic feminine behaviour must be eliminated if we want to make consent more intuitive and less of a gray area in many cases for many men who are confused by women s mixed signals 
MensRights,1616949359,How is it okay for females to ask their partners to be okay with what they are wearing What part of wearing tight short cloth is okay I don t get this How do they even have the fuckin audacity to ask men to accept this shit knowing they will get checked out 
MensRights,1616943613,Humans need sleep In any relationship you as a man have the right to sleep But American culture has an implicit subtext that interrupts that rule As American men we are expected to forego sleep in order to meet the emotional conversational and sexual needs of our female partners  Last night I was falling asleep after a long day of work Instead of letting me sleep my girlfriend got dressed in lingerie and made me have sex with her She does this often ignoring my need for sleep Sometimes I am so dog tired from my work at the Mill I can barely stand Yet she wont let me sleep unless I fulfill her extensive needs Sometimes she will bring home female friends from work and I have to fulfill their sexual needs too Or they distract me from sleep by cooking me sumptuous meals This is just so ridiculous I have a constitutional right to sleep 
MensRights,1616934321,We talked about sexism and police and then my sister brought up that gay men can t go to the military and I just said that the military is super sexist in general because we have mandatory military service for men but women are allowed to go if they want and lesbians are also allowed in the military     My sister started screaming that that has nothing to do with sexism and she wouldn t explain that to me because I was such a big idiot for believing that    Anyone has even any idea what she could have meant 
MensRights,1616934128,I got banned form several forums and meetings because I actually took the definition of feminism serious and talked about equality but actually they only allow woman s issues So the logic next step would be to create a group where you can talk about mens issues with equality but somehow everyone hates that Lefty YouTubers always say that it is just a few isolated incidents where feminists have a issue with men but that     of MRA are missoginistic incels
MensRights,1616925779,I have more reasons to hate feminism then most as I got a serious criminal record for a domestic violence crime I didn t commit which fucked me up in many ways and has kind of ruined my life It has been about  years since then and I have no motivation to hate on feminism at all I expect a Maoist revolution is the only way true gender equality would be reached but I know most people here wouldn t want that as most people here live in the imperialist first world and benefit from the current system of extracting surplus labour value from exploiting workers in the third world So why not just move on and live your life with the hand you have been dealt I know that s all I can do There is no way we can change the current gender system the ruling class supports it As I write this I realize I am still quite depressed and maybe would support MRA if it worked but I think men s rights is a dead end if feminism is being used by the ruling class 
MensRights,1616923378,I ve been a part of this subreddit for many months I ve also seen A LOT of videos on YouTube about MRA and even feminism There are misconceptions from both sides about third world countries A lot of people from first world countries say that they don t need feminism but third world countries do But based on my experience and what feminism spreads it turns out women of my country don t want feminism too The recent events on Women s Day confirm it  I ve made a post about it too    The summary of this post is that they don t research the culture of a certain country they just want to promote their agenda no matter where in the world they are  I am speaking on behalf of my country Yes I am aware that some people  or women of other third world countries may not have as many rights as my country but I can t speak on behalf of them I can only tell you about my country Just in case you re wondering I m from Pakistan

MensRights,1616910711,I am a single Dad I have one son who s   with my ex wife and a daughter in my current   nd marriage Tonight my son had a major emotional meltdown and lashed out at me After hours of breaking down his wall we finally got to the core of his upset which is that he s afraid to trust me because since I divorced his mom  after she cheated on me but be doesn t know that because he was less than a year old she has had a revolving door of relationships and every time he gets close to the new guy she breaks it off So he s angry at his mom because of her serial monogamy and he takes it out on me because of reasons I m still trying to wrap my head around He says he isn t angry at me for leaving and is very clear he s mad at her I can understand it because she has literally been in    relationships in the last   years and every time ends up kicking the guys to the curb I know this isn t really a men s rights issue but truly I don t have a strong community of buddies I can talk to And I literally have no other Dad friends So I m hoping the mods will forgive me because I could use some support from men But if this post needs or refered somewhere else I ll understand Thanks in advance

MensRights,1616886343,This is a rant If not allowed delete I ve been watching Sammy  The Bull Gravano on YouTube recently For those unfamiliar he s a former underboss of the Gambino crime family turned government informant He s pretty famous because he did a lot of John Gotti s dirty work Anyway I m watching this guy who is basically a total bastard but an amazing story teller saying things like  That s just Cosa Nostra  and  We were a secret society  I m listening to this guy talk about this evil fraternity of killers and I m wondering why this is so interesting to me All of a sudden I randomly understood it It s not about the danger or the crime It s the fact that men s organizations don t exist anymore I totally understand this sounds like a major stretch and there is a lot more involved notoriety Hollywood etc But I honestly think that the public fascination with the Mafia has something to do with the lost privacy of men s only organizations Why did the Elks Club need to admit women What do women add to the organization Why can t men have their own space A hundred years ago it was normal for every man to have a career a family and a brotherhood Now anyone who talks about men s only organizations are treated like bigots The only ones who can talk about it are former mafiosos who got out of prison and nobody can shame them any further Back then a brotherhood was an important part of a man s social life The old divorced mafiosos with criminal immunity are the only ones left who don t care what society thinks about them and can talk about it I just think there should be clubs for men where women aren t allowed Just a place to see friends and establish traditions do good work for the public and throw some parties If that makes me sound like a bigot then fine 
MensRights,1616882436,So i started editing wikipedia about a month ago havent done too much If ur not familiar with why we hate wikipedia its bc its articles reek of feminists nonsense like the Sexism article or the Mary Koss article What I ve noticed is the prob tho is not just the biased liberal admins but the fact that wikipedia loves academic sources and since academia is predominantly feminists wikipedia is too So not too sure how to proceed i doubt wikipedia is as important as social media platforms since the avg person doesnt have the patience  wikipedia but i m still trying to make edits here and there I figure the best way is to make small changes over time that r less noticeable that they will allow kinda like slowly boiling the frog alive

MensRights,1616876902,Paternity leave is beneficial for men Many women get paid maternity leave after having children but many fathers are left out Paternity leave allows men to also spend time with children and this is beneficial for young boys because boys with a strong father figure are happier and more successful that boys without one  It also allows a break for men It is also good for women because women can focus more on their careers when they choose to go back to work helping increase women s wages It is a win win for everyone

MensRights,1616000495,  I guess this is why people here hate me since I ve been calling myself a feminist but I have no idea how else to label myself What s the term that shouldbe used Gender Equalist Idk  I am part of our gender equality association at work because I ve been a slightly active advocate for some years  now Ideally the core of what I believe to be feminism is both genders being afforded the same rights Like if a man accuses a woman of rape and vice versa they should be tried and protected under the same circumstances If a woman and a man file for custody of their child ability and not how the  more nurturing gender should be favored I know this is BS because my father is not a good caregiver but I know a lot of peolple whose fathers seem to be better at parenting than the moms  Or something as simple not so simple as the idea that a man should be allowed to express themselves freely without fear of others telling them it makes them less of a man   So my question WHAT DO YOUR FEMINISTS BELIEVE TO BE FEMINISM AND ARE THERE ANY BOOKS OR MATERIALS YOU VE ENCOUNTERED THAT POINT TO THIS FRANKLY ATROCIOUS and ARCHAIC FEMALE SUPREMACIST POV

MensRights,1615953548,I wasn t saying that it boils down to that because that s the way it should be I was saying that generally most people aren t consistent   at all over  whether they should be touched in the workplace by others  People will generally pick and choose to where if they perceive the person doing the touching as attractive they don t have problems with it but if they find the person to be unattractive   well you have this very post as an example This happens to both women and men so I d pin this as just a human thing Again this isn t everyone but it is a very real phenomenon This is behavior I remember seeing since elementary school even If you ask me personally I don t think that these kinds of things should happen in a workplace and that people can and should take that stuff outside These are just my beliefs however and I m not going to impose rules on anybody not that I have the authority to anyways  Asking first is the most sensible thing although you d also be surprised as to how many people would be put off and made uncomfortable by that when asked as well especially if it s from a person they don t deem attractive It s a complicated issue no doubt  
MensRights,1615953504,There is no such thing as rape culture and rape allegations do NOT get ignored  You are repeating feminist propaganda 
MensRights,1615953433,Yeah  women are also excluded for getting certain crimes  such as rape Furthermore  alot of women who ve killed their children and even babies have gotten of  Skylar Richardson and Jodi So you are right  I also believe female crimes tend to be overlooked by the police 
MensRights,1615953342,Ok no I agree that that s fucked up but that isn t  the female nature you sound like an incel
MensRights,1615953304,Oh I thought you were serious  sorry  It s just everyone thinks all advocacies of progressivism is somehow the ideals of Marx and don t get me wrong you can critique Marxist ideals however atleast be right Like Marx was an egalitarian  he was not a feminist and furthermore would probably support the same advocacies as us  Anti Draft and so on

MensRights,1615951694,I didn t ask why women avoid men Why are you answering questions I ve not asked  And how answering your questions you posed at the very beginning of your post you ll have to rephrase that so it makes sense  So you want all of us men to do what exactly What exactly would that entail Please explain the process of doing this I m not a policeman I ve never made an arrest In what ways should I hold all these men accountable what do you want me to do with them Is that even possible  How about you answer these questions as well I d love to know your take on that
MensRights,1615951629,No it doesn t boil down to that at all Nobody should be allowed to touch another person at work women touchers included If a woman wants to touch him she should ask for his permission or ask him if he wants to go on a date with her If he says no then that s it One touch and he is filing the complaint with HR Dammit 
MensRights,1615951422,No I am  not suggesting they avoid men I am telling you  why they avoid men and how answering your questions you posed at the very beginning of your post You combat the idea  by holding men accountable for their actions  You asked I answered 
MensRights,1615951418,All this  Also Extend genital integrity protections to men Extend all ACA entitlements that you reasonably can  I m not asking for a pap smear in the name of equality which are only provided to women to men Make the Selective Service mandate gender neutral or abolish it Replace  assault laws   which use the gender of the victim to determine the severity of the crime Conduct an official audit into the gender sentencing gap  I m not sure how to proceed from there but we at least need the data to know where the problem lies Eliminate alimony and instead employ social safety nets if a someone needs financial support post divorce Reform child support and require that a certain percentage of each check be put towards the child 
MensRights,1615951337,You are gross He has every right to decide who can touch him and who cannot You even implying that this shouldn t be the case shows how gross you are Just because she dates a particular woman if she dates anybody which is BTW nobody else s business does not mean that all other women are free to touch him in any way they want You know otherwise he would be  gross  according to you I have never heard anything more gross than this idea You are very very gross Just that you know

MensRights,1615950818, gt just have a little fun with it and flirt back a little The worst thing he could do Just encourage them more are you nuts They will take it as a  yes and think he is interested in women who could be his mother That would normalize female sexual aggression toward young men even more and make it socially acceptable and once something becomes socially acceptable legislation won t be far behind to actually legalize and reward it Absolutely not he should instantly go to HR with his lawyer writing to HR to make them cease and desist or else lawsuit will follow Every man who is harassed this way should do likewise Also bring publicity to the cases That s how feminists started  metoo even though there is more female aggression towards men then vice versa OP absolutely don t do what this poster suggested

MensRights,1615950496,So a woman you dated can go to court and lie about you because shes angry say you stalked her say you re dangerous and a threat and since     of restraining orders are passed regardless of their merit and women know this  you lose your god given right to protect you and your family Bear in mind the accused never harmed threatened or assaulted anyone I know this because it happened to me a woman I broke up with and hadn t spoken to in  years I messaged her after I broke up with my current gf and because she was still mad about old drama decided to punish me with a false restraining order It s called restraining order abuse This bill does nothing but disarm people I ve never committed a crime in my entire life never even had a speeding ticket I ve never raised my voice to a woman I ve never stalked or hit a woman The aforementioned woman was however abusive to me physically and verbally as have several woman I ve dated been It was obviously a mistake messaging her but I didnt deserve what happened to me This does nothing but give women even more privilege and power in the family court system but this time their abuses aren t limited to actual family I spent       and endured psychological abuse trying to stop my abuser only to unjustly lose but it wasnt so bad because I still had my gun rights Now you want to take away my ability to defend myself and my children What if someone breaks into our house while we are home Guns should only be taken away from people who are actually aggresively violent who have caused physical harm and not in self defense I know I m not the only one There are millions of silent men like me Restraining orders dont work the best thing for a woman to do to defend herself is to become proficient with a firearm and carry daily A piece of paper will not protect you from an abuser who likely has nothing to lose anyway and you should take responsibility for your own protection not put it into the hands of strangers Did you know it s common for the woman s defense attorney to press for a domestic violence protection order at the beginning of a divorce in order to stack the bargaining chips in their favor Who could possibly imagine a woman abusing restraining orders to get even no that would never happen 
MensRights,1615950473,You re ignoring my counter points and restating your original post Let me re state my points in bigger font so you won t miss it this time    gt Mothers are LEGALLY OBLIGATED to take of their kids it s not  unpaid labour it s parental OBLIGATION repeat this with me    gt Rent is NOT FREE you re  obligated to be helpful around the house It s not YOUR house so you pay rent indirectly One of those ways is cleaning it and cooking food   gt Husband s MONEY goes to the Wife he doesn t keep it all for himself   So that s already something that the wife is claiming that s not hers So let s recap the Woman lives RENT FREE and uses Hubby s Credit Card and it s the Husband that owes her money   Uhhh what   gt Ask most mothers who live in cities in India  BOO HOO Mrs Upper Caste Indian Feminust has it so Hard Meanwhile poor Indian women walk bare foot to collect firewood amp water EVERYDAY You don t represent the    of rural Indians you represent the concerns of urban upper class Indians  Most rural indians don t even divorce they stay married and if anyone deserves alimony it s the village women not the upper class rich Feminist  gt the emotional needs of kids will become neglected What rubbish Boys need Father Figures otherwise boys will end up as Overly Feminised Simps  You can t reduce the father s role to an inhuman ATM in the family he s a human and he doesn t need to waste all his energy on an anti family Career Both parents can do jobs that give lots of free time to spend at home thus the chores are EQUALLY split and the boy gets to spend time with his primary male role model In case you miss my point AGAIN who owns the house is not a trivial detail Rent is NOT FREE if you re gonna treat family like it s a  business partnership then I m going to account for the   UNPAID RENT   Since no rent is paid i m going to deduct it via Housework Therefore Alimony is COMPLETELY unwarranted 
MensRights,1615950382,The problem is that the unattractive women just don t give up and leave him alone They know they can get away with it Pure sexual harassment They are so disgusting 
MensRights,1615950208,Yeah man does it harassment Woman does it privilege  Are feminists really this crazy nuts 
MensRights,1615950178,So you want men to be punished for rape and men to call out sexism when they see it That doesn t seem all that unreasonable  Isn t that what mens rights activists want from women too More punishment for those that commit crimes and for women to call out sexism against men Why would we downvote this person for asking for exactly what BOTH genders should have 
MensRights,1615950138, In society s eyes men are unclean while women are clean  Holy cow I never realized some people think this It used to be the other way round historically because of menstruation In many societies men were banned to bathe in the same pools women used because women were considered unclean Even today I wonder what argument can be made to consider men less clean than women because women menstruate while men don t hence men don t need all kinds of pads and tampons to stay clean but also because women spray urine differently than men who urinate with a clean narrow stream that can be directed straight into the drain It is really dubious that anybody can make a nature based argument Hygiene habits on the other hand very by person not by gender Most men are very clean as far as I know and I am one

MensRights,1615949960,Thanks that s really interesting  Neither of my sisters went through that kind of phase so I had no idea 
MensRights,1615949605,What they mean by  feminism or   female supremacy I call  female gender fascism or  feminist gender fascism  Just a little terminology clarification 
MensRights,1615949605,Assuming any reputable newspapers in the UK will touch this side of the story even with a ten foot pole now that they ve achieved success dividing the populace further and the clicks are rolling in Even The Times have surrendered to the hive mind by printing an anti male drawing 
MensRights,1615949429,Dude at this rate im just gonna change all my papers to be legally a woman
MensRights,1615949375,Yes to the exact same degree as women are Fair is fair 
MensRights,1615949334,Only because women wearing them made them  gender neutral  If women were socially banned from wearing men s cloths the same way men are socially banned from wearing women s clothes they wouldn t be  gender neutral  
MensRights,1615949258,Love this I received negativity a couple days ago for calling out a female only scholarship 
MensRights,1615949252,I think its smart to avoid having sex with ALL intoxicated women I don t think I m being bigoted in that advice to young men Its not worth the risk Most of them wouldn t contact police or claim that she was taken advantage of But I don t know which women will so its best to avoid sleeping with all drunk women  This is the same advice women extend to passing men in the street Probably not a bad person But not    percent so avoid the situation if you can

MensRights,1615948794,Abolish the Duluth Model Replace the VAWA model with The Violence Against Family Act like it used to be l Include Made to Penetrate in the definition of rape so that male victims can get justice Due process not just for false accusations but courts in general  Removing the bias against men in family court  Do not mention the name of the victim and perpetrator in rape cases before the accusation has been proven many times the court of public opinion is more dangerous than the actual court  Helping the Men in prison who get raped and sexually harrased on a daily basis but the media doesn t shine a single light on them 
MensRights,1615969316,I ve been doing that hence why you ve been replying lol Your type of mindset is weak and too optimistic expecting everything to just work out without any effort 
MensRights,1615969233,Oh absolutely Even if fringe kink scenes the disparity is plainly evident If the name of the game is numbers women are definitely far more catered to than men I m still not totally sure why it s not like the actual population of women is that much lower than men so how are there enough men to go around that women don t have to compete with each other The only thing I can think of is that men are less intimidated by the internet so there s a larger pool of men looking for women online Either that or desirability really is so one directional that they can actually create artificial scarcity   And you d be surprised about the  guys messaging girls thing Simps be simps There was a guy who pulled a little experiment he got pictures of an attractive friend  with her permission and made a dating profile filling in the blanks with obvious troll responses Like he named her  Gobby Lynne  and then streamed for an hour seeing how many guys he could get messages from with  effort Eventually it became so predictable that he started actively making himself  less attractive and the floodgates never stopped

MensRights,1615968294,It s a shit argument because it s utterly and completely irrelevant to  the degree of direct harm suffered by the male victim  the after effects of that harm suffered by the male victim  the male victim s need for support and assistance whether the perpetrator was a man or a woman When the topic of discussion is the victimization rate of men it s simply not very relevant There s also no such thing as  male violence  any more than there is  asian female opioid abuse  Women also commit violence not  male violence  but violence

MensRights,1615967926,Yeah it s pretty much totally irrelevant for a male victim whether the person who victimized him was a man or a woman  I was physically and emotionally abused even in public sometimes  Oh but was it a MAN or a WOMAN who did it Because if it was a woman then yeah these events are relevant to include in statistics but if it was a man then well you re a man too if you know what I m saying  
MensRights,1615967815,That  in  and  in  statistic is misleading The CDC study which came up with that expanded the definition of rape to include many more people One example is a sexual encounter counted as rape if you had drunk alcohol While I agree being black out drunk and unable to consent is rape having a bit of alcohol does not make it rape This counted up to a  rd if their total rape statistics

MensRights,1615964954,Bro  shorts hail in comparision to mini skirts The average length of shorts are about   inches meanwhile mini skirts are on average  inches or even shorter Also the reason why men don t wear skirts is because a hetrosexual man wearing a skirt isn t going to get with women  furthermore men have actually worn skirts in the past however those skirts were much more straight than female skirts Furthermore  you re just victim blaming  couldn t you say the same about wearing trousers in the    s Like do you seriously think women accepted other women who wear trousers Like I don t know why but this idea that discrimination of men is null if men discriminate against each other however even in this context women make fun of men too The reason why men don t wear skirts is because its not socially acceptable unless like in Ireland  its a different type of skirt  in addition  most men are hetrosexual  meaning if they want to get with women they have to be masculine Like men are attractive to women because they re men  women are attractive to men because they re women however saying your prefer feminine women is somehow a hot take in alot of circles I don t know man  you can prefer anyone you want however if you criticize someone s preferences meanwhile your preferences are the same then you are a hypocrite

MensRights,1615964348,Here s an idea for an argument Imposing matriarchy instead of gender equality Since I m a feminist I believe that  the world is patriarchal in nature in that men still have certain ethical grey areas where if you do it you re the man but if we do it we re  insert derogatory female slur here  However I also don t believe the world is still strictly patriarchal Gender roles are already comparatively fluid compared to   years ago Now the problem here is when  extreme feminists control their narrative it s always  We can do it too no matter the context Worse still this extreme side of feminism actually prohibits men from impeding on  female territory  removing the possibility of men being a victim while simultaneously stressing that women are too weak to be the aggressor Some have even gone as far as  we can do it better  but cry foul when they are presented the same amount of pressure that men have to deal with I guess my point is although I m a feminist I m very aware of the odd agenda of lowering standards with which women are compared against while the standards for men are getting higher We do need equity so men and women can stand as equals but unfortunately extreme ideals still impede that 
MensRights,1615964219, gt Yes shorts Shorts as short as miniskirts are extremely uncommon Even buying shorts shorter than knee length can be a challenge And that s assuming you think that shorts are as revealing as shorts in the first place  which they aren t   amp  x   B  gt And when men wear women s clothes they are much more likely to get made fun of by other men rather than women Even if that was true the problem is that society oppresses men not individuals of X or Y gender Please do not try to turn men s rights into  boys vs girls  men s rights are human rights

MensRights,1615971722,I guess the most common would be sexual expression and or sexual relationships It just means that the opinions of people towards men who  has game is different from the opinons towards women who are  too loose  Or maybe the opinion that a woman in a certain workplace can climb the ladder faster because they  slept with the boss whila a man  deserves it  Note that even women hold that opinion to other women at times And finally the question of  What was she wearing  and  Maybe he was provoked by what she was wearing  when a woman is sexually harrassed It s a nuanced and I admit shallow point but it s a nod towards favouring male supremacy in society  But like I said It s not inherently a patriarchal world anymore Things have changed But extreme feminists are pushing towards female supremacy while holding on to the societal bias if it works for them instead of finding a balance between the two sexes Please don t attack those minor  whataboutisms since they are only there for contrast The point of my comment is that the narrative gets skewed when females say  I am as strong as any man and  I am not strong enough to overpower a man so he cannot be the victim in the same breath in order to get a leg up in an argument

MensRights,1615976701,I ve literally had that exact argument with white supremacists before  One of them insisted that it wasn t racist to immediately throw all black applicants resumes in the trash because statistically they re more likely to be criminals and why would he want that for his business Never mind that background checks are a thing you can conduct on everybody  even a quick google search works most of the time  and that most black people are just  people who want to live their lives without being saddled without all this completely unnecessary racist bullshit But nope replace white supremacist with feminist and black people with men and suddenly people think it s okay Also I usually see people make this menkampf points to demonstrate when something is bigoted against men but why aren t these so called progressive feminists alarmed that a simple word substitution makes them sound like white supremacists 
MensRights,1615976659,Wish they taught girls how not to be only fans where s though 
MensRights,1615976568,There are probably just as many women doing it I can say from personal experience alone that women tend to be more frequently violent  but men tend to do more damage on average due to their physical strength   Also I think that provoking violence should be counted as a crime a woman is not a victim in my book if she was intentionally provoking violence  which they often do from my experience  
MensRights,1615976420,I remember when there was all this outrage on social media because SJW were saying its unfair to judge all Muslim people because the actions of a few And now it s actually the  law   to target all men because of the actions of a few 
MensRights,1615976351, gt dismantling the system of oppression Can anybody who actually says this articulate what they mean  I swear if I ask ten people what it means to dismantle the patriarchy I ll get twenty different answers This is one of the things that irks me about the gender studies rhetoric  It comes across as a lot of vague navel gazing better suited for a dissertation not solving real world problems 
MensRights,1615976186, gt E I d like to add the judge who gave Brock Turner The Rapist that sentence was a man who didn t want to ruin his life The girl s life doesn t matter though The problem is you see that as male privilege rather than attractive and rich privilege  Men are more likely to be arrested charged and convicted for just about every crime  Their sentences average    longer for the same crime and criminal record That judge lost their job over that decision Do you go around commenting about this case of attractive and rich privilege  No  It doesn t fit your worldview  
MensRights,1615976102,Modern women are allowed to wear a g string and child sized bras in public some are allowed to be shirtless I don t care but  there are kids around and I don t appreciate kids being scared because women are walking around with their chest needles and camel toe because they claim that it is their right to be ped s If a man dressed like borat at the beach he would get in trouble but with good reason women should also be held accountable for such indecency Mens rights is great for the basic rights that are not being met but it shouldn t copy the mistakes of feminism instead it should expose the injustices and limitations of feminism and how that hate movement directly oppress men 
MensRights,1615975881,But thats just because they like fetischizing and objectifying gay men no hypocrisy there
MensRights,1615975553,Main thing I ve noticed about men s rights groups compared to feminist groups is how civil and just they are We just want equality Some of these feminist sub refits I ve seen they are so malicious and horrible I m more worried about that group becoming serial killers tbh lol
MensRights,1615975445,The  out of  number comes from RAINN an organisation that does not recognise female on male rape Furthermore this is practically impossible as all types of crime have been decreasing furthermore the amount of reported rape cases total to about         a massive decrease from the     number of         Therefore that would mean the chances of being raped in     would         meaning the chances of the average man being a rapist is  out of every      men 
MensRights,1615975434,The lengths that you stated are wrong then You said   inches on average for shorts when your own source says that the shorter lengths are more common And for mini skirts it says  inches below the buttocks Not that they re  inches altogether I get what you re saying though and agree completely It definitely feels like men s clothing has stagnated and that s reflective of men s rights as a whole Listen do not go down the road of judging women based on what women in them subs say They are sexist opinions Most women respect that we have preferences I try to avoid them they only loss me off 
MensRights,1615975307,Agree with everything you said dude except that I think it s a bit late for  preventing gender fascism   it s already here That s the reason that women have noticed MGTOW because it s not men talking it s men  doing  
MensRights,1615975219,So do you have to be completely blacked out before you consider it rape What about if a lady consented then in the midst of the act tells the man to stop she doesn t want to continue and he doesn t stop Would that be considered rape Or what about a husband and wife where the wife says no and the husband threatens or yells at her until she says yes Would you consider that rape Im asking to try and understand what you would consider rape 
MensRights,1615975216,The problem with these people is that their tactic is not giving people equal rights but instead they seek to bring down the other gender and make them suffer as a result
MensRights,1615975058,I hope not but I wouldn t be surprised It shows how backwards things have become that they can ridicule a whole group of people and get any with it 
MensRights,1615975049,It wasn t  if they could get away with it   It was  if there eere no consequences at all   Plenty of men still wouldn t rape if they could get away with it but the victim would be traumatized 
MensRights,1615975037,To be fair the title says that     it will lead to far more discriminatory privilage     So there is already we just need more it not dicriminatory enough 
MensRights,1615975008,Murdered men don t live to tell the heartbreaking sexual assault story 
MensRights,1615975001,I guess thats true to be honest  how many women have complained about the male homicide rate About the injustice in family courts And the other dozen male issues    
MensRights,1615989895,Kinda do but it only comes up if someone shows that they ve been abused The scars from scratches were brutal Glad those fellas could make it out alive tho
MensRights,1615989743,If you think the statement   gt Men lead women follow This is the natural way of things is part of reality I have sad news for you your worldview is seriously fucked up and you need help I don t think you re evil or heinous or anything like that but that s a really degenerate baseless philosophy 
MensRights,1615989700, gt eventually say enough is enough    gt Sometimes the supposed  forces of good in a story treat an  evil character badly enough for long enough that the  evil character just gives up trying to show the heroes that they are not evil and becomes a villain for real 
MensRights,1615989492,Well  EqualWorkDay is just as accurate They can place EqualPayDay in march if they want but then they have to acknowledge that most of it is due to the women themselves But feminists don t want to put any responsibility on women It would have been much better to place  EqualPayDay in january and look into the other issues separately because as we see once we put everything together it s impossible to even know what the issue is People just end up thinking it s for the same job  amp  x   B Now just as you did I could have told the other MRA s around here that the   equal pay act  doesn t mean the issue is fixed but honestly I don t want anymore Feminists would which that we support them but you get blocked everywhere painted as hateful violent so why would I care I couldn t help even if I tried The only place where you can support  feminist goals honestly is on a MRA sub I do it occasionally if someone brings up the issue like here   But other than that I ll leave it to feminists to fix their shit 
MensRights,1615989328,I always fucking hate these things because they treat boys like they re future serial killers or rapists but girls are just pure 
MensRights,1615989095,They just won t leave us alone will they makes me wonder if Men are on their freaky minds every day and night not an iota of sensitivity or civility all blame no shame 
MensRights,1615988893,Most murder victims are men Therefore murder of men should be treated as an higher crime Same with false all gations against men Let s say that men should have a priority for mental health and drug services because most of suicide and over users of drugs are men After all it will make sense to do so 
MensRights,1615988716,Typical feminist Your only argument is  you ugly can t fuck  Sad for your dad for being brainwashed Making your own money maybe but you will probably never let go of a chance to steal from men with all the laws in favor of women  Men are not the issue Criminals are the danger for men And therefore let s do the reverse of what feminists try to do Exclude female victims of the talk and only doing things for male safety 
MensRights,1615988678, gt They rode the Brock Turner thing for half a decade but now they ve found something else that they can point to and pin on men Brock Turner and Wayne Couzens are shitty human beings and should be regarded as such I don t think most men are into raping women behind dumpsters and abducting and killing them so we should remember that Perhaps the better target should be national governments in Africa who tolerate FGM 
MensRights,1615988658,This entire down voted chain shouldn t have been down voted lol For raising valid points 
MensRights,1615988462,No there is an above the books to stricten the entire working environment for everyone Make everyone follow the letter of the rules It s a very scorched earth policy though as you would be burning good employees as well It s only a  hostile work environment if she can prove she s targeted 
MensRights,1615988437,Yeah well club culture in general is terrible for everyone Drugs and drinking will screw you up 
MensRights,1615988331,This probably needs it s own post It s too bad the author didn t report the results for the question that was actually about rape I get that  making a woman do something sexually that she didn t want to isn t much better  But I could imagine survey respondents answering  agree in the context of trying to convince a woman to say yes to a specific sex act  For example if it s oral sex offering to also go down on her in exchange for her going down on you I mean they re probably   questions deep at that point so who knows what s going through their mind when if they answer  strongly disagree for the question about rape but then put down  sightly agree to the question about sexual acts As the article points out putting those two questions side by side implies that the researcher is asking something a little different than what the question seems to imply on the surface 
MensRights,1615988326,Indeed Self esteem and an idea of one s self worth is always a good thing however overblown self esteem is a dangerous thing as it s breeds contempt for those you deem beneath you If a girl has a list of demands as long as her arm that no man can possible meet because it s been drilled into her by the prevailing social view   then she will end up alone childless and miserable 
MensRights,1615988304,There was never any intention to actually pass a law that prevents men from going out after  pm  The woman that voiced it was doing it to point out the hypocrisy of people saying women shouldn t go out late if they don t feel safe Although I haven t seen anyone actually say that But acting like this law was seriously under consideration is embarrassing
MensRights,1615988243,Ok that is probably one of the stupidest laws I ve seen in a Western country It almost feels like a sundown town doesn t it Men can be around at daytime but will get driven out by force at night Baroness Jones claims this will make men know how it feels for women   would the Baroness also be willing to live as a Black woman 
MensRights,1615988210,Lol I probably make triple your salary because my dad s a feminist and have always been told to make my own money Men are more likely to be killed by men so you agree men are the problem and are the main threat to mens lives Prize fool  I imagine on the other side of your sweaty grubby crumbed keyboard there sits a bitter and twisted man  because even with your  great personality  no woman wants to fuck you Would you like me to send you a drinks voucher so you can sit and wallow in your little pity party feeling ignored and sorry for yourself 
MensRights,1615988204,The stat isn t faulty The stat is accurate The justification is what can be faulty  Saying its entjrely due to discrimination is blatantly incorrect  That said I think saying  women choose lower paying jobs and take more time off so who cares is also faulty  Why do women have lower paying jobs and why do they take more time off  Assuming genders are equal its weird that so many women are missing so much more work and doing so much less overtime So drilling into that shoukd be the goal of feminists  Not painting it as discrimination alone Thats flawed logic 
MensRights,1615988070,No How many men do you know that dated girls under   when they were     They should have been held accountable for that and the majority  never are  This is the point I m trying to make Hold men accountable  
MensRights,1615988024,Men certainly have a sense of caution around women but it is a really weaker instinct than the reverse for women since the biological cost of a misjudgment is so much bigger for women  without modern inventions that is   Honestly men are better served by tapping into this instinct nowadays because we ve flipped over all the risks and potential costs to men with the help of technology as well as laws Think about it women have multiple unilateral birth control methods and even if they choose not to use any of them they are not burdened by parenthood Men on the other hand have access to one reliable but non unilateral birth control method condoms The only other option for them is to get a vasectomy And with that they can be burdened with parenthood based on the choices of anyone who gets access to their sperm They can literally get raped into parenthood How the hell do men muster the courage to even talk to a woman baffles me sometimes 
MensRights,1615987994,Domestic abuse sexism is common in Spain most often victims being women so yes it makes sense for Spain to do that 
MensRights,1615987986,I bet feminist teachers are salivating over the possible of government permission to practice misandry It s literally government sanction to mentally abuse male students for a paycheck 
MensRights,1615987977,I am also arguing that the wife in this case deserves a share in the combined income by right As the wife s effort in child rearing and cutting down on work hours helped the husband focus on his career despite being a father  wife performed indirect financial contribution  So akin to how investors collect profit a certain share in husbands money belongs to the wife 
MensRights,1615987831,Yet more  All men are trash feminist claptrap The thing is the more they try and drill this in  especially to teenage boys the more they will rebel against the  programming  It s what kids do I have a teenage son and he and most of his friends have no desire to be around girls because in his own words  they are insufferable to be around are entitled demean the boys at every opportunity and are supported by the teachers in this view  We are breeding a generation of boys who will disengage with society and women in particular all because we have let the feminist agenda run riot and tell them they are worthless EXCEPT as a means to support women s ambitions 
MensRights,1615987787,Kafka trap mate I don t know if you ve heard of that statement but Google it Nice lady just told me about that and I m so glad she did 
MensRights,1615987739,You have to define rape as well feminsit would say looking at a womans boobs is rape 
MensRights,1615987715,I have seen women beign victim blamed usually in rape cases Do you want to know a fun fact It s not only men that victim blame I have seen a lot of women doing the exact same thing saying the usual words  she sould have dressed more conservatively and all the other iteractions It s not  more men or more women that victim blame It s shitty people that victim blame In no way shape or form victim blaming is peculiar to one gender

MensRights,1615987421,Ocasio Cortez is always good for a laugh we ve yet to see if she s ever going to be good for anything else 
MensRights,1615987356,And you only have two comments and no posts for a year account yeah right
MensRights,1615987351,Obviously she was being so kind that she chose to only injure him instead of killing him
MensRights,1615987227,Yeah I don t use reddit because it is full of toxic folks who would not believe things that don t serve their narrative I came to comment since my picture is up there 
MensRights,1615987058,Exactly mate The same rules apply to men and I think why we ve become up in arms as well is because we re also so much more highly likely to be murdered in these situations We know this It s inherent for our survival you could say They re does need to be better policing sentences actually taking action on ALL crimes The world from its inception has always been violent you an I know this  maybe some people don t live in the real world aren t streetwise maybe not excusing anything here There s this victim blaming mentality about women being raped as well    it s erm    
MensRights,1615987050,Lot to unpack here Fathers are legally obligated to take care of their wives and children too I never said women shouldn t perform house work  If a husband already gave a huge amount of money to wife before divorce it can be deducted from alimony You are context dropping while using the difficulties of poor lower caste women as an argument You quoting poor lower caste women is like feminists saying LOOK LOOK AT THE WOMAN WHOSE RECTUM WAS PIERCED OUT DURING RAPE AND THEIR FACES GET ACID ATTACKED HoW DARE YOU FEEL SYMPATHY FOR MEN While you argue for mens rights And imagine a feminist repeatedly bringing up that argument when you talk of men s issues And saying DON T YOU CARE ABOUT RAPED AND TORTURED WOMEN when you talk about discrimination men face I think we can both agree that you thoroughly feel bad for women who get raped and I feel very bad for the hardships that poor women go through To imply that because I am arguing for alimony I somehow donot care about poor women is extremely disingenuous and an argument made in bad faith Err   i never said fathers aren t important I actually made an argument FOR  parent families in my comments Saying mothers primary care givers are important doesn t mean fathers are unnecessary or bad not wonderful After a divorce a woman no longer lives in the same house as the husband Also like you said house rent is compensated through house work We are talking about support that must extend after a divorce to a wife who chose continues to choose to focus on raising children instead of on a career 
MensRights,1615987008,Yes But it would be far easier to have that discussion if feminists didn t use faulty stats as always when they define  EqualPayDay If they had put  EqualPayDay mid to end of january I would have taken them seriously but these liars placed in in march I can play the game of faulty stats too let s talk about  EqualWorkDay Only difference I admit these are faulty stats and don t try to mislead anyone

MensRights,1615986842, gt  in          of men would rape if they knew they d get away with it  That statistic is incredibly misleading It really states that  in  college men would have sex with a random women with no strings attached if they could 
MensRights,1615986812,Wow That s terrible So sorry you re being dismissed and gaslit in this way 
MensRights,1615986680,I ve never heard an answer put so well thank you for this Kafka trap I didn t even know what one was but so grateful that I now do I think so many people easily fall into these traps of entertaining nonsense only further prolonging the nonsense especially nowadays  Just to note on the flip side I think there s a fear from men that women will break their hearts manipulate them cheat on them take advantage of them leave them when they re no longer of use which inevitably prolongs this fearful state leading them not wanting to get involved I think the majority of both sexes overall suffer quite a bit because of these fears ideologies and even dogma in some cases of what the other potential partner could possibly do even though statistically the odds of this are proven to be pretty low It s like the femme fatale thing for men    double edged sword  There s this fear on both sides of not wanting to get our hearts broken and potential grave danger It s kind of like our anxiety systems to warn us of saber tooth tigers  amp cavemen strangers they were good back in the day but they aren t really serving us now This leads to men not approaching and women feeling unapproachable  I d love to know your thoughts on this
MensRights,1615986410,     r MensRights comments koinom some sources on the sexual abuse of men and boys  r MensRights comments f tes  gender parity for sexual assault academic studies Another interesting fact is that most men who rape women were themselves sexually abused as boys by older women I don t have that link super handy right now but the UK empathy gap website has an article there about it  
MensRights,1615986398,Yes you were or you wouldn t have asked why someone didn t defend themselves You never ask about what the victim should have done 
MensRights,1615986327,No sir im not i was just curious to why Now i understand men in the west are being treated unfairly by the justice system

MensRights,1615986108,No I disagree Men are much more in danger and should be the focus of the conversation Who cares about women  feeling in danger while they are safe i want to make false all gation a misandrist crime And the all  you ugly and cannot fuck women insult  as if women could decide of my value while they cannot even decide if they are poor victims who need to steal men s money to live or if they are  strong independant women who need no men

MensRights,1615985971,I am a bit traditional in this regard I believe that modern work life doesn t do justice to children Then again I can understand parents wanting to work for financial reasons I think parents who can afford to  must spend time with their multiple children from childhood to when they are teenagers And not merely compromise during  infant years of a child s life  But yes alimony should be based on number of working hours spent compromised 
MensRights,1615985956,It is a punishable offense to make a false accusation moron Your first paragraph you agree with me so I d suggest articulating your   point better you thick f CK Also hardly a misandrist I love men especially tall funny rich ones The notches on my bed post corroborate this I just don t like rapists predators bald fat poor and boring ones I m guessing you fit within one of the latter

MensRights,1615984531,Just look up Caroline flack where she killed herself and suddenly the situation is focused on the bekind movement rather than being about male victims of domestic abuse  If that was a man who killed himself and a woman victim he would have been accused of killing himself to escape conviction
MensRights,1615984527,How do they expect people to learn then If you re posting in good faith even in disagreement I don t see what the big deal is We let feminists trolls say all kinds of bullshit over here But if you add your two cents in a respectful productive manner over there they ban you  That s doesn t seem very fair 
MensRights,1615984514,A study from Sweden looked at   years of violent crime and found   of people were responsible for    of the crimes In other words  person in    commits nearly twice as many violent crimes as the other   combined That s not really answering you question but Now you know

MensRights,1615984345,I have a slightly different perspective on this I belong to an ethnic minority and I have been wary in certain situations because of perceived threats or interactions so I am not unsympathetic to women feeling at risk and seeing it as an imposition on their freedoms However by the same token I did see this as a bit of the  missing white woman trope i e  black women were murdered in a London park in June      by a stranger That failed to capture the zeitgeist utterly and it really requires a degree of introspection by the Twitter warriors many of whom I am sure were supports of the BLM movement 
MensRights,1615984261,I went through the exact same thing as this guy for   years 
MensRights,1615984203,I don t know why you got downvoted I appreciate that you did actually put serious thinking into this and searched for current statistics That s like the main issue with people they accept what is given to them without questioning like the freaking article is from      do your research people 
MensRights,1615984187,Good old  I started attacking you but it doesn t count so you re the only violent one because you defended yourself  
MensRights,1615984180,There are so many examples here on reddit where men speak up and are accused of trying to silence women it s as though DV is the realm and owned by women 
MensRights,1615984172, gt why aren t these so called progressive feminists alarmed that a simple word substitution makes them sound like white supremacists They quote select crime statistics to show things like if a women is attacked then the perpetrator is very likely to be a man and they believe this justifies their hate Funnily racists do exactly the same to try and show that POC are more likely to commit a violent crime than white people So feminist rhetoric is pretty much the same as racists rhetoric and feminists justifications for their hateful views is the same as racists justifications for their hateful views 
MensRights,1615984136,I ALWAYS hear women complaining about being victim blamed but have NEVER actually seen it In Sarah Everard s case I ve only seen men hold the attacker accountable  like any sane human would   In some other cases it s just common sense not to walk in certain areas or do certain things at a particular time That goes for men and women The world will never be     safe and it is everyone s responsibly to be vigilant But even if someone is attacked I doubt hardly anyone will victim blame 
MensRights,1615984120,BUT could he defend himself against the court system the police and possibly males within her family or social circle People forget that if a woman comes forward to report something EVERYONE takes it quite serious 
MensRights,1615983896,About as many as there are men A roughly equal number of men report being raped by women as the other way around 
MensRights,1615983878,The problem is not men speaking up the problem is that when men speak up they aren t listened to I was raped and told when I went to police that it would be he said she said and so they wouldn t proceed with an investigation
MensRights,1615983674,Drinking leaves you in a state where you re mostly unable to defend yourself or recognize risks cause you to make stupid decisions that lead to danger I think that was this person s point Just as if he was completely drunk a man wouldn t see a problem going into a seriously screwed up part his the town wearing his whole rolex collection That s alcohol induced stupidity and it leaves you at risk Drinking screws up with your judgement so it should only be done in safe environments Of course nobody really does that thanks to club culture etc Being drunk yourself put you considerably more at risk than the average person being unable to defend yourself  poor judgement  reduced perception  being visibly weakened  It s the age old problem making it look like just because it s not directly YOUR fault you shouldn t be careful or care about risk reduction The way this person was phrasing it is absolute nonsense  women should receive consequences for doing the wrong thing what the hell particularly when said  consequences can lead to murder but this nonsensical sentence aside there s definitely a serious subject to be had about alcohol here and not only on the perpetrator s side Just because you re not at fault it doesn t mean that it s smart to avoid any precaution and being visibly drunk makes you an very easy target for the worst people out there Alcohol doesn t lead to nefarious activities but it does lead to being a victim of those Which is true for everyone Saying that  it s the other one that s at fault is a non subject since there will always be people like that and way more importantly having someone to be condemned afterward will not fix the fact that your nove have been broken you ve been stabbed you ve been raped So while the  women should receive consequences for doing the wrong thing  part is absolute nonsense the  if someone is going out and getting drunk they are trying to get into trouble isn t The only problem is that nowadays people seem to assume that the whole world has to be and can be a giant safe space and thus it s really hard to talk about this without dismissing it as  let they learn  which is needlessly cruel 
MensRights,1615983659,There s also a bunch of research showing why women make less money than men It comes down to hours worked job choice etc Economists have been saying this for the better part of   years now but nobody wants to listen to them That s why the argument always slides back to  why do women work less than men   When somehow gets twisted around as sexism against women instead of the fact that men get used in aggregate for their money by women 
MensRights,1615997426,Its not  bias against your opinion because X  Its mistrust due to you being a feminist   had my share of trusting this kind of people in my life and im not exactly inclined to do it ever again sorry  usually it ends badly Noone is entitled to be trusted 
MensRights,1615997339,Nah that s just your feminist indoctrination kicking in Crimes against women are not because of hatred of women or their condition as women crimes are always caused by a myriad of other conditions emotional outbursts chance defense response You and your feminist gang just prefer to remove women from the situation and entirely demonize men in whatever situation they are in Hate crimes do not exist and are just another invention to abuse the legal system into tagging everything as a hate crime when men do it 
MensRights,1615997259,To be fair that happens both ways The difference is men get laughed at or humiliated by both most men and women Unless there s a lot of evidence most of the time law enforcement doesn t proceed with a prosecution Obviously it still happens but it isn t  a high percentage Now college is a different thing An accusation is enough to get you kicked out The other thing is if it gets out a  certain number of people will never believe you Sorry you weren t believed It s an awful feeling

MensRights,1615997069,Okay now you re sounding more and more stupid with this example This isn t even about  fairness anymore it s about thinking people  should be held accountable  for what you think is right or not according to your own biases Pitiful And bowing down to people that are also part of the problem themselves isn t  being part of the solution  No matter how  some women feel 
MensRights,1615997022,There s no consistent possible way that can assure everyone that a crime is committed because of someone being a man or a woman hence this entire concept is just idealistic and impossible to enforce in reality Since the concept of  hatred is so subjective and non defined this will just be perfectly abused and missused 
MensRights,1615996989,Isn t that what an ally is supposed to do though Learning all you can about the ideology you re trying to advocate In addition your obvious bias against my opinion because I am a girl and  feminist isn t that a part of what men s rights advocacy is trying to eradicate for your gender It s a common thread in the posts here that I ve read THEY DISREGARD OR DISRESPECT MY OPINION THEY BANNED ME THEY TAKE STANDS AGAINST ME JUST BECAUSE I AM A MAN Yet here you are doing the same Even going as far as insulting me as a person nonetheless 
MensRights,1615996611,I m not gonna address all of those but men don t make fun of other men for having hyper sexuality That is what feminist and the media do

MensRights,1615993835,Many men have committed suicide or considered it over  getting cancelled over a false accusation of rape so you may want to rethink how much it effects people The research on how many rapes go unreported you re referencing can t actually detect it although I think it s true that it s a large percentage and probably a majority But that s also true of false accusations Ignoring that shows a large flaw in your reasoning here 
MensRights,1615993786,Never heard of her before looked her up OMFG that is crazy She was alleged to have abused her boyfriend  was going to be prosecuted for it and she killed herself and the ENTIRE focus is on how the system let HER down  not the boyfriend There is no way in hell that if the genders were reversed that there would be any mention of this stuff 
MensRights,1615993573,To add to your statement about equal custody laws if a woman knowingly puts a mans name who is not the father this should be at least a misdemeanor as of current it is non punishable You can sue to get the money that you paid for ie child support but you may not win
MensRights,1615993306,Fair point I think a certain minimal alimony is justified if the lesser paid category is continuing to compromise on career to raise children However all these forms of calculation should be rational I donot think people deserve a share in assets they did not help in building

MensRights,1615992725,If you clarified that asset sharing justifies reduction elimination of alimony I doubt you would get any argument here The problem is that in US divorces  the lesser earning spouse gets BOTH asset sharing AND alimony 
MensRights,1615992481, gt First one The fact is cops kill black men less when you look at kills per    k encounters You know what they say about statistics There are two kinds lies and damn lies It s so easy to pick the statistic which seems to support your claim the best It s no surprise that the prevailing narrative has been forcing people to look at the  deaths per X white people vs  deaths per X black people  And it s because it s the only statistics which would seem to indicate anti black racism If you look at flat numbers far more white people are killed by the police each year than black people So they account for relative population size But then like you pointed out if you also account for relative number of police encounters black people are actually killed by the police  less often than white people So of course they ignore  that factor Include any factor which makes it look  more like black people are being discriminated against Ignore any factor which makes it look  less like black people are being discriminated against Profit It s disgusting through and through 
MensRights,1615992476,I don t believe we need any kind of compensation It s like a cycle of violence we need to be the grown ups and stop it right there and then yeah it s toxic that they consider Men the enemy but if we do the same we will be no better If a woman truly advocates for equality then I won t shame her for that

MensRights,1615992120,We are talking about HATE crimes Are most murders against men because they are men No its because someone wants to kill or Rob for the hell of it Plus most perpetrators are MEN A big portion of crime against women and rapes are hate crimes They re done out of hating women and wanting to show that men are above women Silencing voices It s the same with BIPOC and LGBTQ communities Some murders happen just because someone was in the wrong place wrong time but many have a motive behind it Crime aginist women in Spain was due to them being women most often

MensRights,1615991917,What people fail to understand is that while men had more authority power in life in the past they also had more responsibility Example Claim In      women couldn t vote and had little power over their marriage  Counterclaim Yes and if the wife rang up    k in debt the man could go to prison for it He was responsible for her behavior period And that s ignoring the good citizen requirements like fire brigades etc Also many MEN could not vote so    Authority and responsibility Men have been losing authority to women for ages but they ve retained responibility  thanks Feminists  That s why things are so skewed right now Authority and responsibility being severed

MensRights,1615991474,I literally have a graduate degree in research methods lmao nice try Specifically I have a lot of experience with survey research which is where most of this stuff comes from and can t actually gather data on false accusations for methodological reasons That s why I am able to casually dismiss this stuff and can point out specifics for any paper For that specific meta analysis it s only of  papers which isn t a strong meta analysis at all I can t read it or the papers it references so I can t go into details but it doesn t mention the rate of proven true accusations either it lumps it in with equivocal cases and admits it can t actually say what the false accusation rate is in the final sentence of the abstract There is also pressure on police departments to not investigate accusations to the point where they can be proven false because of pressure from feminists who think revealing the rate of false accusation would make women less likely to report true cases That may be true but men still deserve justice for the false accusations that do occur and deserve the right to be protected from false accusations through punishing false accusers Anything else is sexist Police anecdotally say false accusations are common when under anonymity as well as lawyers that participate in divorce court These are some reasons why you can t investigate these things with a survey of police records or a survey of people themselves

MensRights,1615990619,That s a very interesting take  How strong is that instinct that women feel that men could attack them take advantage of them physically sexually how predominant is that When you say we re better served by tapping into this instinct what do you mean and how do you mean it It is crazy I can definitely see why it could baffle you lol I can tell you now that it s their desire to f ck That s it It s the drive or desire to mate Well do pretty mad stuff to get what want  men s sex drives they say are higher how strong are women s drives to have a baby Is it part of their DNA to want to do that So many questions lol
MensRights,1615990513,Regardless of how you want to twist that around I think this statement explains a better part of the wage gap  gt Men choose to work more because of social pressures to earn money to spend on women Something like    of women admit to never dating a man who has less money than them  It is a huge part of how dating and marriage works  And men respond by sacrificing much more for their careers than women do You can think of it as the pressure that women feel to put on makeup and be pretty

MensRights,1615999390,No you should treat EVERYONE as potential robbers it the point 
MensRights,1615999241,Okay here s a simple breakdown Your thoughts are too logical to even consider doing something heinous Which means you think before you do On the other hand the same cannot be said for other people Let me call it something juvenile you do not have crime brain But that is also why us as females or in this case even you guys should know it pays to be vigilant because we do not know which of those around us has the  crime brain  
MensRights,1615999241,Rape shouldn t be the main focus here Don t go out in the dark And don t be careless if you are Doesn t matter if it is rape or an assault just don t go out in the dark in a sketchy area without protection unless you want your kneecaps to be bashed off 
MensRights,1615999217,Lmao hilarious Obviously you didn t know this but women use the phrase  all men to imply that it is impossible to distinguish the so called  good men from the bad men until it s too late When men insist that  not all men are rapists pedophiles murders etc it is clear that their statements are redundant What use is knowing that not all men are bad when so many women are being abused Instead of vehemently arguing the semantics of the phrase work with women to actually change the facts because the reality is women  are becoming victims of abuse at the hands of men at incredibly high rates 
MensRights,1615999208,Why do people always downplay what happens to men by saying that it happens to women too There was no evidence because they didn t want to collect the evidence

MensRights,1615999087,Which also tells why these people usually don t say anything her friend that said this probably was either very courageous or didn t expect this reaction they d be accused of this even more than random people with feminists probably parroting that they didn t love their children Or that they taught her  internalized misogyny that made her think so 
MensRights,1615998928,I ve seen more men closed fist punched in the face more times than I care to count 
MensRights,1615998927,A colleague of mine actually put up a post saying it was revolting and must be hard for that girls family seeing so many man haters using what happened to her to force there agenda and within minutes he was accused of victim blaming misogyny gaslighting and other assorted shite just because he said her family wouldn t appreciate it
MensRights,1615998923,I find myself falling into typical male roles without realizing working way to many hours so I can take care of everything because I feel like im responsible for everyone s well being I went  months in between jobs once and felt like i didnt deserve to be a man I dont know what any of that means but it can t be healthy 
MensRights,1615998833,Well like I said that s fine That mistrust towards feminists in particular is one thing I learned then Not asking to be trusted  I d find it odd if you trusted me Just asking to not be labelled self centred just because I want to learn these views and opinions Gender equality is just a big thing in my life right now so I m trying to learn all I can about everyone s thoughts Because you can meet a feminist in the streets but guys are less up front about their thoughts on gender

MensRights,1615998509,How surprising This being said if they wanted to create misogyny they wouldn t do it any other way These people are the ones that are the biggest disservice to real victims down the line Damn modern pseudo  activists  Also it s related to both their famous  rape culture and the  risk management  victim blaming phenomenon  How funny for them to say that justice itself somehow holds the length of her skirt against a victim when if there s a  rape culture  which is defined as a society that ignores downplay  and normalize rape of course sentencing something is normalizing it  don t bother  it is in fact towards men raped by women  not other men these ones are more or less recognized  Nice role reversal here The kind of people saying this are just narcissistic that are so unable to understand what everyone else is going through that they immediatly think that anything that happens  or don t even happen in the case of the skirt is an attack towards either them or their  labels  Who cares about the fact that women on men rape are pretty much a joke and that the law is explicitly biased against men regarding this which skews with the statistics not believing ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING that comes out of my mouth unconditionally means that there s a rape culture   
MensRights,1615998247,So if I could recount the several times I ve been abused not just physically by a woman I would to whoever would record these events into our statistics but most of these happenings are from over   yrs ago I am now married to someone much more sympathetic and understanding than the women who opted to hurt me  But I can say that each time  I wanted to reach out I was told how futile that effort would be by councillors and police  They knew all to well that my side would not be taken into consideration and I would in fact be the one incarcerated  For over a year I dared not fight back Bruises scratches manipulation insults and hurled objects  she did not stop and always insisted I was the abuser  I struggled for years to find a healthy relationship often falling back in with another abusive type  Thankfully I am here today happy and healthy with my new family Things are much better and I am grateful that this experience taught me how to avoid such vile women 
MensRights,1615998246,I m whining about facts I mean I never ever ever whine and when I do it s cause I ve had enough I m just venting and it s cause I do nothing wrong and still get bitched at for basically having a Y chromosome People make this sub so that people CAN say these kinda things I think if you use any common sense you would know that Someone made this because men aren t allowed to say anything anymore without being the worst person in the world So people use this place to vent If you don t like what s said here then get the fuck out

MensRights,1615997860,That makes sense I just I see alot of this but I actually tried looking up cases where someone got off by saying that and couldn t find anything then when I tried pointing this out I was threatened to have my work contacted to get me sacked just for pointing out facts
MensRights,1615997760,Some idiots saying this probably exist just as you ll find idiots defending everything  although they d manage to make even this gendered somehow  But implying that a broken justice that manages to get men in jail for years for false accusations somehow  let  real rapists go because hey she was wearing a skirt  What are these people smoking The system is broken to the point where an innocent can possibly be jailed on a woman s word alone and yet somehow justice itself is supposed to be biased THIS way Is this some kind of joke 
MensRights,1615997680,I m more likely to be robbed by a black man should i treat all black men as potential robbers 
MensRights,1615997670,I thought domestic abuse was illegal Why don t they say at the end of the article that if u are a male victim go to the police None of the advice lines fill me with enough confidence to use Untill men get reproductive rights not just responsibility this will continue to get worse With the welfare state and social responsibility at an all time low 
MensRights,1615997546,I will never forget when a female friend of mine said to our group of friends that she punched her ex in the face during their break up and told him he couldn t call the police as they d think it was self defence and arrest him instead She couldn t see why this was an issue I was screaming internally 
MensRights,1615997532,I tried pointing out something similar recently too I was responding to somebody that was talking as if the presence of a woman automatically meant there s immediate danger of being falsely accused and all the shennigans we know are real What bugged me was prejudice I argued that this automatic collective judgement of women was no different from the  we know it s not all men but we don t know WHICH men  misandrist bs on twitter sparked by the recent tragic murder of Sarah Everard As a result I got downvoted I agree with most of the posts and comments on this sub and find it a great opportunity however we seem to be allowing the exact same slip ups as feminism although the extent is smaller as of now We are allowing collective judgement of people based on their gender because it suits our narrative I find that to be cowardly I guess this place isn t     perfect but really no place ever is 
MensRights,1615997521,That s what I was thinking has any guy actually ever said this Because where I am from if you tried to use that in court you d be crucified

MensRights,1616883283,Not how it works  the court gets an enforcement fee back later from fed government usually     Meaning they get more as the more you are forced to pay along with every other poor bastard   billion dollar industry
MensRights,1616883276,Ok who s fault is it that there is no UN men account Its not the people behind the women s account so stop trying to make them look bad The problem with this sub is that all the people here talk and complain about these things but LITERALLY DON T DO ANYTHING TO FIX THEM

MensRights,1616882707,Some people and for society I think a critical mass are very genitally focussed Thinking about sex usually in its most base forms takes up most of their thinking and so personality This is true for men and women but women seem often to dislike being seen in a base sexual way whilst enjoying seeing others that way Whilst I find such sociatally encouraged hypersexualised sorts to be as disappointing in character as cocaine users I do pity those women who want to act out in this hypersexualised manner but fight to be seen as more interesting and less sexualised This contradiction must make them quite unhappy I suggest you learn from these people Steer clear but learn Decide consciously how you will handle sex in your life and don t pump up your sex drive with society s preapproved lifestyle Sex is fine but it is hardly the most important part of your life or character Even of your relationships with others Almost everything about you is more interesting and fulfilling than your cock Sex beyond children  which is a whole other minefield  is just a bit of fun rivaled by a good meal Don t make sex the most part of who you are Don t define yourself by your genitals Leave that game to  society  and go it your own way 
MensRights,1616882651,The title of this post does not really align with the body The title makes it seem like women live completely perfect lives never face adversity and have no problems and you take issue with implications that they do The body of the post however is pointing out the double standards of the body positivity movement All I want to know is if you generally don t like things that address problems women have or if you just don t like this example 
MensRights,1616882631,Well men bottle it up I used to get hit for crying as a kid out of frustration off my dad I ve forgiven him for that and I don t think he was happy doing that but that s maybe how his dad taught treated him It s like a negative cycle or something that s passed down Sometimes it s easier to physically shut something up than to try and understand it That s like a brutally honest way of describing something like that  I ve heard stories of bullies that bullied kids who went onto be World Champions in the UFC Years later that champion has gone onto see his bully homeless and how years ago when GSP s  champion dad went round to this bullies house to ask to ask his son to stop bullying GSP his dad beat the living  out of his kid GSP s bully was taught how to communicate with his fists  If you cry too it seems like you re not keeping it together But it s more of not being able to suppress it any longer  Men can explode too because they bottle it all up If I just naturally expressed how I feel you wouldn t like it put it that way it s like spitting out a tornado It can be easily misinterpreted as well cause maybe men struggle to make sense of their emotions But if you picture it like soda in a bottle and if it s shaken shaken shaken there s a way to defuse the fizz and it can easily go everywhere if it s not done properly that s how I see it  I cried in front of my GF once because I was about to walk out on her I looked over and she was smiling I said  look at you laughing you don t even care do you  I put her on the spot and I explained why I d been doing all the things I d be doing and expressed myself naturally  minutes later she was in pieces breaking her heart out on my chest crying saying  she can t do this without me and later said she was laughing because she was scared scared of me walking out However she finished me a week later but men and women deal with their emotions differently maybe it s a biological thing or a generational thing but it s not always easy for a man to make sense of his emotions never mind the people around him so he usually locks em up and you ll just see occasionally outbursts every now and then That s how I can make sense of my emotions Past experiences understanding dealing with them and sharing them properly It s not always easy
MensRights,1616882570,People being dicks to eachother I don t think you understand why I am saying this Toxic masculinity sounds like men being nasty because toxic means being nasty or a bully and masculinity is how men behave and stuff like that we don t say  Toxic femininity to describe female sexism do we It overall sounds like a bad name and we just want people to stop using it It isint hard
MensRights,1616882304,Cancel culture is so toxic    It s good you re not ashamed and I have no intention of shaming you Just so we re clear The internet is really confusing  Have you found any women that agree with these ideas I imagine that many would not is that true 
MensRights,1616882001,First thing you need to do to solve your  issues is stop believing in the feminist  toxic masculinity dogma   The whole point of  toxic masculinity is to shift the responsibility of women s behavior towards men into the men themselves Masculinity is not toxic it s the feminist attitudes towards masculinity that are toxic It s the toxic feminist ideology that is trying to impose an unnatural and divisive anti male society that s at fault A system of thought and invented discriminatory practices in feminist ideology culture and economy that feminists call the patriarchy and toxic masculinity The term toxic masculinity is part of the feminist ideology that sees male behaviour within a context of the patriarchy and denies as much as possible that it is    the result of biological differences and    that typical male behaviour is  human behaviour Toxic masculinity isn t about masculinity at all it s all about the negative stereotypes that all men are accused of simply because they are men Men dont hide their emotions because of  Toxic Masculinity  They hide them because no one cares Well that s the problem You take the time to call it Toxic Masculinity when  sexism  oppression and  misandry are preexisting words that fit But for some reason you don t want to use those words     Toxic masculinity was originally created by the mythopoetic men s movement with a completely different definition The mythopoets believed that society was forcing boys to be feminine instead of letting them be themselves   Feminists twisted the definition  by demanding men be more feminine and deciding that they know what s best for men  The feminist definition of toxic masculinity is a backlash against the growing number of men speaking up 
MensRights,1616881991,buzzfeed lol heard they ve been losing money  the past couple years it cant happen fast enough tho   
MensRights,1616881831,I identify as a feminist because I agree with the definition of social political and economic equality of males and females A lot of feminists don t like my attitudes but I d ruffle the feathers of MRAs too because I think a lot of them don t understand feminism I m quite happy looking at both sides Many of the more well read MRAs and feminists would agree on a lot of issues I don t think feminism is marketed well and the name doesn t help because people do easily misunderstand it including many feminists  I identify as a feminist so when I find someone who claims to be feminist who obviously doesn t care at all about men s issues I say they re not feminist They don t like that
MensRights,1616881733,Ok I ll copy and paste it here when I see it again No problem won t take too long Just gotta wait for an unsuspecting feminist to post here asking for some information

MensRights,1616881474,I don t need feminism to be a good friend As I said somewhere else feminism is also about recognizing men s feelings and acknowledging that they can have mental health issues or that thay can be taken advantage of or abused by other people This is just example of addressing these specific issues that I wrote about in other comment 
MensRights,1616881444,Saw a commercial on Hulu about women recently losing    million jobs due to the coronavirus Went on to claim how much better the workplace is with women in it and how we need to work to get them employed again I know it s women s history month but still

MensRights,1616881112,By every metric men are more often the victims of violence compared to women  Hell DV stats break  down like this     is reciprocal both parties are violent  and    of reciprocal violence is initiated by women     is a woman abusing a man     is a man abusing a woman Even rape statistics  when you include women raping men are gender equal 
MensRights,1616881001,I think that s a big part of it pun intended her lack of penis  So she s being a dick to people that have dicks because she doesn t have a dick   What a twat 
MensRights,1616880976,YES I m so glad you agree on this  That is unbelievably refreshing  I m not sure what exactly I wanted to discuss I think that it s mostly about the male experience as it is obviously foreign to me Or something about specific topics such as the forced suppression of emotions etc due to society s standards of what  makes a man a man   It s mostly out of curiosity I m ignorant about the topic and I just want to learn  amp grow 
MensRights,1616880975,There are all demonstrations of male disposability and gynocentrism  Believe it  Otherwise you will go through the world wonder  Why do these things keep happening

MensRights,1616880820,i don t see it as bigotry just like i wouldn t see a group that targets specifically male mental health as bigotry either
MensRights,1616880807,Yes Twitter posts the gender breakdown of their  employees as a requirement of submitting an eeo  report You can find the numbers on Statista

MensRights,1616880477,Some quick Googling showed me that a man is     x as likely to be homeless as a Fortune    CEO and twice as likely to be homeless as a business owner of any kind YMMV because those numbers fluctuate a bit depending on how exactly they re defined But regardless the point is just what you said  If you roll the dice the average man is more likely to be struggling than he is to be Don Draper 
MensRights,1616880449,Why generalize I just don t want to have an argument over the internet it s exhausting Nobody learns from them it s just further polarizing  amp alienating is it not To me debate has somewhat of a connotation to it I imagine facebook comment sections just tearing into each other only making counterarguments But If it s a respectful debate sure I d love to hear your points But if it s an argument back and forth nobody is growing  I m a fan of seeing others simply as humans with a different take on  reality and thats it I want to humanize people if that makes sense  To achieve societal growth and progress in the realm of equity  amp general peace then we must listen to each other

MensRights,1616880225,You know that would generate a lot of backlash and be a PR nightmare 
MensRights,1616880188,Well yes it appears you do Its been proven repeatedly that women make less because of their own choices and nothing else When an algorithm assigns work with no knowledge of gender men still earn more  about the same gap as the popular wage gap  Uber literally pays men and women the same and assigns work based on an algorithm
MensRights,1616879791,well your language till now has only given off that vibe   no matter what your opinion focus on the way you talk if you don t want to come across as a dick   To you casual sex might be useless but to others it is not women are not hollow sex dolls that are left empty after being pounded we are not fkn objects
MensRights,1616879609,the reason the twitter group is for females is because they make up they are a minority in the tech industry it s not that deep 
MensRights,1616879489,You say you don t want a debate then in saying what you want you describe a good healthy debate I guess you could say that s one of the  myriad things feminism teaches that I have a problem with Debate is about reasoned arguments and argument is about logically supporting a position Neither of these things are negatives yet because they give weight to impartiality feminism gives them a negative connotation because in feminism  partiality is an ethic Feminism corrupts the foundations of everything it touches 
MensRights,1616879470,The pinned post tells men to  Listen to women don t interrupt women repeat   The second says don t buy from straight white men  By advocating buying only from women pocs lgbt etc Other posts link to social justice panels mention gender gap with digs at white men  I admit they try to reign it in a bit but it s definitely prescribes to and espouses misandrist ideology 
MensRights,1616879205,Be honest   you re here to troll aren t you   The constant pushing of everything for women  not even a minority of the population when the same don t exist for men is sexist Its like the United Nations account  as sexist as it gets On international men s day all they could being themselves to tweet was  something about male allies who support women  just insane And of course a UN women account but no account for men 
MensRights,1616879084,It s even worse as a woman because everyone automatically associates me supporting things like the Australian Britney Higgins case with me supporting things like that book It s really difficult to stand up for things that matter when there s stuff like this

MensRights,1616878706,Since Twitter woman is for women and so then the rest of the Twitter is for men eh boss  
MensRights,1616878435,Insane logic Why would a corporate account have any gendered voice at all Why would it even be representative of employees generally  The main account Is there to make announcements from marketing  mostly female  their managers  mostly female  rubber stamped by the executive  mostly male  In any case    of Twitter employees are female A company is more than it s engineers

MensRights,1616877954,Yes I think you got it all right I am sorry for confusion but yes for me feminist became insult which is of course incredibly stupid and sad Under term   feminist I imagine a woman that is using feminism as protection from any man or other counter arguements while bringing nothing valid to the table Driven purely by emotions and ideas not based in reality But I to be honest I think this must be caused by environment I grew up that is post communist country At least here in Czech republic from my perspective I do not see any inequality  or I am not at least fed it by media that should or can be eradicated That is why from my point of view feminists have no major reason to fight  I am sorry if I insulted you in any way and I am open to further explanation if required

MensRights,1616886915,Can I add onto this Because I ve noticed something If you pay enough attention  This goes for all  gangs and societies what happened is the Police and the criminals have mutual respect It tends to be more respect if they are part of a group like the Mafia or Hell s Angels Then again they do the bad crimes not the BAD crimes Yes there s a difference

MensRights,1616886411,I ll never take ownership for trying to solve the issue because I feel like it s difficult as a woman to do but I would absolutely be willing to help in any way I can The only way I feel like I can help is to listen to all sides of the issue and have conversations to try and help men and women understand each other better   but here goes I live in a small town with one industry Women face a lot of abuse here and there are resources available but it really bugs me that there is little for the men to turn to when they need help What little resources are available the men in the community may not feel comfortable admitting that they need help  For example a man loses his high paying laborious job and ends up at the bar trying to figure out how he will support his family Wife leaves with the kids and he is now in more debt with a spiralling alcohol drug addiction It s a common narrative which also leaves men in this area afraid to be vulnerable or work to make a relationship happen Because of this women blame men for shitty cyclical behaviour and also leaves women afraid to be vulnerable as well  After typing this it s probably a more common narrative everywhere It just really irritates me that the resources are minimal at best I feel like all I can do as a woman is to just show up for those people that call on me for help and I feel really thankful that I ve been able to help my male friends through their depression I also feel thankful that my male friends and I can have these conversations and they can take it back to their place of work for other men I lurk because I care about both sides of the coin Where I feel like we all fail in gender equality is the lack of willingness to communicate and empathize with each other It is a systemic issue What s good for one group is good for the other

MensRights,1616885202,Have you heard any feminist rhetoric It is all us vs them State the exact issues for which you seek opinions 
MensRights,1616884980,I guess I need to elaborate It is social stigma that draws from an ideal of what manhood is This ideal says that men must be always ready for sex at anytime must be stoic and not show emotions They must be independant always in control often in a dominant position in a relationship They must like sports and physical activity and constantly be looking for relationships and power They must also show off that power to others to proove themselves They must remain calm at all times except in some cases where they need to use their anger to protect those they care about  That s a grey area I personally don t understand so the ideal goes  All of this together creates and encourages stereotypes and expectstions that are put onto men which in turn oppresses them

MensRights,1616884681,Well put it this way I could be planning on killing myself and you d never know Extremely good at hiding it  Yeah I mean her response was a bit messed up but it was an act I wasn t acting and later on her true response came out I ve seen women play off stuff like pretending to be strong and that s all good   but you can only keep that up for so long You can only run away from your feelings for so long So that s why I take what people say with a pinch of salt because what they say and what actually is are two different things People lie so    you cant always believe what people say  With regards to your boyfriend that s good I can only speak for me personally but I d love actual support someone to he there for me Someone to listen and try and understand A lot of men have the weight of the world on their shoulders and you wouldn t even know it But seeing things from his side sticking by him when it s tough listening and trying to understand him not taking things personal is pretty helpful for both sides I d say 
MensRights,1616884615,They have been proudly introducing feminist bias into wikipedia for many years Go watch the wikimedia youtube videos linked here  
MensRights,1616884303,Idk if ppl r aware but the article appears to be a criticism of the book 
MensRights,1616884303,That s the definition That s about the  th time I have seen a different definition for this term and the how men should behave can be grouped into sexism in general so their is no need for either terms If you were to say women belong in a kitchen it s sexism but if men belong in construction its somehow toxic masculinity Yeah the whole term is a mess and should just be replaced with something that dosent give off such a bad vibe
MensRights,1616884235,Oh the double standards are everywhere If you re a man losing your hair  guys who are will know how painful it can be you will get women be out and out dismissive or even nasty about it  nobody bats an eyelid Those same women will go on about their body positivity stuff or post their  be kind memes I can think of a few short words I could use to describe them and none of them are good One of the things about feminism is that for a lot of women its a very convenient excuse to get ahead and to have complete power E g power of selection politically established in feminism   that guy I dont find attractive is being creepy by showing me interest  for example Women know that they have a lot of things better in life but they ll happily ignore those bits when fighting for their  equality  Now I m not saying there is never a case for women s rights movements because some things women shouldn t have to deal with but modern feminism is toxic and a lot of these women really aren t nice people See that female dating strategy sub for an example   if that were a sub by men about women it would be banned  they re as toxic as its possible to become 
MensRights,1616884091, Treating into each other in debate is quite literally not debate That would at best fall under the  ad hominem attack which is a logical fallacy While moderators of late have failed in this their job in a formal debate is literally to ensure all arguments are based in logic and reason  I understand that Kamala Harris implied that debate is all about destroying you opponent when she explained how she can go from the denigrating Biden in the primaries to being his VP but she s wrong 
MensRights,1616884081,It s not how men behave its a stereotype about how men should behave that s forced onto people I actually would be open to saying that their is also a  toxic femininity  but it would be uncomparable to toxic masculinity because of how different it is 
MensRights,1616884059,That is exactly point of feminism You have an idea that   feminist is a woman Absolutely not true  e g the psychologist Honza Vojtko   a woman driven by emotions It makes us feel degraded to just nonrational beings who aren t capable of rational arguing And to point out some inequality in Czechia  the recent affair when Blatn refused to allow Polish women to get an aborting in CZ changed is view only after the public started complaining  there is much less women in politics       in parliament in       Definitely not the      that we should aim for  Radim Uzel and his influence   Touching women s ass is okay helps with relationships in the working space   Rape has always been here and always will  Stereotypes like  Men are aggressive women should beware them   His interview on DVTV is absolutely terrifying  doctors not allowing women to get sterilezed as  They may change their mind  was discussed in the group I describe lower  body shaming slut shaming virgin shaming  stereotypes of any kind If you want to see my and Czech feminists perspective  not radical no KMA here  you can check  pun not intended out the group Everyday Patriarchy Bullshit on facebook It should be public joining isn t mandatory to see the posts As the name suggests it mainly shows everyday little things that are against equality For non czechs let me describe some of the  recent posts   picture of dirty hands from repairing a car or something and the text  If your man s hand never look like this you re dating a girl   Notice the point of posting this to this group is to mock the picture so it s point is to  fight against the stereotype  men should be dirty else they are not manly enough    picture of some coach in gym women who bend themselves such that their genitals are exposed he touches them  to help  and again joking text  I d looooove to have this job  pictures from language textbook promoting stereotypes  the pic that was also popular on Reddit with Google translate assuming genders for neutral pronouns  a discussion about the information that    of male r pe is caused by another man  the OP is asking for resources for this Resource searching is kinda often in there This is where my journey of a feminist began so that s why I m recommending this to you The group is very welcoming and supports debate so if you want to pose some question there it shouldn t be a problem  Personally I believe that in Czechia women aren t opressed systematically or something There is a lot of sexism coming from older generation  e g our professor telling us that women should not study  my specialization   but we re doing pretty okay Countries like India Poland Sudan and many more African Asian countries need feminism desparately more Also you haven t insulted me it s ok Maybe we well meet again in a discussion at EPB 
MensRights,1616884041,Lol well they may not think feminism is what it actually is You guys taught me that but I have a pretty tough skin so I looked past being called a feminazi bitch whore cunt and saw the info you gave and I decided that I m not a feminist But many wouldn t stick around after being bullied like that That s my point 
MensRights,1616884028,Considering I wouldn t let mine back in the house after committing domestic violence I filed with CPS filed a protection order and filed for stalking before she decided to make the accusation I m hoping they see it as retaliation on her end

MensRights,1616883807,It means solipsism The bias some individuals have in which they think other people have to be exactly like them But I don t think solipsism is the right word as it means something really different Anthropomorphism is a human bias in which we re likely to assume human characteristics feelings thoughts intents personalities incentives or physical shape to animals or aliens Gynomorphism is the adaptation of that word to describe women or people who tend to think men are like women I m ESL tho so take this with a grain of salt 
MensRights,1616883795,You realise the United Nations is an absolutely massive political organisation right When there is sexism against men  and that s what it is when you share tweets like they did on international men s day coming from that level then there s very little anyone here can do besides call it out I know that I and many others did on their account but most guys know right now that men s issues are not considered as important as women s and that men are considered more disposable in the western world  why we will always hear far more about supposed gender pay gaps than male suicide or homelessness rates for example  or just that they could have the gall to make that tweet on the one day meant for men  I think more and men will get angry and point things out but it will take time for anyone to take it seriously such is the level of mainstream misandry Tbh it will come full circle eventually and feminists are acting as their own worst enemies  but again  for now men will continue to be sh t upon

MensRights,1616883403,I can definitely see this Most of my friends are guys and it s a lot more challenging for them to open up My boyfriend took quite a while when he cries I hold him tight like an actually supportive SO So I suppose many women see it from your GFs perspective because he was suprised It still really sucks that you have to bottle it up And her response was pretty fucked IMO  It also really makes it a lot harder to actually seek help if there s something going on  Actually a couple hours I talked to one of my best friends because he seemed  closed off  resistant to emotional vulnerability He opened up finally almost in tears telling me all that s going on in his life In that instant I watched the detrimental effects of the  real men don t cry bullshit unfold  Do you think that men s mental health is often overlooked because of this I thought my friend was just feeling  weird off and I had no idea he was really depressed Also everyone I ve ever personally known who has committed suicide is male I don t think that s a coincidence

MensRights,1616899767,It s not so much being against feminism in its ideal   which is equality   as it is being against misandry which has always been lurking in the background Old ant feminists saw this The next generation got fooled The goal of radical feminism which is now just called feminism has always been to eradicate some imagined wrong and create a world where men are second class citizens No one is fighting for equality anymore They re fighting for superiority now that they have equality Of course they argue that equality hasn t been achieved so they can keep fighting But what they re fighting for now is domination

MensRights,1616894322,I grew up in a home where gender norms didn t exist I raised by a single mom who was a  tom boy  Crying has never been emasculating to me It s just something that happens  Now that I m in digital psychology and neuromarketing with years of study in clinical psychology I can honestly say the problem with men has never been a fear of feeling feminine  If such fear exists then it s not the root cause and can t be fixed by telling them to stop Just like telling a depressed person to stop being depressed won t help them either  It s the fear of negative emotions which is completely common between both genders  In every school of behavioral psychology we learn that the core behavior that continues mental health disorders like depression and anxiety is the evasion of feeling negative emotions  The ability to heal a disorder is directly proportionate to the person s ability to confront painful thoughts and memories  It s not due to some nameless or cureless disease The number of biological causes of depression and anxiety is few and far between They can also be found with a common blood test  Since these two disorders are very common within the female gender we can see it s a prevalent issue for them as well  What causes a lot of confusion is that there are two ways that mental health disorders can be expressed  There is a direct expression and an indirect expression  A direct expression is feeling insecure about your weight and forming an eating disorder  An indirect expression is feeling insecure about your weight and becoming a workaholic in order to achieve success and feel better about yourself  One is seen as a good quality because it can t be directly tied to the person s insecurity and the other can be directly identified as an effect of their insecurity  So men to make up for their lack of comfort with negative emotions tend to armor themselves by denying its existence This causes them to become unfeeling and many times unknowingly depressed  Women don t necessarily deny its existence but they avoid dealing with the issue  I don t want to talk about think about it  This doesn t deny the existence of depression but they re unable to fully deal with it until their painful memories are dealt with  This a very watered down version of the issue It s far more complex than this  Self alienation can cause layer upon layer upon layer of direct or indirect expressions of mental disorders  even mixing them up Said this way the  fear of crying affects both genders equally They re just expressed differently most of the time  Both genders should be acknowledging the importance of facing painful emotions and being completely honest with themselves  It s very tiring to hear this being called a gender specific issue

MensRights,1616894228,   I m    and very slim and in shape due to being skilled trades and my job is very physically demanding But all my childhood I was a very husky boy and very uncomfortable with my body growing up As a young lad you want nothing more than girls attention and to be the stud of your gang In highschool still being husky and uncomfortable with my body I turned to anorexia  amp working out excessively I slimmed down an alarming rate by my junior year     I now attracted girls I now was the stud of my gang but I still couldn t shake that feeling of  I hate my body I m uncomfortable showing it  Even now that I m a decently attractive young man with his own place and a stellar job I still live with  I hate my body I m nothing any woman could want  Being body shamed as a man will mess up your thoughts for a long time even life and it is not okay Body shaming is wrong no matter the gender but I would say it definitely hurts me more being male     I m now in the best shape I ve ever been but still uncomfortable with my body because I m not absolutely jacked I m      and now that I m skinny I have some parts of me are boney On top of all the negativity surrounding of just being a man Sorry for the wall of text of my life story

MensRights,1616893652,Honestly I feel bad when I read all these comments All these people who don t know what they are talking about Who don t see the problem   I m getting tired Too many men into feminist bs and think that  women need help and because we are more privileged than them just like they say then pro women  equality and those who say otherwise are wrong like wow    I hope things will change but it will take a LOT of time
MensRights,1616893501,No one wanted to vote for Hillary Clinton except for the majority of people who voted in the     US presidential ejection She won the majority of the votes but not the electoral college So you re right that most Americans don t have a problem voting for a women for president because they already did I m not saying whether or not that s a good thing  But if you think that most Americans wouldn t vote for a corrupt candidate and you think Clinton is corrupt then that doesn t make sense 
MensRights,1616893484,Greta wasn t really mocking kind of making an actual joke Don t be a feminist it s just a joke The comment   Hahaaa Now men will take the climate change seriously   was shitty though   That was just being sexist 
MensRights,1616893432,Maybe maybe not But your refusal to even try makes me think that you don t really know what you re talking about and are just arguing based on feelings and what you ve been told by other Feminists Of course if you want to prove me wrong you re welcome to make a proper argument 
MensRights,1616893373,Ehhh not nearly as much feminism has some genuine people who actually care about equality but with fds it is not possible to be a part of if you re not a piece of shit

MensRights,1616892860,I m a woman and I can explain We want to say  equal rights for woman So we take it from how a man would feel We of course don t know how a man would feel how would we This is feminist being thinking that all men are tough and never get abused in any way in which a woman would   Men have it just the same I m proud of the men who have been abused and still March forward     This is mostly my opinion hopefully I didn t confuse or upset anybody goodbye

MensRights,1616892734,Damn Well now I feel like caveman discovering fire I personally did not encounter most of these Czech specific examples you made which concerns me  Your point about Czechias older generation is painfully accurate Especially current political and educational situation is afflicted by old perspective from communist era I am more interested in politics and I got to say its terrible to see how current goverment operates Hopefully covid   helped enough to tilt the scales and during this year elections more progressive party will be elected  About my apologizes about insulting I do not know how backwards I am myself in comparation with other people on the social media Sometimes it shows up and I cannot fully explain to person in question why I have such opinion Sometimes its even amplified by the fact that many people automatically assume I am American I personally do not use Facebook much but I will definitely go and check out your mentioned group  It is sad how many people have completely wrong idea what means to fight for feminisms idea but that is todays reality where everyone wants feeling of individuality no matter what tainting reputation of others in the process or disregarding cultural or historical differences Hopefully this will change with future years

MensRights,1616892626,See my other comment Saying that Twitter doesn t prevent you is stupid and besides the point since they are only following trends 
MensRights,1616892611,The modern left s goal is the complete eradication of standards and merit where everyone s lifestyle is celebrated no matter how unhealthy and morally wrong it is By thinking that there was a problem with being overweight you were buying into the myth of being fit is healthier By trying to improve yourself you were imposing standards on yourself that made her uncomfortable with her own lack of progress Ultimately the modern left is a movement for people with no desire to better themselves seeking to justify their own laziness Everything is about the abdication of responsibility and placing the blame on people in society who do take personal initiative 
MensRights,1616892182,Meh that s a lot of it Not pure distilled and cristalized 
MensRights,1616892110,Being a bit more dismissive of some  problems that are only solved by ones own capabilities would help society Men are expected to solve their own shit for the most part anyway  There are problems but you shouldn t expect when you cry that people always come running to solve them for you Too many women think so and are infantilized further by postmodern narratives Too few women in x positions Work harder Bad body image Fix your shit Fear walking alone at night Carry a weapon or be smarter  I hear the victim blaming sirens already 
MensRights,1616891987,Well a lot of ppl would just loose their mind because feminism yk even tho it wouldn t be wrong But Twitter knows it wouldn t be well received so they don t do it Just a PR thing

MensRights,1616891680,Whoah Thank you so much This is seriously  enlightening    how are feminists so wrong Why do they want to create a world they hate Again not a generalization some feminists are great I m just talking abt the ones that aren t    Something like the narcissistic love of the tragic self That s how I d put it 
MensRights,1616891518, gt As a young woman I have often really feared being alone in public especially at night Many of my male friends do not share this feeling So would you say that s misandry at work Those male friends need to be more careful I always stay vigilant at night I understand that women should be careful at night it s better to be safe than sorry However the facts show that men are more likely to be violently attacked or and killed   Most people men included do not think of this I wouldn t generalize on feminist  points having basis especially now    E g    Equal pay  the stats are misconstrued    Domestic violence  Roughly equal women are more violent in some jurisdictions       text Based   on   the   rates   that rate   of   perpetration  C   but   when      text Based   on   the   rates   that rate   of   perpetration  C   but   when   Equal education More women are enrolled in university including in medicine nursing     A lot of Feminist talking points are either weirdly distorted or flat out wrong

MensRights,1616891494,Wtf do you think people can do about it except talking about it  It s like the comment saying that  you just have to make one just get hired by Twitter and make the account like wtf  Would you say the exact same if the gender were reversed  I don t think so You wouldn t have such a tirade about  just be the change you want to do Like why the UN would make an account for women and not for men  You are not actually answering that because you know there is not an answer that wouldn t look bad We couldn t care less about  the guys who are behind the account  nobody is talking about that so stop this shitty dogwhistle Now good job at least now you know that yeah people on Reddit complain about problems now guess what you don t know anybody here you don t know if somebody is actually trying to make things change and maybe if nothing is changing it could be because it s way harder than you think it is especially with people like you who can t take this kind of issue seriously Like come on were you seriously talking about equality on your first comment  How tf having one account on female empowerment is  about equality  Oh yeah right because you are so into the feminist propaganda that you automatically associate feminism with  equality even in cases were it s not even when people try to tell you Honestly just explaining from A to Z why such a thing is just a symptom of men and women in society and how a lot of men like you have just a weird internalized sexism mechanic where they think women problems are serious and stuff but not men s would be just too long to explain but stop thinking that women are fragile ppl that need help and men s don t They are humans just like us capable of the same things they need support but so do men and if you want to believe in true equality you should think about that

MensRights,1616890692,yes and i m sure men are allowed to follow and engage with that twitter account as well
MensRights,1616890643,And you re not showing any sympathy for the men who get attacked You re just blaming men for being the majority of victims because the attackers are also male It s victim blaming 
MensRights,1616908031,It s simple  voting rights privileges were given to men who paid with obligation to draft and subscription No such balanced act from feminists  they want the privilege but without the price of obligation
MensRights,1616907931,Huh Are you by chance a baby who s gotten hold of someone s Reddit account 
MensRights,1616907884,There was a really stupid ad i think it was by dove but I don t remember where women tried on pants and they were sizes like  radiant and  powerful but they are obese I understand not everyone can have a super model body type and it is harmful to redirect everyone to look a certain way but let s not warp reality and say that big women are some kind of alt healthy I m over weight and I m not particularly ashamed of it I have a half eaten box of girl scout cookies in my lap right now but twisting it so that big women are radiant queens and big men are just fat is ridiculous and will get women hurt because people are constantly telling them they are healthy instead of suggesting to maybe put down the block of cheese

MensRights,1616907786,I kinda have to agree with them on this one Women wanna be sexually satisfied as much as men 
MensRights,1616907589,Thats great to hear and I applaud you for it My posts are just my analysis of the  Me work hard and to be chad and me get the women There is an underlying theme here that the women is still the boss cause you  Rhetorical here are busting your ass to fit their paradigm of how sexual dynamics should be You are submitting to their idea of how the sexual marketplace should be 
MensRights,1616907437,Yep this happens to my little sis all the time and it s terrible Some woman are pleasant and not viscous but the rest will turn any group into a toxic group via gossiping I don t hate them for this it s just a facet of human nature It s been mentioned here before that it holds back their own gender immensely It s gotten worse given social media

MensRights,1616907266,Sure work hard to make yourself good I can agree with you on that But all this still brings to my mind that you are working hard to make yourself a prize dog begging for a woman to pick you In the past we had arranged marriages or war booty and all No preening to make yourself a prize dog for a woman Maybe preening to be seen as a prize by a fellow male 
MensRights,1616907254,Serving half of   years is better than nothing  We see women get away with absolutely zero punishment for raping boys on daily basis My only concern is that her co defendant a man was sentenced to   years in prison while this bitch only got   years That s some bias right there

MensRights,1616906847,Feminists don t wonder dude They don t give a shit  I m sorry but don t waste more of your thoughts or energy on this They are living rent free in your head  These women are bottom of the barrel anyway Lol 
MensRights,1616906844,Dude do you realise how fucking messed up that is Try reversing the roles Rape is rape and the rape of a child should be a death sentence in my opinion 
MensRights,1616906804,That point of view you have is good but that s not feminism Feminism really isn t against all sexism It still fights for what is  equality  but the view of what equality is shifts a lot A quick google search for the definition of feminism says this  the advocacy of   women s rights  on the basis of the equality of the sexes  You could say you fight for equality  That would encompass being against all sexism  but saying feminism means you will advocate only for women Saying feminism fights against misandry is just the wrong definition 
MensRights,1616906747,This raises an important point that is often overlooked Because of diversity men and women will be on a spectrum of physical characteristics and consequently some will be dismissed from interaction because their characteristics do not match perceived desirable parameters This may be considered reasonable choice and a perfectly natural situation yet it means people are suffering through no fault of their own We take steps to try to give people with a disability a better more equal life yet we ignore those with the disability of not matching desirability expectations Choosing to not interact with a man with a micro penis is not body shaming but personal choice criticising a man for a characteristic outside his control is body shaming The same goes for women Having said that personal choice is influenced by many factors it is not something that is developed in isolation Unfortunately society pays little attention to managing those factors so that we don t influence people to be unnecessarily discriminatory encouraging the twiggy look to be flavour of the month in terms of desirability is just a single example that is destructive We also do nothing to facilitate those who are judged as less desirable to have a similar quality of life as the rest of the population It all seems to be very  survival of the fittest orientated and not   st Century progressive civilisation orientated and it breeds the contempt of  F you Jack I m okay  In the case of micro penis for example we can point out that it doesn t prevent a man from being able to satisfy a woman unless the only way for her to be satisfied is with only a large genuine penis  ever considered a dildo  and a relationship usually consists of more than simply sex  for a woman at least  We don t want to generate pity but the recognition of flexibility and options in the achievement of goals that are more inclusive and not less There has been far too much emphasis in society of only one way to skin a cat and anyone not using that single approach being unworthy of consideration Society needs to recognise that it s goal is to support all of its members to have the best quality of life that is practically achievable  also respecting the environment not the deliberate creation of division between haves and have nots So many women complaining about the lack of  good men and not considering that their standards or expectations may be set unrealistically Society is partly to blame for not encouraging or educating realistic standards and expectations 
MensRights,1616906561,Oppression is a thing The problem is that people believe that only certain groups are oppressed and they are allowed to do anything they want while those that are believed to be the oppressor can do nothing but take it In the past if you believed you were oppressed try and take down your oppressor Your oppressor will then try and beat you back down Thats how it works  Feminisms and a lot of sides but I won t go into it is making people believe that fighting back is bad cause its evil and oppression but they are allowed to do whatever they want to you the one they call oppressor
MensRights,1616906479,they aren t feminists they re misandrists if someone hates the other gender just for existing they don t want equality they want superiority

MensRights,1616906273,Oh yeah If you don t believe voting should be right to all who do you think should have the  privilege  to vote 
MensRights,1616906220,Classic feminist bias They really believe that   Only men are bad and   Men are only bad If you ask feminists for examples of behavior that demonstrates  toxic masculinity  they can quickly rattle off a long list But if you ask feminists for examples of positive masculinity they re stumped They can t come up with any description of positive masculinity because they can t imagine that one exists If you try to prompt them by suggesting some traits that are usually considered aspects of positive masculinity such as stoicism being protective of anyone weaker emotional stability self sacrifice for their family etc then feminists will handwave them away by saying  None of those are gendered They re just positive attributes of people in general  Got that Only negative traits are gendered and they re always gendered male Positive traits are either gendered female or are non gendered So goes feminism

MensRights,1616905216,So you are ok with a version of  gender equality  where thongs are unfair to men  Then why are feminists fighting for equal pay especially in physically demanding jobs like sports engineering etc Biology is also at play in these situations But that doesn t stop feminists fighting for  equity    We are also fighting for the same  equity     Lets see for how long the society keeps gaslighting men before too many men know about the truth That the  equality that they are supporting doesn t include men 
MensRights,1616905077,I can sort of see your point that s why I think  blue pill or  gamma is usually a more accurate term for what the person means than  beta    But I think the whole concept of  oppression is just Cultural Marxism  We need to view reality as what it is  You have to make compromises in life and sometimes you get beaten down  Some will call it  oppression and wallow in it Others will try to make the best of their situations 
MensRights,1616905073,reddit is mostly comprised of men so maybe it s because most male reddit users don t think they need activism and why is it bigotry that one activist group has less followers than another

MensRights,1616904205,I don t know if all women back in the old days hated ALL men to be honest  Wording is always tricky to interpret  a hundred people might have    ways to interpret the same thing  Hates all is definitely not a good thing  Hates all men  Hates all women  Hates all children  Or hates all feminists  If some feminists started hating all men and you now start hating all feminists or even women that s going to be a vicious hate cycle which never resolves the issue  I empathize with women who were treated badly in the old days Just like I empathize with men who are accused of being evil by the post modern feminists nowadays  I think it s not fair for you to pay for that    men who built an establishment to control women and other peasant men I think that s where feminists got it wrong But as all humans everyone has cognitive biases  The problem is never everyone thinks himself herself being right the problem is everyone thinks everyone else being wrong  The world is never black and white Learning to understand and accept makes you different from a typical hatred feminist

MensRights,1616903430,Ok so you get mad at feminism because SOME feminists happen to try overpower women instead of fighting for equality You know the one thing we mostly say when we someone says something about men  not all men  Well guess what not all feminists are trying to have woman overpower men so you need to stop getting THAT pissed over someone not finding any problem with a feminist account Btw if you really think the problem is solely on the fact that this account is only for women tell me how is there no problem in this sub being only about men s rights There s nothing wrong with HAVING someone be there to fight for equality for women cause there are some aspects of life where men are more in power and vice versa Btw you try shifting the role of the one making the tirade to me when you literally type  paragraphs here

MensRights,1616903263,Okay I will not be doing this What was said has been said oh and also as I reread my text it does seem as I was being rude by saying  fun fact  and calling your thoughts toxic I do apologise for that if it seemed rude But besides that I have nothing else to say I ve said what needed to be said 
MensRights,1616903149,Its not hypocrisy its hierarchy  The powerful do what they want against the weak enemies 
MensRights,1616903143,I say becoming a man is a male thing Women hate the feminine men raised by women That should be enough to hammer the point home 
MensRights,1616902762,I see So you are basically saying to not react and to accept what you are or change yourself to be better if you don t like what you are Am I right here And yeah I have been saying on here that we should ignore women s pov of how masculinity or whatever should be They are not men they have no place to say anything The problem is that they can impose that via the state and academia and media onto people and said people will accept it for many reasons like credentials or its accepted by everyone they know so they accept it etc 
MensRights,1616902476,That s not my point at all My point is that women target something that s true in reality and name it something derogatory But just like women bitching about being called a Karen Drawing attention to the fact you feel strongly about it Actually makes it a target It s basically a giant bullseye The fact is men exist on a spectrum How you call it is irrelevant Those lower down will always object  If you really mean what you say that women don t get to define masculinity Then outright ignore the attempt Let it not even register Their opinions are irrelevant  Wear what you are as armour so it can never be used to hurt you  Tyrion

MensRights,1616902181,What changes did western pressure cause I don t know much about what happens in nigeria apart from boko haram  I do know that the UN specifically gives food to starving women but not starving men Idk if they ve done that in nigeria 
MensRights,1616902070,Sure But why though must women be allowed to determine anything in said hierarchy Said hierarchy is between men not women Just as women say that men have no right to do or say anything about how women act or what they decide to do So should men also not allow women to have any such say in how men act or what they decide to do Otherwise you are basically saying that men must subject themselves to female determination of how men are and should be and that this makes you chad or alpha for doing so 
MensRights,1616901844,Here is another fun fact Everybody knows I m right Super lucky

MensRights,1616913505,Unfortunately although your comment was indeed clear simple and straightforward there is some difficulty in justifiably assigning to it the fourth of the epithets you applied to the statement inasmuch as the precise correlation between the information you communicated and the facts insofar as they can be determined and demonstrated is such as to cause epistemological problems of sufficient magnitude as to lay upon the logical and semantic resources of the English language a heavier burden than they can reasonably be expected to bear

MensRights,1616911636,I m not sure I agree As a society we should   make  this rape  I m not sure the provable elements would meet the current legal definition but we make up that definition  but if you reverse the genders I don t think it needs to be rape Why the apparent double standard Simple because the status quo overpenalizes individuals who happen to be male for engaging in male behavior I strongly believe that sex criminals should be equally male and female because  heterosexual sex itself requires both a male and female partner Our society should strive to create a system where participation in an activity necessary for the continuation of life does not engender a greater risk of imprisonment for anyone because of their gender Otherwise we are not receiving equal burden of law nor equal protection of law as potential victims But perhaps it is simply not possible to make gender neutral rape laws unless we grade on a curve Put differently part of what makes the ex in this story a good candidate for penalization is the fact that this this accusation is beyond the pale coming from a male victim talking about a female alleged perpetrator    out of      women will never be accused of doing anything like this   Males not so much There are plenty of males being nominated as potential sex criminals We could be more selective about who we choose to make into an example   Currently If this changes the law should change accordingly

MensRights,1616908754,When do feminists invade gay male spaces  Feminists are having a hard enough time keeping spaces for lesbians  My opinion about feminists who say feminism is for everyone or for men  They re full of shit The proof is in the behavior Talk is cheap Feminism is for the liberation of women and it s ok for women to center themselves I m sure that the way the NCFM operates also  I don t think I need to justify or excuse the behavior of any feminist who isn t me or any group I don t support with time money or membership Really you want me to explain the dumb shit lib fems get up to  I can t figure it out myself  Now I m not much of an organizer and I don t get out much But I ve supported men s causes with money Which is about the only way I can show support to anyone Just Detention Innocence Project and  in  have all gotten support from me I also donate monthly to an org that helps families of men who ve been injured or killed on the job 
MensRights,1616908636,Sure I can agree with what you did and how you did it But here is the thing this sexual marketplace that supposed chads are working to win is for the interest of women Thats my point Our ancestors did not submit to this bs Submitting to the Sexual Marketplace is basically submitting to women and their standards and what they want and demand Thats whats so hilarious to me about the whole chad ideal  Women still have the supremacy no matter how you slice it Its still matriarchy

MensRights,1616926154,I m predicting right now that eventually we ll get a comment on this thread accusing us of validating each other s beliefs and the person commenting will have absolutely no self awareness 
MensRights,1616925557, Exactly Like you said there should be a platform to discuss men s issues but sadly this ain t it Most of the people aren t only interested in bashing radical feminists but to use any information to validate their hatred for women as a whole Sadly you see a lot more of the  see this is why women are evil stupid weak as opposed to more rational lines of reasoning  This is furthered when you see that anyone who engages in critical discussion is shot down immediately with anger and aggression They are only interested in validating their inherent misogyny and have no time for critical thinking 
MensRights,1616925437,She only ended up getting sentenced for  of her  charges  gt In exchange for the plea the remaining charges in the six count indictment alleging rape and aggravated incest were dismissed No other charges will be brought against Krueger 
MensRights,1616925363,This but due to legal reasons for many places As many legal systems refer to the presence use of a penis in order to classify and distinguish rape from sexual assault  or whatever local terminology is used  publishers cannot legally state otherwise without opening themselves up to libel suits as the law doesn t confirm any such statements It s extremely inconsistent especially for so many places touting  equality across the boards but unfortunately how things are 
MensRights,1616925357,She was only sentenced this long because of the victims age and because she is ugly

MensRights,1616924936,I completely agree I only came across this subreddit by accident and thought for sure it couldn t be as bad as it looked Unfortunately it just seems to be a group of men who thrive off asserting each other s beliefs that they they are oppressed and anyone who thinks otherwise is a misandrist It s just a cry for attention Whenever any social movement pops up there are always people who feel offended it isn t about them It s the same reason the  all lives matter movement exists They would be much better off addressing actual issues as I assume this subreddit was intended to do Unfortunately from looking through the posts it s mostly about bashing clearly rare radical feminists who represent the movement no more than an otter does 
MensRights,1616924927,Theyll say it s bad because of racism and because black people are oppressed White men according to them aren t so it s not as bad
MensRights,1616924795,How about both just learn to understand each other rather than either one or the other fundamentally change 
MensRights,1616924440,Ah but see that would be expecting reason and logic on this sub Sadly you set your standards too high These people are incapable of thinking rationally on this subject because they aren t led by the information rather they are led by hatred and seek the information to validate that Very much led by their emotions which is ironic considering that s a frequent put down they use about women  Although what cracks me up is the fact that they seem  so surprised that suicide rates are higher than homicide rates as male perpetrators That suggests  that they have lower expectations of men than the average person Which perhaps gives some insight behind their attitudes self hatred and projection 
MensRights,1616924365,I can t tell if you re being sarcastic or not but in case not no men generally  at least in my experience as one working in heavy industry do not talk about such things and in the cases where one of the boys  there is a distinction being made in my language here brings something like this up the men will generally tell him to grow up get on with it and not be so shallow though not in so many words If an online male space  were such a thing allowed to exist have a similar but gender flipped conversation you can be assured that space would be    d in very short order   
MensRights,1616923792,I like it  Calling it  the source of envy is a little to on the nose 
MensRights,1616923710,OK so women can t be charged with rape except as a party of commission but in the scenario above she would be charged with  causing sexual activity without consent and as the situation caused the victim s penis to penetrate a vagina the perpetrator would be liable on conviction to a sentence of life in prison Whether the police would do anything in response to such a report is a universal question in every country missandry and gynocentrism are not unique to the UK   
MensRights,1616923628,I think I ll call it oppression stick from now on
MensRights,1616923255,I believe all people are equal if you think that s misandrist then that s on you I m sorry you feel the need to make every social movement about yourself  perhaps it is because you do not feel represented and that is a horrible feeling I know  As much as it is hard to imagine in this day and age women are repeatedly blamed for their own assaults and murders Just look in one comment section of a true crime drama or even on this very subreddit I m sure And even if it doesn t happen today it has still happened in the past and lingers on people s minds  I explained my points clearly and politely I never once insinuated that you were in the wrong yet you chose to attack me That is not the proper way to win an argument Women have a right to be scared of men And men have a right to be scared of women Women just don t get so uptight about it I think the fact that the subreddit  feminism has less members than this one shows its not as big a problem as you think I will never knowingly group a people together and state they are all the same That s simply not true Everyone has their own thoughts and beliefs I emolore you to do the same Not every women trying earnestly to get their point across wants to degrade men  There are many men issues that need addressing Single fathers being outcast male nurses being mocked Unfortunately however a lot of angry people on the internet spend more time attacking the reladicals of what they perceive to be  all feminists  who are in fact just like men who commit crimes against women the minioity than doing anything about it Please can you re read my arguments again after calming down I know when people are upset it s easy to read things in a nasty or condescending tone  I just want you to assess my point critically before giving in to your want to defend yourself If  not all men is true which it is then you have nothing to defend against There is no need to get defensive as you clearly did in the last sentance of your last comment 
MensRights,1616923069, gt Why are the expectations for men  from women primarily  Because women control sexual reproduction A perfect example of this is   Note that this was before women got the vote and the leading suffragettes were involved in starting it It shows that women always had social power and always used it to shame men into doing the dull dirty and dangerous work by using the threat of reproductive exclusion Likewise it was women that drove the prohibition movement in the     s   using the exact same mechanism albeight this time even more explicitly  amp  x   B The same dynamic is at work today for example if a man speaks about  his experience with a violent female partner   or when women  outright celebrate and glorify such violence    amp  x   B  gt those in power are the ones that set the expectations for society right Depends on how you define  power  As described above women have always had the social power to shame men into compliance by shaming them as being  not real men and thus not eligable for reproduction This pattern is in active use today throughout the feminist movement to shut down men and gain the upper hand for example  Australian Senator uses  mansplaining to shame male politician   Accusations such as  male fragility   male privilege   muh historical oppression etc pp are direct decendants of this modus operandi   amp  x   B  gt that s why conservatively minded stubborn people have trouble accepting new ideas Nice conservative shaming you snuck in there The fact that change is not always and automatically for the better but that things can actually get worse and then might be anywhere from difficult to impossible to fix is conveniently absent from your analysis Conservatives know this and therefore opt to proceed with caution  amp  x   B  gt And again feminism is a very broad and muddy term Again this is no coincidence since it allows feminists to use hyperaggressive tactics and then hide behind the dictionary definition For example the genocidal feminism that runs all the way from radical  nd wave feminism  Andrea Dworkin Sally Miller Gearhardt etc right down to todays  Men are obsolete   The future is female etc When a man correctly calls out this genocidal hate movement for what it is the respective feminist will drop back to  but feminism is about equality   How dare you be against equality   lt insert standard man shaming as per above here gt  It is exactly this  agress and cloak dynamic I spotted and called out in your post above

MensRights,1616921146,No  I m saying the opposite I m saying  while yes sex with consenting  or pursuing  teenagers must be illegal  it ISN T rape and calling it such diminishes actual rape I have a friend from childhood who in her   s broke down crying over what happened   years earlier   not over the sex  but over the fact that her parents and the law ruined his life with the sex offender registry I saw a story of a woman whose life was ruined because her parents and the law put the man she would later marry on that registry 
MensRights,1616921122,It touches upon how our society teaches people that the female way of communicating is the only  right way 
MensRights,1616921110,I didn t say you had said that I have heard it elsewhere though multiple times Women are scared on the street because historically they have been told they have to be When that poor woman in Britain got murdered my local newspaper ran a story on how  women could protect themselves and gave a list of things not to do all of which would never be given to a man Women have been blamed for their own death because of what they were wearing or where they were Men are rarely blamed for their own murders  On average women are weaker and less able to defend themselves from attack which increases nerves Also again  and I mean specifically in a street situation they are more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted This whole thing was brought up because a woman who had taken every precaution that are published in those silly  protect yourself articles was still not safe If you use the logic that men should be equally as scared as women because they re more likely to get murdered then yeah you are right But there is a reason men are not as scared Men are not as scared as women because they are not constantly told they should be scared They are never warned they may be assaulted when they leave the house because they re shorts are too short They re never blamed for being murded when they walk through a dark park on their way home When a man is murdered by a woman and it makes headline news the top trending hashtag on twitter isn t  notallwomen I hope you read this and do not think it is an attack on you or indeed  all men  Most men are lovely unfortunately thet cannot erase the damage that has already been done over hundreds of years Just because    of men are nice doesn t mean women can just suddenly stop being afraid Also the constant assertion of men  again not all men and not you bashing feminists and shouting about how  they wouldn t do it does not help the overall movement If you have a pill bottle and   pills contain sugar but  contains cyanide you aren t going to feel comfortable taking one of those pills Especially if all the sugar pills say  defiantly not cyanide on them 
MensRights,1616920776,Feminist treats men like broken women their standards of living must also be ours The story I shared shows how men s emotions don t need to be expressed the same as women s and that it can result in a beautiful tale all the same Feminism tries to regulate men s emotions This story is an example of how learning to find a new way to communicate and listen gives some men the avenue to express themselves that aligns with men s sensibilities and not Feminisms 
MensRights,1616920756, gt Knowing today s society they were probably already acting married By their choice  gt I can t imagine telling my fiance who I ve been with  years  it s your problem not mine  But this is a whole lifetime of being childless not just  years A lifetime of thinking what could be negative back thoughts regrets Seeing others having kids jealousy etc Some men don t want kids Some women don t want kids and some do Why force someone into a lifestyle they never wanted Im not saying the girl in story reacted wrongly she has her own emotions and hardships to deal with But from a outsider perspective  someone completely unrelated to people in the story maybe his timing wasn t best    But overall this was his dream and he knew it wouldn t sit right with him to not have kids If his   future dream isn t a good enough reason to end an engagement then what is  I feel it s very unhealthy to think like that tbh she can find someone who does not want to have biological  kids and be happy And he can find someone who can have bioloigcal kids and be happy  years is worth scarcificing over a lifetime of regrets and sadness 
MensRights,1616920629,Damn  You sound like a feminist caricature of MRAs If we re being technical  there s no point to marriage regardless as you can have children and even cohabitate without it Not having biological children can be a disappointment but I like to think I m more than just my breeding impetus if I weren t then cheating would become an option  I d condemn a woman for leaving a sterile husband and I ll give the same condemnation to a man leaving a barren wife As I said  engagement isn t marriage so I don t condemn   but it s still low 
MensRights,1616920576,Feminists rhetoric regarding men and their emotions equates to  men are broken women and  If they only expressed themselves more they wouldn t have such poor mental health wouldn t have high suicide rates etc  Whilst true that some boys are raised to have stunted emotions many others just don t like being physically or verbally intimate in public if at all Some times there needs to be another way smaller ways to express ourselves rather For the OPs husband this is it The language of love varies Some men are vocal others not Some buy gifts to express their affections and some are physical Others say nothing and aren t physical but they ll show up in the dead of night if you need them because they re loyal This post is here to demonstrate that Feminist rhetoric is wrong that men can and do have our own ways of being emotive IF they re willing to hear us when we express it 
MensRights,1616920543,I m wondering who is responsible for this website because it s absolutely full of  wrong think to the point of absurdity    Women and children must be the only victims of domestic violence or they only help women and children   Screw those men right If you re a man they either don t think it s possible for you to be a victim of domestic violence or they just downright don t want to help you either way there s a big problem here  Do they only help elderly with evictions What about younger people do they not matter Is there something special about  elderly which makes the Ohio bar only help someone who s lived a certain and determined number of years Isn t this ageist Are they assuming older people can t help themselves for some reason  I always tell people  reverse the age gender race and repeat that comment again   How does that sound  If you think it s wrong then it s wrong then it s wrong no matter what way you flip or twist it

MensRights,1616919888,Feminism isn t about men Hence why it s called  feminism  This is because generally women have always been discrimated against in some way It s the same reason racism isn t about white people homaphobia isn t about straight people islamaphobia isn t about Jewish people Putting down men isn t what feminism is but it s also not about solving men s problems when it s a movement about solving women s problems I think some men see it in a completely western sense where they think the mistreatment of women is so small that it s not worth all the fuss But there are still places in the world where women are mutilated forced into marriage and treated like dirt when they have their period Stopping that is what feminism is about 
MensRights,1616919885,You don t have to like the terms alpha and beta We can be more precise There are men who get pussy and respect from other men and there are  men who simp for women follow the leader or make excuses Whether you want to call that alpha vs beta or HVM vs LVM is irrelevant

MensRights,1616916774,Why are the expectations for men  from women primarily  Don t both sides uphold the idea of what a man is supposed to be gt I don t know the theory and data or whatever but those in power are the ones that set the expectations for society right They are the ones that define how we can advance and overcome in society And historically in the West at least the people in power have been men And we all  men and women abide by these standards to be accepted in society or to move up to the top And since these standards  for both men and women have been around for so long there is difficulty in changing them because we are so used to these standards   that s why conservatively minded stubborn people have trouble accepting new ideas because they are so used to what is But the lines are always shifting the further we push certain ideas and call out the need for change      Like u Tori U said everyone has their own definition of feminism Your  egalitarian is what most regular feminists on the street define as  feminist  Feminism is just the more popular movement And again feminism is a very broad and muddy term I do think that Twitter feminists are very man hating and it s weird and unsettling But I do think that it is important to note that some of these man hating feminists may have personal experiences that have made them reach that point Traumatic experiences are traumatic

MensRights,1616916093, gt I don t consider misandry and man hate as feminism I tend to judge a group not by what they say but rather but what they do I also find this excuse very much a  No True Scotsman especially when moderates of feminism allow the radicals to run the show with nary an action and barely a word to stop them It was feminists that protested men s summits to discuss men s issues like mental health and plummeting school performance The nonsense in Toronto comes to mind The only people to condemn it in any reasonable number are MRAs and egalitarians It s feminists that have prevented Great Britain from recognizing men being victims of raoe By their definition in law  men can not be raped by a woman  Feminists have opposed a gender neutral draft every time the issue is raised It s feminists that pushed the asinine Duluth model which by it s very existence is an insult to the idea of equality before the law It is a law enforcement model that always treats the man in a situation as the suspect Nevermind the idiocy of using that in a same sex couple situation it s been used to ignore male victims and enable their abusers   It s feminists that try to not only maintain the absurd double standards in the judicial systems of the world but also to  widen them  It s no secret that  men go to prison women go to therapy  Assuming a woman even gets a sentence she will serve a significantly reduced sentence compared to a male counterpart for identical crimes This is pushed by feminists and I see none of them calling this out in large numbers or in any numbers really They don t care they like this status quo     On top of this their efforts have gone to prevent and shut down men s shelters Male victims have no where to go and often end up homeless or with substance abuse problems   Then you have real winners like Mary Koss who is responsible for trying to bury facts about male victims This isn t some nobody loudmouth she is a influential feminist responsible for leading CDC studies and is part of their think tank She has gone on record saying men and boys can not be raped Here this link is long but I suggest you read the whole thing The guy that wrote it is a much better writer than I   Don t get me wrong there are a handful of feminists still around I can respect Christina Hoff Summers still calls herself a feminist for reasons that are beyond my comprehension since she is basically a pariah now for sticking up for men and rejecting inter sectional feminism as the sectarianism that it is There is a reason she is called  based mom and when she talks she has my undivided attention something I can not say of many others feminist or otherwise  amp  x   B  gt For me feminism is about equality of all sexes and genders  Then you re not a feminist you re an egalitarian A lot of feminists will regurgitate the trite dictionary definition to deflect criticism Specifically  gt Belief in or advocacy of women s social political and economic rights especially with regard to equality of the sexes  The focus is one women and it s done exclusively so So by both definition and deed feminists do not stand for men we are a litmus for feminists to use to measure their own standing against Not even all men either just the most affluent or well off ones This is called Apex Fallacy Where you only use the top examples of something How often do you hear other feminists whining about  lack of women in CEO positions even though to      of men those positions are equally as unattainable Yet you never hear for a big push to put women into equal blue collar positions They exist in these positions but if you walk onto a construction site odds are the woman is a college educated contractor or MBA type not a rank and file worker It s like spotting a rare white elk if they re actually getting down and dirty   gt But everyone sees feminism differently  You re right For instance I see it as an ingrained and institutional power that acts like it s still the underdog fighting  the man or  the establishment or that ever present and all powerful  patriarchy  I see any and all good intentions that was once part of the movement has been warped and shaped into a hammer with which to beat people down Not least of all because of things like this   Read it One of my favorites is the bit about feminists harassing the woman Erin Pizzy that established shelters for women for the crime of going against the narrative established about domestic violence They threatened her stalked her smeared her because she dared suggest that domestic violence is not one sided Or how Canadian Feminists harassed the founder of the ONLY male shelter and had the government run interference in denying him funding until he was driven to suicide These are just drops in the ocean and doesn t even begin to cover how they screw over men in the cases of sexual assault rape and false accusations There s a lot more in this collection of incidents and black marks There s bad apples and extremists in any group sure but they sure seem to be common in feminism and the moderate sit by and only offer  but it s not TRUE feminism because feminism is X Y and Z as a way to make it look like they care In effect it stops nothing and the  extremists get to run the show It s a tidy little arrangement  If this was actually a handful of bad apples I d even agree with you that it s only  some but this is well and beyond  some  Even if numerically the majority of feminists were decent people the policy makers and influential members are complete nutcases more interested in protecting the power they have amassed or keeping revenge based IDPOL going than they are in actual equality I called myself one a long time ago and when I needed them most they hung me out to dry Repeatedly They re not interested in helping men and for all the talk of equality they really don t give a shit about equality if it s not about women Fact is you can t help one reach equality if you ignore or worsen the other 
MensRights,1616935935,Feminism is not and never has been about mens issues  despite what feminists say  It is about womens issues Plain and simple It isn t a bad thing women can have their movement for their interests not my problem The claim that they care about mens issues too however is a flat out lie If any of them ever say this ask them from an example of the movement  not random individuals doing something specifically and exclusively  i e not something that really benefits women and also benefits men by side effect as a group  again not random individuals

MensRights,1616935634,Ok thanks again for your swift and timely reply I truely appreciate this conversation Since we have come to an agreement upon the fact that the high birth rate in Pakistan causes great difficulties for Pakistani society itself as well as for nations that have to absorb the people emigrating from Pakistan to build a future for themselves that Pakistani society is evidently not capable to provide for them can you see acknowledge why those other countries might conduct a feminist foreign policy towards Pakistan I mean feminism for all it flaws has one very reliable effect  It lowers birth rates  Since Pakistan is a nuclear power headed towards severe social disintigration  due to high birth rate and we already have to clean up your demographic spillover for you at great cost for our societies and Pakistan is either unwilling or uncapable to address this issue with necessary urgency  or most likely a bit of both  we apparently need to manage the risk that this Pakistani unwillingness incapability causes for the global community Since Pakistan doesn t care about the negative effects it has on the interantional community why should we care about your cultural sensibilities while mitigating those negative effects As Morpheus said in the Matrix I m offering you the truth Nothing more Sorry if this comes across as offensive I don t mean to offend If one has to break through a layer of ignorance a certain amount of rethorical force is sometimes necessary I m genuinely interested in your thoughts opinion on this situation whatever they may be Looking forward to your reply

MensRights,1616935270,EXACTLY bro at some point I said I don t want to bother with that shit anymore  The issue is the same that I already mentioned a few radicals destroy the reputation of the group Incels are woman hating virgins Feminists are men hating screeching idiots Antifa are violent facists BLM are city destroying terrorists
MensRights,1616935268,Look  western society more or less revolves around convenience Since accepting that you are obese goes out of your comfort zone the best way to counter is to not talk about it or simply glamorize it It s more of a culture of convenience than accepting the harsh truth that you are obese 
MensRights,1616935192,Nah she had nothing black and white words it is sexism because mandatory for men not women But in new leftist terms sexism is when you have more men doing something than women even if it s a forced action most women wouldn t accept anyways 
MensRights,1616935168,You know I ve had some conversations with people from or originally from outside the US and Europe Many of them say that actually following the same logic of feminists men are  oppressed or at the very least have less rights  as weird as that my seem initially  and I am starting to agree with them to some extent Not saying all men and women are the same just in general Keep in mind this is context country dependant For example  briefly  women really have a higher degree of control in relationships and in families  even though they don t look it or act like it is not the case  They are entitled to their man s income but not the other way around Generally speaking for marriage the male has to have his shit together while the female has to just accept Some women say  I m just as girl and get away with a lot of shit where males are expected to  man up  The list goes on but I hope you got the point 
MensRights,1616934930,I dont understand the hatred for incels  maybe I misunderstood but from what I gather an incel is someone who doesn t wanna deal with shit anymore they have been rejected so many times and often times in disgusting ways that they are so hurt and tired they just don t care anymore    in movies if you saw that guy and fucked with him you would be the bad guy people in the audience would say  ugh what kinda dick character picking on the sad man but in real life you are cool to laugh at sad people That seems fucked up to me

MensRights,1616933776,We re not at that point yet over here But there are a few similar recent instances and all the stuff going in on the internet and in some places in he world regarding males just being inherently bad and a threat to women The sad thing is some men are jumping on the bandwagon 
MensRights,1616933732,Less than half of the females in Pakistan are literate whereas   percent of men are literate Many sources suggest the overall illiteracy rates in Pakistan are increasing despite a global decrease overall  One of the ways feminism has made real change in societies is by vastly improving education for women Do you feel this is an initiative that lacked foresight or are you supportive of improving access to education for young women in Pakistan that are clearly lagging behind their male peers 
MensRights,1616933593,Yes I am aware of that I think I heard something like this from someone from the USA too where big companies prefer hiring Mexicans because they will agree to work on really low wages  I forgot what I read exactly but I think it was something similar to that  I think because of situations like these actual citizens don t get many job opportunities even in low wage sectors

MensRights,1616933441,Oh so you are one of those who says that  feminism is about equality lol It s just not You don t know why I am pissed over feminism No it s not just because  some feminists seems to want to overpower men it s not that simple You are doing a strawman Where did I said that the problem was solely on the fact that this account was only for women  Because I didn t In fact it s not even a problem in itself it s a symptom If there s no TwitterMen account it s because Twitter as a company is just following trends this account is just for PR If they didn t made a TwitterMen account it s because they know they would receive a lot of backlash and they don t want to face it Hence why people are angry at that It s just showing how men are perceived in society we can t have support Fighting  for equality for women  Don t you think it doesn t make any sense lmao Equality is between  things at minimum but you purposefully said  equality for women  why not  equality between women and men  I know that there are aspects where men are more in power and vice versa and I absolutely agree I m an egalitarian I thrive for equality for all humans but you don t even ask yourself why I m that mad over feminism  well you don t because you made up some reasons  why would feminism have the exclusivity of  equality anyway  The thing that convinced me that feminism is absolutely not about equality is this scene in The Red Pill   I considered myself a feminist when I first saw this movie but to me it wasn t making sense that those people were protesting at some men talking about the issues they were facing and calling them names There s even a woman saying that she would like to have both men and women talking about their issues yet she s protesting against them    So maybe you are being honest you really think feminism is about equality and all but it s really not You can t be about equality when you shutdown any people who wants to speak about problems you don t get You have to at least let them speak understand what they are talking about and then get angry if there s something to be angry about but just shutting down people before or when they speak just shows that you are afraid of what they might say If you are honest if you really thrive for equality in society please dig deeper into the subject give more attention to problems men are facing at least as much as women s and you will reach the same conclusion as me  feminism ain t about equality just be an egalitarian Btw the point your made about the tirade isn t pertinent I was talking about the content  yk the things I wrote between

MensRights,1616932471, gt Most women follow it not because of oppression or anything but because they respect their religion No offence but I really don t believe this to be the case They follow it in fear of oppression from their husbands their father and just society s etc in general Can you really tell me with utmost certainty that they wouldn t be heavily looked down upon and even beaten of they don t follow these things of their own will

MensRights,1616932190,Thanks for your swift and detailed reply May I ask how common polygamous marriages  one men several wifes are in Pakistan as per your experience impression I d suppose that this would further aggravate the situation of young men who not only have bad economic prospects  due to high birth rates but also are further challenged to find a wife because more economicly successful men take several wifes and thus reduce the number of women available for marriage

MensRights,1616931441, gt I know this isn t really a men s rights issue This is about as core a men s issue as it gets That being said this place is not exactly ideal for working on such sensitive issues Due to the hands off moderation policy it can be a bit crude and combative at times and psychological expertise  which is what you need I think is pretty rare around here There s a community that might be of better help than this forum   This was founded by two psychologists who are quite critical of the feminist bent that psychology has taken in the recent decades Therefore they built this community for men to share their problems and be communal and helping each other Also Tom Golden  who is a psychotherapist who specializes in men s issues and is a co founder of the aforementioned community has a website where you can contact him   I think these spaces might be better suited at providing you with what you re looking for both in terms of psychological expertise to inform your support for your son as well as with respect to giving you a support group of guys and dads to discuss your issues I can t promise you anything but I hope it helps 
MensRights,1616931421,Let me guess you re very young There s no way you can believe women don t have problems of their own I suppose you also think racism isn t real or it affects white people worse Women are    of rape victims and that s only the reported ones They have to be far more wary than men while walking home at night because of this They re also the majority of domestic abuse victims Women are under more pressure to look nice get laughed if they don t and get gawked at and potentially groped in the street if they do Their natural physical inferiority to men leaves them far more vulnerable to violence Women experience general sexism all the time just look at in video game chats when someone hears a female voice or when a YouTube comment has a woman in their profile picture That s a problem ingrained in society Talking about suicides homelessness and homicides are massive issues but they only affect a small percentage of the male population The majority of the things I listed affect almost all women Maybe it s best to realise that every group has issues no matter how privileged you perceive them to be

MensRights,1616931156,Unlike in western countries our culture is completely opposite and also extremely conservative As it is a Muslim country we have a lot of restrictions and strictly follow them Some of the examples are   In western countries it is believed that women should wear whatever they want But in Muslim countries like mine women are supposed to cover their bodies Most women follow it not because of oppression or anything but because they respect their religion   Same with sex Sex before marriage is forbidden and most men and women will strictly follow it too So it will be extremely rare to find pregnancy in women before marriage So you wouldn t find anything promotions like birth control or stuff like that What I gathered from western countries about  My body my choice is that it is usually based on these two things So promoting something like that here would be pointless Sure this type of thinking might be good in western countries where premarital sex is common and all that stuff But promoting something where they don t have this type of culture is pointless in my opinion

MensRights,1616930341,Yeah I m not going to have an argument around libertarianism We can agree to disagree but I think paternity leave is one way to move the cultural needle around certain issues that people on this sub bemoan like men not being taken as seriously as parents

MensRights,1616930138,It s true She isn t very pretty and I m someone who finds its really messed up that pretty women seem to not be subjected to actual justice I know I m a woman who is lurks here and I do for a reason My boyfriend has a son he s nine now Greatest little man you d ever meet I don t have any kids but he is amazing I ve known him for years now greatest little man I ve ever met I m one of his parents he calls me one of his moms I never thought I could love someone else s son as much as I love this little man I don t want to sound like trying to be tough person on internet but I would have thoughts of murdering this woman if she ever did this to  Greyson And that s where it is even more messed up This type of material is so rarely seen on reddit or other social media Why is this type of thing so secluded to places like this sub and other unknown places of news It bothers me even more that it is not only a possibility that he could have this happen to him  beyond terrible on its own but it would be baried to the point you have to dig for it and even then it s somehow a fucking debate based on the dumb bitches looks or if the child wanted it etc Fucking sick world we live in 
MensRights,1616929974,I think something similar happened I can t confirm the source because I ve only heard from multiple people here but I think some kind of NGO hired those women from another country At least that s what I heard I can agree with them because their Urdu  our native language was not even that good They were trying to promote things that Pakistani women had for decades now For example rights to vote owning property and cars having high rankings in offices etc Women can literally do whatever men can do in Pakistan If you spend even a few minutes googling that you can find all these things Pakistan is mainly a Muslim country The women who wear a burka  headscarf don t do it because they are pressed they do it because it s part of their religion These feminists were trying to promote the  My body my choice agenda here too It was hated by most women here not just men Women were even making fun of that statement lol That s why I think the women who were trying to promote feminism didn t do any research regardless of where they were from

MensRights,1616929694,I m not very informed on Pakistan to be honest Only thing I know is that you have a pretty high birth rate    births      inhabitants as per UN data  and in combination with rising live expectancy that creates a very young population which brings predictable problems with respect to social stability If there are a lot of young people in a country they want need economic opportunities to make a living for themselves  and their future families  It has often been observed that the economies of countries with very high birth rates can t keep up with the population growth which leads to wage stagnation or even wage decrease for everyone due to an oversupply of workers This in turn leads to many young people not having good prospects for the future which leads to economic and social unrest Would be genuinely interested in your perspective on this 
MensRights,1616929351,Ok I understand that better I was looking at Tori U specifically and I m happy that she cares about the males in her life  So I think it s because in the broader picture feminism has turned more into an anti male concept that normalize male hate language So someone who supports feminism is unable to simultaneously support men s rights unless they are willing to criticize and fight against what is currently happening with feminism

MensRights,1616929145, gt The summary of this post is that they don t research the culture of a certain country they just want to promote their agenda no matter where in the world they are In my experience it s not really actual feminists that do this and rather menhaters on platforms like Twitter that use the movement as a guide to further their own bullshit propaganda It s ridiculous

MensRights,1616947455,Hi I m also an egalitarian    A good post which highlights criticism of feminist actions can be found on  r LeftWingMaleAdvocates      Am I ashamed to be in the  MRA movement  Definitely not I mostly don t call myself a MRA because gendered labels tend to create tribalism Sometimes I may call myself feminist or MRA if I think it helps the discussion either by using the same label as the person I m talking to or an unexpected label On twitter I discuss and share my views and advocate for men under my real name so even that isn t an issue  but there is less  cancel culture issues for employee in europe because of laws protecting workers  The reason I m more critical of feminism is because it holds power There are bad MRAs but they don t have any power Government agencies push misleading statistics about domestic violence wage gap and others create sexist laws and sexist international conventions all of this due to the influence of feminism

MensRights,1616946870, Is that Twitter handle off limits or can someone actually use it 
MensRights,1616946486,Out of curiosity did you  really expect the statistics to be the reverse I m really bemused that so many on here appear surprised that suicide figures in countries such as the UK and Canada exceed homicide figures How many people do you know who have committed   attempted to commit suicide or knows someone who has committed attempted to commit suicide How many do you know who has been the victim of murder attempted murder I know of a fair few across a number of social groups It s not uncommon to know someone who has committed suicide but it is extremely rare to know someone who was murdered I genuinely don t see why you guys are surprised by this stat And considering the sub this is  this makes it even more bemusing I think even on the feminism sub this wouldn t be something novel or offer new insight it s kinda stating the obvious And yet this is a men s rights sub and you are all so surprised by this It s really bizarre to compare figures of suicide versus figures of homicide I mean more women die of cancer than murder so what Dying of a mental or physical illness should not be compared with being murdered it s wholly irrational 
MensRights,1616946127,You can definitely train your mind if you re aware of this bias though Problem is that it s taboo to talk about this subject and everyone who tries to do so is met with scrutiny by both genders  My advice would be offer the men in your life the same favors and kindness you would offer a woman When a man is talking about his pain bear in mind that you might actually be the only person who is willing to hear When a man is talking about his problems don t try to gaslight him and blame him for all of his problems because yes guys do that all the time with one another when a woman talks about her problems it s society s fault for sucking never her own But as soon as a man talks other people will say his problems are all on his mind that it s mostly insecurity etc 
MensRights,1616945888,I wasn t trying to say it s wrong to have preferences I was just talking about the type of guys that go out of their way to say how much their gfs are superior to other girls just for having big boobs or big ass I for one am indifferent when it comes to the ladies doesn t matter if they have Bs or D s I just prefer a natural look to a woman If my idea of a perfect woman expects to bend over backwards every single just because she knows she s a perfect   just doesn t seem worth it to me If you have to worry about buying expensive diamonds every single month just to keep her attention just doesn t feel like love to me

MensRights,1616945376,Actually debate is about tearing down the other sides argument That s why politicians do debate They are not interested in finding which party has the best arguments they are about winning people over to their side using manipulation if necessary    gt The   dialectical  method is dialogue between two or more people holding  different points of view about a subject who wish to establish the  truth of the matter by dialogue with reasoned arguments   Dialectics is  different from debate   wherein the debaters are  committed to their  points of view and mean to    win    the debate  either by persuading the  opponent proving their argument correct or proving the opponent s  argument incorrect  thus either a judge or a jury must decide who wins  the debate The healthy variant where people seek truth is called a dialogue I also just learned the meaning of debate a few years ago 
MensRights,1616945358,did the woman get charged with something or is she seeking out another victim 
MensRights,1616944887,Just like  Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo   The Prosecution originally believed she had been  manipulated by him to help commit the murders so they cut a deal for her to testify  Then the video eveidence surfaced and they realized she was a willing participant  She   got   years 
MensRights,1616944886,Gynocentrism is simply hardwired in human DNA It s impossible in to  fix it within a generation or two unless you go around producing genetically modified humans  The only thing you can do is educate people about this but as soon as you try that you ll be branded as misogynist incel and thrown in jail I guess the best approach is educating young boys about this from an early age 
MensRights,1616944845,We are fighting for gender equality too   Gender equality is not  off topic    It is the core essence of MRA  This was supposed to be the job of  gender equality movement when it first started But they neglected men s rights That s why we fight for it

MensRights,1616943810,Yes you are right No offense taken Due to the unwillingness and incapability of the government people go to the countries where they can find opportunities without knowing what it could do to that country as you mentioned The government here is really corrupt who don t take care of people at all and only care about money About the cultural sensibility you don t have to care at all But in my opinion it can help your cause a lot For example there are multiple NGOs and some feminist organizations that help people a lot But they understand what Pakistan lacks that s why they are successful in their cause But I think you re comparing a really big problem  the effect of your economy due to immigrants with a really minor one  lacking the cultural knowledge  I think that s why you think cultural sensibility is a minor problem to care about which is true But as I mentioned above having some knowledge about culture can help your cause a lot 
MensRights,1616943783,Thank you for correcting me I ve heard similar things too It is true that a lot of mothers scare their daughters like this but a lot of women do it out of respect for the religion too In my opinion mothers shouldn t scare their daughters like that and yes you re right it can be creepy too I appreciate you sharing your perspective too 
MensRights,1616943614,Even if she served about   years that s still a long ass time There s a lot you miss out on in that span of time and that can still really fuck your life up 
MensRights,1616943535,Men forced to do something against their will women allowed to make the choice for themselves Not sexism Men and women each given a choice in what they want to do and more men choose to do something than women Sexism Modern gender politics sure are fun I ll never get over how misogynistic feminists can be They see fewer women in STEM so they push for more advantages for women So now we have all manner of female only scholarships to push more women into STEM and women get crazy advantages in the hiring process due to everyone racing to fill gender quotas But even so there are  still fewer women in STEM To a rational person the obvious explanation is that women simply don t want to work in STEM fields as much as men do But feminists absolutely  must blame everything on misogyny so they continue to conclude that fewer women in STEM means misogyny The irony here is that by concluding that they are denying that women are simply using their choice So feminists are denying that women have free will and agency Pretty misogynistic don t you think 
MensRights,1616943315,To add onto what the other guy said a large part of the problem is that  incel has joined  nazi   fascist  and  racist in the camp of words which don t mean anything anymore They ve been overused Anyone who disagrees with a black person on anything gets called racist Anyone who disagrees with a leftist on anything gets called a fascist nazi And people get called incel for   basically anything So it kind of means nothing anymore The other guy was right about the original definition And you are right that with the original definition it would be ridiculous to hate such a group It would essentially be virgin shaming But the problem is like the other guy said a loud minority have become twisted and hateful leading to  incel becoming an attack word And once it became an attack word it started to lose meaning because you can just throw an opinion out and if people disagree they might call you an incel despite that having nothing to do with your sex life 
MensRights,1616943183,Hey so as a Pakistani woman I think your first point is somewhat wrong Yes a lot of women do wear hijab by choice but there are a lot of women who are told from a young age as well how women who don t cover up and wear shirts pants casual attire mostly are sluts or attention seekers Some women are told to cover up even in their own house around cousins and in some cases family even like It s seriously creepy being told that you need to cover up in your own house around a   year old something married man who s your relative When I was around   I had short hair which I kept untied no Biggie right  My mom would disagree she loved to tell me how it looks weird and cheap and only  cheap western women do it yeah also how I d burn in hell for it By the way She s educated used to teach and comes from a good family so this isn t a case of my family in particular being like this because of lack of education 
MensRights,1616943068,You are conflating two things when you say  feminism here When the other person says feminism is rooted in hate he s talking about the ideology the underlying theories as well as the changes accomplished by mainstream feminism But you are shifting to treating  feminism as if the definition is  the collection of all people who label themselves feminists  which is a fairly useless definition I agree with you that many people who label themselves feminists truly believe in equality But the issue is that them labeling themselves feminists is kind of useless It s just a word in that context But when discussion the problems of feminism itself we aren t referring to  everyone who self labels as a feminist  we are referring to the ideology of feminism

MensRights,1616942834,I wouldn t even agree with that Anyone is allowed to have their own standards It s how you behave which becomes a problem If you only want to date women with big tits go for it You re limiting yourself and you are taking a risk that you might end up alone because you are removing so many potential partners from the pool But that doesn t make you a douchebag Now if you are treating women with smaller boobs like shit because of that Douchebag If you are body shaming the concept of smaller boobs Douchebag The way you behave can make you a douchebag But simply setting a standard for yourself that you only really want to date someone with big tits Not douchebag 
MensRights,1616942649,Advertisers take twitter seriously have you seen the state of youtube lately Lol
MensRights,1616942596,Agreed all around Much of the time the  if it were a man argument just feels baseless and paranoid Sorry to bring up other political topics but it feels the same as when people  insist that if January  th had been carried out by black people they d all be dead It s based on nothing but conjecture and that conjecture is based on the idea in people s heads that racism is far worse than it actually is There s no evidence that if they had been black they d all be dead But because people have convinced themselves that racism is so rampant they believe that s the case And that argument is toxic because it just feeds into it even more convincing even more people of something which might not even be true It s important to avoid that I do believe that men get a raw deal in the criminal justice system But it s important not to continually fan the flames back and forth by throwing out baseless assumptions that if a woman had been a man she d be treated worse All that does is make us all more mad about something which is likely true but might not be It s just a dangerous pattern So I agree with you 
MensRights,1616942591,I just stay away from the politics nobody takes political stuff on Twitter seriously

MensRights,1616940908,I don t understand your title You re talking about those people who say men should deal with their own problems and leave feminism to women but complain when we try to do so If so I agree  The thing is they re not opposed to men talking about their issue AS LONG as you do so in the way they want which won t achieve shit You re allowed to talk about your problems but you gotta adhere to their terms  patriarchy toxic masculinity  you gotta respect their oppression privilege ladder  men as the class who holds the power and women as victims and you re never never allowed to use generalizations the way they do That s pretty much places like the menslib sub where feminists control the discussion That s actually a very common trait of dictatorships by the way A controlled opposition places where people with dissenting opinions can share their views and concerns but only to a certain extent and only with the approval of their overlords 
MensRights,1616940510,Whilst I agree there are definite biological traits in men and women that should be respected they do not completely define us in the same way that our brains have evolved to moderate our basic impulses with reason so that our impulses no longer completely control us Human beings are remarkably plastic in adapting to new situations if there is just cause There is certainly merit in getting back on track with honouring our biological traits instead of allowing feminist fads to direct our evolution into self serving directions however reason should be the guiding factor in how we moderate those biological traits We also need to consider that there is indeed diversity in human beings homosexuality is a reality that blends some female traits with male traits so we can t insist on essentially male individuals being forced or encouraged to behave totally like a stereotypical heterosexual man That was attempted in forcing homosexual men to become heterosexual men and it not only failed it damaged those it tried to cure I believe there is greater diversity than we realise so it is not appropriate to try to mold every male into a traditional man I can accept that some men are confused by the constant barrage to be more like women but there will be others who do actually have some female traits who would benefit from having them accepted The difficulty is in discerning what traits are so intimately linked to our biology that they are essentially immutable and should not ever be attempted to be changed and which traits are more to do with unreasoning tradition and can be improved I think your innate desire of men to protect and provide is actually raw sex drive evolved with reason that protecting and providing for a woman is optimal in having readier access to sex plus it has symmetry with a woman wanting to protect and provide for a child which she can t do alone it s effectively an exchange that is reasonably well balanced I believe we have evolved further from that point but in a direction that has women now wanting everything including control over sex without giving anything in return to maintain the balance Furthermore in order to achieve this I believe women want to convert men into women with penises and that attempt at conversion is what we are seeing reflected in the confusion of young men because it goes against their most fundamental trait of their pursuit of sex which they feel but are told it should not exist for the comfort of women I had always understood that a man s fundamental drive was to spread his seed widely and perhaps that was how it was at the start until maybe he reasoned that a stable relationship with a single woman provided more sex than trying to obtain it with many reluctant women Thus I would say that some traits can evolve where they offer the potential for improvement but there will always be the immutable drive for sex underlying it all  and maybe some others I haven t addressed  Unfortunately evolution is not heading in the direction of improvements for men but the converse of  improvements for women at the expense of men I also don t agree with walking a path alone the indigenous Australian men s corroborees etc reflect a history of men s groups to guide a man s development It s only modern society that has largely abandoned guidance for its young and replaced it by permissiveness  to go it alone by trial and error which is confusing to young people who need direction The tendency for men to go it alone stems I think from the competitive spirit being encouraged rather than the cooperative spirit Competition leads to division and is a good match for the capitalist system but it ultimately is not a good outcome for a society that relies on its cohesion from cooperation and I think why society is crumbling As an exercise perhaps we should try identifying fundamental biological traits and others that are more socially influenced

MensRights,1616935987,That is what the left does man  We have to be sexist to stop sexism We have to be racist to stop racism We have to be fascist to stop fascism We have to be Naz     ect They don t care about hypocrisy it doesn t affect them Power is the name of the game for leftists Ironically if you read Harry Potter the modern left has much in common with the death eaters Their methods are almost perfectly aligned From the controlling of the press the character assassination of their opponents to their willingness to use fear and violence to control the  wizarding world

MensRights,1616953885, gt Some women are told to cover up even in their own house around cousins and in some cases family even like It s seriously creepy being told that you need to cover up in your own house around a   year old something married man who s your relative I am a guy living in a third world country and believe it or not but me and my male cousins were told to cover up ourselves in our own houses as well For the most part that meant no shorts  I always thought about this it as a matter of basic decency and respect I think some women just blow this topic out of proportion  
MensRights,1616953864,The word  feminism itself sounds sexist to me I mean how could that word mean  equality to all genders  It sounds more like a racist cult or something 
MensRights,1616953781,Ok I see I indeed misunderstood misinterpreted your position from your original initial post My sinciere apoligies for this shortcoming on my side The problem with the culturally sensitive approach is that it is slow And in the case of Pakistan in my humble opinion it is too slow It brings about the long lasting trans generational change that is needed but in the case of Pakistan there is simply not enough time for this approach alone to resolve the situation  Here   you can see a video  maybe you have already seen it from your neighbour to the west Very different country culture political system for sure but it shows what the  not so culturally sensitive approach can provide Fast change in the face of entrenched couter productive cultural norms So maybe see it like this The culturally unsensitive approach is not meant to be liked or to appeal that was neither its aim nor its purpose In the metaphor of   the carrot and the stick    it is clearly playing the role of the stick Since Islam allows the husband to beat the wife  as a meassure of last resort with a stick provided that the stick is no thicker than his thumb consider the culturally insensitive approach to be the stick with which the women s movement can  beat back uncooperative men institutions Where previously the  culturally sensitive approach might have been considered the  extreme position it is now the  middle of the road position So maybe this perspective helps in understanding the overall strategy better In case you don t already know him and are interested in understanding the links between cultural norms demographics economy and the wealth and welbing of a society more deeply I can not recommend  Hans Rosling   enough  This video   of his quite fascinating and shows how seemingly irrelevant details have the greatest impact

MensRights,1616953540,I hope to see the day when we really do see sexual orientation as nothing more than a personal preference that anyone can choose albeit a bit more of a permanent preference
MensRights,1616953504,What you are saying is absolutely true but men brains are programmed to be stimulated visually For example when advertisements are targeted towards men you ll see things like female feet next to a bear can female hands holding the product hair next that gillet shaving razor to show women approval So why wear tight shorts all these revealing pieces of cloth when married engaged serious committed relationship The only way to interpret this is that females want to keep their options open or seeking external validation 
MensRights,1616953504, gt Does that actually happen in your country The most sickening aspect of this story is most parents supported that hate session of an assembly 
MensRights,1616953446,Congrats on having one of the best takes on this sub

MensRights,1616952889,Perhaps you should try seeing nuance I have spoken quite clearly that the word rape needs to be reserved for when someone s desire NOT to have sex is contravened I do support sex with minors being illegal but forcing ones self on a   year old is a hell of a lot worse than accepting a teenager s advances  Save the phrase  rape of a minor for when a minor who did NOT want to have sex was forced to 
MensRights,1616952850,Women are resilient and yet can t walk home at night for fear of being raped murdered 
MensRights,1616952838,Nah no one brigaded me personally this round but since I ve received multiple rape and death threats in my dms over the months from the men that frequent this sub because I gave my input on other posts in different subreddits I m sure some came from here It happens I never said it all came from here obviously   Peace be with you   
MensRights,1616952769,When have I said most men are like that Quote me I ll wait 
MensRights,1616952521,I think a lot of people don t know this but females check out other people too Personally I think the only difference when I check out females and males in public and when men check me out is the amount of comfort they re in I mean I check people out but I don t make them feel unsafe violated shamed nor harassed 
MensRights,1616952455,I don t understand what stance you re defending but you seem to be minimizing statutory rape  Middle school children  boys and girls aren t capable of sexual consent especially when it comes to sex with adults  Perhaps sex between two minors should be investigated as not necessarily being rape but once you get an adult involved they have such a greater responsibility of reason and restraint that it doesn t matter if the kid  wanted it  it s rape and manipulation  You could feed a child ice cream until they ended up in the hospital the child  wanting the ice cream doesn t excuse the negligence of the adult

MensRights,1616951790,While saying things like that I m pretty sure you won t get a good response most of the time 
MensRights,1616951767,It s closest to  radical feminism that advocates separation from and domination over men They are anti trans anti sex worker anti pornography generally sex negative  because all of those things erode the bargaining power that women hold as sexual gatekeepers in our society Radical Feminists also advocated withholding sex from men as a way to gain power over them even going so far as to become  political lesbians  FDS exemplifies this angry power hungry transactional shrew philosophy    Feminism in general has definitely gone off the rails lately but FDS exemplifies one of the worst variants of it 
MensRights,1616951713,They change wording all the time  Retard used to be just a medical scientific term Now we can t even use it that way because people are so retarded 
MensRights,1616951685,I ve watched videos about it too It s so sad and yes it looked similar to the feminists in western countries 
MensRights,1616951631,That Twitter is promoting feminism and will certainly not allow for a similar official forum for the issues that their male staff have 
MensRights,1616951541,Only  feminist men who ll follow the program  It s clearly about promoting women and so called  women s issues and showing how  with the program Twitter is

MensRights,1616951473, Might   No This is a new trend where homosexuality is accepted but its not religiously accepted Our main scholars all have said it was a sin backed by Ayahs of the Quran Abu Hanifa was born only a few years after Muhammed SAW passing They lived and were surrounded with Islamic culture and knowledge and even met people who have met Muhammed SAW and spent their lives memorising and learning the deen     years later I dont think we got a better understanding and more knowledge of the deen then they did to change aspects of it

MensRights,1616950476,I wouldn t be surprised if they are saying it is sexist against women that more suicide victims are men

MensRights,1616949532,Exactly if you rape a child then you should never have the right to move freely ever again in case you seek out more victims 
MensRights,1616949499, gt how does the feminist movement influence the government so greatly I think they are just very good at lobbying   and lying I ve come to the conclusion that whenever you see a statistic pushed by feminists you can bet what they say is false But people don t have the knowledge and time to find the source and check if what is said is correct When I put a link to a    page study on wage differences on twitter people tend to not want to read it Also both conservatives and  progressives are very happy to favor women and dismiss men in issues of parenting and violence  they are both very traditionalist in that regard They only differ on some points like abortion  gt    of state legislatures are woman      of state senate seats     state house or assembly seats  There is also the question of how many women are member of a party I think it s about     at least in Germany  How do you vote for women when they are not even there to get elected And then you read this  gt You re not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female  member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote meaning the quorum  could not be met and the bill died then and there  source     So basically feminists avoided shared parenting which would have equalized parenting duties which would in turn have given more time for mothers to get involved in politics I honestly hope that this sexist politic won t be the politic they support when there are more women in politics Because it turns out men are still voting for laws favoring women influenced by the feminist narrative Women are quite well represented by men because men tend to favor women On the other hand there are female MRAs and they do quite a good job So the big issue isn t men women involved in politics The issue is sexist people  which includes feminists  representing us 
MensRights,1616949257,I still think you are missing the point  The tweet or whatever is saying that if something as  innocent as showing shoulders by a girl is a distracting in school then the logical conclusion should follow that men shouldn t be able to drive either  Since that s a silly idea it also shines a light on the inherent silliness of the shoulder position  This  petition is actually on the side of men not against them as you seem to suggest 
MensRights,1616949107,Agreed even if not death at least life in prison especially the girl who raped  kids but thanks too a plea deal it was if the  children scarred for life didn t exist as if they meant nothing and only the one victim actually meant anything 
MensRights,1616949070, gt Nope I understand female bigotry perfectly  gt I m assuming you re a virgin considering your personality and clear hatred of men I didn t say you were a virgin did I Not all men only the ones who expresses explicit hatred towards women such as yourself But even then I wouldn t say it is a hatred just a mild disdain 
MensRights,1616949065,No women can rape other women it s not when the perpetrator has a penis They ll call it rape when a female teacher rapes a girl But the second the  victim has a penis it magically becomes something else

MensRights,1616948888,Look to the case of Brian Banks if you want to know why 
MensRights,1616948859,She said they are both in the same stand point emotionally but physical damage may of been caused to the girl thus giving grounds for a higher sentencing She isn t saying that it s worse when a girl is raped she is just giving a potential reason for the sentence difference 
MensRights,1616948857,Either way both monsters deserve death in my opinion I don t think either one deserves  a break  I personally would kill both if given the green light 
MensRights,1616948724,Why is this not a big news all over the world Why are such crazy shits not getting enough coverage 
MensRights,1616948689,That is a fair point if there was physical damage to the girl than you are probably right on why the sentence was higher and we don t know if there was I guess in every situation there is bound to be variables 
MensRights,1616948507,I just looked at the website what is sexist Maybe I am looking at the wrong page Looks all gender neutral to me 
MensRights,1616948460,Yes he was referring to the conviction rate Conviction rate cannot be even used as an argument against a party It s a shortcoming of the justice system He says lower conviction rate means men are benefitting from it Which means he assumes men to be the wrongdoers in all cases by default 
MensRights,1616948366,I ll point out that tearing down an argument and tearing down a person are not the same thing But thank you for a well supported rebuttal 
MensRights,1616948294,Yes for him such cases are ought to be ignored as they are very small in number according to him 
MensRights,1616948209,Yes definitely emotionally neither child can deal with this appropriately Thankfully I don t think a  year old can produce sperm 
MensRights,1616948194,Ah I ll check that out I m really super to ideas if they re either backed by some sort of data or an otherwise a logically backed up claim  I too tend to avoid labels  My idea is that women do lack some rights as do men So can one be a true member of both MRA and FRA Both parties have different defecits and nobody really has the complete upperhand  With the government thing that must be true to some degree I ve been learning about more and more unbiased studies  amp reports esp about assault an such that show men are often abused and assaulted as well However looking at other objective data there are deficits for women    of state legislatures are woman      of state senate seats     state house or assembly seats Harris is the first F vice president and there still hasn t been a F pres  in your  valued and respected opinion how does the feminist movement influence the government so greatly 
MensRights,1616948154,Thanks for your answer I brought up this point to him He says such instances are negligible compared to the atrocities women face from men So it can be ignored 
MensRights,1616948098,And emotionally the little boy night not be able to have sex And financially he may be indebted to child support for   year
MensRights,1616948010,The thing is tho is that men don t all have the same preference some like curvier women some like more petite women some like both the same or are indifferent Some women don t mind a smaller dick but they have to talk like they are putting up with it I ve seen a video with this one couple who are very attracted to each other and their sex is very natural but when she talks to the viewer she says something along the lines of it s ok even if he doesn t have more than  inches he s still a good lover

MensRights,1616958533,Don t pay it any mind my friend Well what I actually mean is don t let this sink in any more than being just a glancing blow on your psyche Yeah speak up against it and inform people how you feel about it but know it s just typical misandry nonsense

MensRights,1616957674,So let s talk this out It is a constitutional right to sex despite age or gender or consent Are you sure you that s the direction to go Man if rape culture was actually real we would have just hit the lottery 
MensRights,1616957491,what do people even mean when they say  emotionally fulfill I was never more than an ATM to a lot of these women to begin with and they say I m the under developed one lol 
MensRights,1616957453,I m in favor of mens rights but isnt it different for women The woman has everything to loose in the relationship the power dynamic is in the boys favor eventhough he is young

MensRights,1616957327,The truth is it is really different Men brain interpret visual things in a way completely different especially skin And if you disagree you can read this journal   The visuals in commercials are only to attract men attention and not to disregard the quality of a product and you mentioning it in that way shows that you are here to disagree instead of understanding the purpose of the example i have given  Saying that this is toxic isn t really valid asking men to be okay with other psychopaths and people stare in an uncomfortable way checking their partners definitely is Skin isn t something anyone should show in public In private with their partner is the correct place for wearing whatever Clothes are designed in a way that highlights women curves boobs and asses  I don t understand how this hard to understand and apply in reality
MensRights,1616957123,Personally I believe that there s nothing much difference between a man and a woman besides their capacity to have sperm and egg cells  For all the times I got sexually harassed I remind myself that there were guys in my life who didn t made me feel unsafe People who gets swayed easily is what we call gullible Gullible people are good for the business I honestly believe that men are deep thinkers too I get irritated when people generalize men with the similar words like the ones you just said  men brains are programmed to be stimulated visually because for someone to be easily swayed one must not have deep values and life principles  in other words shallow  Commitment goes deep as living with someone s good life principles There are old couples who lasted the relationship for more than   years and married men aren t always stimulated visually by their wives they have long lasting relationship because they live by their life principles and deep values That s what commitment is about understanding that we are going to embody each other s deep values and life principles and nothing about it feels forced  I m sorry for the lengthy reply I just don t think that all men are shallow as how you described  men brains to be 
MensRights,1616957116,I don t think we need radical groups like BLM Pakistan has a history of far right groups and also a few far left groups What Pakistan need is a steady progress in investment in health care education and the economy There is no need for radical movements Pakistan is a country that has to go forward with taking into accounts other large ethnic groups within Pakistan who all have their own history and cultures It would be unwise to impose western backed movements that want to forcibly change its culture

MensRights,1616956692,The problem is not primarily one of genetics but of gestation and the duration of child reering  which is of course ultimately determined by genetics in sofar you re correct  The role contribution of the man can be substituted  sperm banks sex toys and or split up and socialized  welfare state provides police protects      The role of the woman can not There is no artificial womb that allows a man to reproduce indepently without the explicit contribution from an individual women This power imbalance is in my humble opinion the heart of the issue

MensRights,1616956248,  gt Whoosh right over your head  gt The reason this is important is that feminists adhere to the lie that men are dangerous and that women are justified in being afraid of men because men pose a significant danger to women  which is clearly not the case  They frame the argument as being one of safety for women but their disinterest in suicide as an issue underlines the fact that feminists in fact don t care about women s safety since suicide is a far graver threat to women Their concern about  femmicide is about spreading fear and hatred against men It s not about women s safety Why is it that everytime I queried something with one of you you can t help but respond with condescension or passive aggression Do you not know how to debate with reason and rationality Or are you just so angry at us females you can t control your emotions so cross  The point I m making is that you are pointing out the   blindingly obvious  as if it is some light bulb moment when common sense should have told you that anyway  Feminists have never argued that men kill women more than women kill themselves They d argue that more men commit violent acts against women than do woman for sure It is far more reasonable to compare genders in homicide rates than bringing suicide into the equation  The only people who seem to be surprised by this common sense information are you  men s rights activists not feminists so what exactly have you achieved Other than to perhaps to feel more validated in your beliefs and cogntivie distortions And if you genuinely believe that feminists don t care about female mental health then perhaps I can understand why you were so surprised that suicide figures exceed homicide figures because you must be pretty damn ignorant There are an abundance of mental health charities geared towards women that were founded by feminists And feminism as an epistemology has a whole wealth of literature on mental health so I ve no idea where you arrived at that conclusion

MensRights,1616955294,        I can give you   more links are sources tell you to read this and that but it is all useless As I said go to any lawyer cop  a woman lawyer cop all you want They will tell you how incredible false rape cases are  amp  x   B i had written the below post in r india around  weeks ago but for some reason the post was   My mother a lawyer quite a reputed one tells me that       of all rape cases filed in Mumbai are false non genuine I have been warned by my mother never to use dating apps or to ever be in a live in relationship Even on the internet I remember reading an article by a woman lawyer from Delhi who described herself as a feminist stating how    of all rape cases in Delhi are false I did not think much about it until a colleague of mine was threatened with one and had to pay  lakh in avoid to be implicated in a false rape case  After researching about it and talking to several people the issue seems to bigger than I ever thought of Most rape cases in tier   tier  cities are just women filing it after a relationship turns sour In many cases it is the woman s parents that file rape cases In northern India especially in Delhi many parents file rape cases against the girl s ex boyfriend lover just to dissuade him from ever talking to the girl again Many parents also file rape cases against the girl s ex boyfriend lover as a rape victim is considered to more honourable than the girl having previous relationship A rape victim has to give less dowry than the girl having past relationship This might seem absurd and even laughable  but it happens and it happens a lot Some tips to avoid being implicated in a false rape case    Never just never have sexual relation with your girlfriend until you get married to her In India a man can never leave his girlfriend after he has had sexual relations with her Heck he can never leave her even if he sees her fucking with another man That is how fucked up Indian laws are   If possible never ever talk to your female colleagues in your office Now this might seem extreme to some but these days you never know People who work in young startups probably know what I am talking about There is a huge division these days between men and women working in young startups Even in USA where I lived and wasted  years of my life I could see how divided men and women were in my office post the me too movement I see a similar trend happening in India these days   Never hire a female maid if possible Maids falsely implicating the men in the house has become really really common   Do not ever argue with women for parking spots and don t ever get into a road rage fight with a woman for the woman can charge you under sec     outraging the modesty of the woman Now this doesn t take away the fact that most genuine cases      go unreported or that much of India especially the Hindi Heartland can be an absolute nightmare for women All I am talking about is tier  and tier  cities Edit For people who think that cases which are not proved in court are termed as false cases are wrong For example USA has a rape conviction of around        But    rape cases are not considered false I am talking about cases which are proved to be downright false after due process of court I am also talking about cases where the girl has filed the complaint on  false pretext of marriage Edit   I write this post after doing extensive research on this topic for one whole month In the space on  month I talked to some      lawyers  almost everyone in my extended family is a lawyer  a cop read several articles I could back up my claims with endless sources and links but choose not to For people who doubt what I have written they can themsel go to any cop lawyer in any tier   tier  city they want to

MensRights,1616955114,I don t think it s no different for women I feel like the way I see sexually appealing guys and gals has the same stimulation for when men sees a sexually appealing woman I think the only reason why advertisements doesn t have sexually appealing men for female products is that we get stimulated visually but it s not enough reason to blindly purchase commercial goods  It s the same sentiment for why people don t feel sexually harassed when I m near them I find people sexually appealing but it s not enough reason to make them feel uncomfortable  I m not yet married so I have no say for married couples but when I was in a serious relationship clothes didn t matter at all I wore shorts and good looking clothes because they make me feel good I liked the feeling of being pretty even in ordinary clothes Not once did it occur to me to wear revealing clothes just so I can attract people  I sincerely think that if partners want to keep their options open they wouldn t seek it from shallow people who gets easily sexually tensed over some skin The reason she s with you isn t because you got sexually aroused when you saw her pretty it s because you re a good natured person so if she likes to seek other partners it ll be someone who is much good natured as you are but less toxic 
MensRights,1616954936,I mean stuff here in south africa is kind of weird in terms of a lot of stuff like court doesn t really have the people besides the judge the accused accuser and their lawyers there aren t the civilians is what I mean like there s a bunch of murder I guess but there s also a large amount of rape last I heard the rate s roughly     Which isn t good considering I ve got many female relatives and that s bad enough but also of course the court s response to rape cases the defendant s lawyer strategy is usually to intimidate the victim into silence with lots of questions which is hard on them as   well you know now the strategy s bad enough but a lot of the time when they have all the evidence they need guy still goes free due to judges here being weird I mean at least the healthcare here s better though I mean you can give birth for free at least Like it would be cheaper to fly from the USA to a hospital here recover here and then fly back than just the cost of giving birth there  Gotta love how some feminists care about smaller issues in america  like sexist air conditioning  but bigger issues like rape in south africa lotsa human rights violations in  specifically urban like small isolated villages India  the cities are hellholes for dudes legally though  and I m sure other countries they don t talk as much about Also the fact that they not only don t help MR  which in itself isn t great but isn t condemnable  but they actively fight against it like Mary P Koss  reason why men cannot who get raped are not considered to be raped legally  my point A fair amount of feminists focus all their attention on problems that minorly affect a few people yet ignore the larger issues and also actively try to prevents mensrights Used to be feminist not anymore

MensRights,1616960308,You can t fix gynocentrism It s hardwired into our species for men to protect and provision for women However what always made it fair and effective is that men were given the authority to protect and provision Women being physically weaker and vulnerable when bearing children had a biological need to transfer accountability for the family s safety to men In order for men to take accountability they also required authority You can t protect a person that refuses to listen to you The problem we see is gynocentrism which is the female privilege of abdicating accountability to men has run rampant while its necessary counterpart male authority has been completely squashed Western countries are mostly democracies where the vote of the majority holds the power Since women are slightly more of the population and have a much stronger in group bias they tend to vote as bloc and they tend to vote for policies that on the surface benefit themselves The problem we see is just going to continue to get worse because women as a group hold much more political power The only way to fix gynocentrism in Western society is to reestablish patriarchy and curb female power Which that doesn t get rid of gynocentrism which is simply hardwired into our biology but it balances it out in a system that works However since voting rights are the only way to do that it won t get done Men have collectively agreed that women should have equal power in the voting booth there s not any political will among men to collectively curb the female voting bloc Some folks have proposed an alternative that only net tax payers  those who have a  stake in the government should be allowed to vote I think this would be a good alternative because it s not gender based and the net effect would be that it would deny people voting themselves more and more of the government s money  women collectively pay only half the taxes men do yet receive double the amount of total government benefits  
MensRights,1616960218,You shouldn t have to resort to comparisons to Jim Crow the idea of a  pm curfew for men should be unpalatable to most people on it s face 
MensRights,1616960212,Look at the post again   The post is about men not women   Just because a woman is saying it doesn t mean its a post about women Its a post about how society esoecially women thinks about men That s why we go our own way Coz we know society doesn t care about men anyways So why should we care 
MensRights,1616960083,No you didn t I ignored your comments but they were hateful and abusive
MensRights,1616960070,Dial it back Cathy Newman What I am saying g is that of natural born children are important to you then you deserve to pursue what s important to you Should a man marry a woman who refuses to have children if he desperately wants children Should a man sacrifice his dreams because the woman he s with can t have children These questions have obvious answers when the genders are flipped The answers are opposite in this scenario because the aggrieved is a woman I guess the real answer in both situations is whatever is best for the woman   
MensRights,1616960025,LOL How does that question not apply to woman and having the Twitter account  Men take all decisions in the company Women get a twitter account And somehow   the latter is the problem And I get to answer silly questions for pointing it out

MensRights,1616959819,I would go one step further and say women are actually more violent than men It s just that their ways of perpetrating violence are often indirect and non physical so they go unnoticed All female environments are definitely more toxic than all male environments

MensRights,1616958703,Are you fucking dense or what Twitter didn t made any OFFICIAL account for men so yeah it s sexist but honestly I don t blame then because they are following TRENDS because it s a company They won t face bad PR because they made a  TwitterMen  account it s just that in today s society  men can t face sexism   I don t say it s worse for them or it s as bad but at least they are facing it from time to time but in society men s problems are seen as a joke That s it end of story How are you still not getting the damn point ffs We are talking about OFFICIAL account Having somebody making an unofficial one isn t the subject there also must be some and finally you can t make yourself an account  TwitterMen  because the Twitter name belongs to Twitter only that s it Now if you still don t get the point you must be trolling I don t want to think that you are that stupid to not understand something as simple as that 
MensRights,1616958611,May be off topic but this whole  men are trash  Kill all men  garbage has got me thinking that if you cut out most of the male population humans will die out eventually  We only need some of you for repopulating  they ll say So basically we just force men to give up their sperm  or would it be taken by force My body my choice  remember 
MensRights,1616958603,The other sex  I didn t know a sex could make decisions Are men like the the Borg or something

MensRights,1616966947, gt  no stop raping me  Lol Do you have experience with this statement being shouted at you 
MensRights,1616966929,Judging by your comment history you are obviously have an issue with men talking about their issues without  feminist supervision  I e the discussion should focus on how women are the victims and men need to be less toxic  I invite you not to participate in this subreddit and instead spend your time in subreddits you ll feel more comfortable in  misandric feminist subs Bye and blocked 
MensRights,1616966910,As violent I think it s good to acknowledge the fact that we are all equal but we shouldn t go to their level
MensRights,1616966904,Im not such a low life to do things like that but ok
MensRights,1616966840,Big assumption for someone who does not know me in real life  you could not be more wrong  My partners have varied physically in every way but they all have similar hobbies and interests They ve all been nerdy comic book types that love video games and philosophical discussions none of which were about dick size by the way I ve learned that sex has zero to do with size but rather about the overall connection and communicated preferences Your dick is not all that we care about Sorry to break the tough news

MensRights,1616966671,Manhood is cringe too you forgot that one    I just want dignity not  lordship or anything as special 
MensRights,1616966639,Green party MP stated it as a comparison to what females were being told by the police in aftermath of the Sarah Everard murder in the UK Police suggested women stay inside to feel safe and Greens basically said isnt this the same as enacted a legal bound curfew on men   Yeah the greens are mental

MensRights,1616966437, gt Because when feminist movement was started womens issues were really fucked up Debatable  gt so it s main goal was to improve their rights until men and women were equal And they ve achieved that and then some But again I ask if a movement is about both sexes why does it have to have the feminine adjective attached to it Why not egalitarianism 
MensRights,1616966410,I had in mind certain tribes where if a man is witnessed spending time alone with a woman it automatically means that they re getting married But I don t think we re going to get back to that extreme The return of cultural norms restricting male female interaction would probably be a mixed bag  It seems like the current situation around dating flirting and sexual dalliances could potentially be improved if there were more commonly agreed rules It might mean less tragic dangerous situations and negative outcomes On the other hand reduced interaction between men and women would probably increase the power of gender specific expectations and norms of the kind that we ve spent decades dismantling 
MensRights,1616966402,On the brexit sub there was a troll  aweless everyone knew what he was and was treated like the village idiot Make that the attack plan I m against banning I m sticking to it This is a place for ideas It needs to be open or we disappear into the bubble 
MensRights,1616966375,Honestly i m not sure why the guy in the artile doesn t seem to know that Uber doesn t owe him a job I agree that it s a super duper shitty thing for them to have done specifically in how they re denying him due process but that all seemed pretty spelled out in the contract documents he signed 
MensRights,1616966213,Men s opinions shouldn t be invalidated but most of the comments made are when women are talking about their experiences it s not your issues don t matter or are wrong it s just that when talking about the issues that women face there doesn t need to be an opinion that doesn t help solve the problem women face 
MensRights,1616966128,As if it isn t enough already   the fat jokes the man tit jokes the height jokes dick size jokes insecurity jokes jokes about everything from shape size of eyes nose hair head ears teeth stomach feet hands   these are just a few I ve heard said to other men before and it s disgusting 
MensRights,1616966099,There s a difference between exposing and shunning a random idiot and a hateful feminist troll who attacks literally every single day Enough is enough
MensRights,1616966096,Let s just be switches  Got to keep the fire burning  
MensRights,1616965984,True but I have said some pretty nasty shit to people on here And I m fine I would offer to report But I m against censorship exposing and shunning That s what I m comfortable with 
MensRights,1616965978, gt women can lie about being on the pill and force men to be dads if they think they can cum in that woman s vagina If you don t fully trust that woman then why are you cumming in that vagina   gt Men need to be able to have a stake in this whole thing in order to give them an out to not be a father He does not cumming in a vagina  gt all this stuff where women get all this leverage The leverage of bodily autonomy Or the leverage an infant has by needing cs payment These are both really important to me  gt because women abuse the system in their favor because it already skews toward them Then let s do something about it 
MensRights,1616965937,I kind of already do honestly but I think the fault mostly lies on close minded people who make it their life s mission to hate people different from them 
MensRights,1616965858,Not yet   but it ll be me a man and MRA before a feminazi troll spewing hate speech every day That s NOT acceptable on a sub like this  The mods should support us
MensRights,1616965795,If you care about  hatespeech  why dont u care about this comment then   hypocrisy
MensRights,1616965769,Nah  women are more violent   men are just better at it 
MensRights,1616965690,Male curfew That can t be real Who would enforce it The police who are mostly male 
MensRights,1616965631,You NEVER speak for or support men s issues you only troll and belittle men with your sexist hateful feminist agenda If you really cared about equality you would at LEAST speak out on extreme sexist subs like FDS   but instead you just attack men
MensRights,1616965619,This sub doesn t like banning That s why I appreciate it Doesn t mean we can t get the community aware and basically boot  m out with negative feedback 
MensRights,1616965604, I m talking about normal casual clothing you d wear in your house most people don t dress like strippers in their own house this includes women as well Even when I wear traditional clothing my mom never fails to tell me that my clothes don t fully cover my legs  even if I m wearing loose pajamas or that they re slightly see through or I m bending too much when these are literally the clothes she brought for me herself 
MensRights,1616965487,but it is an issue they bring up and it s hypocritical because they make comments like this 
MensRights,1616965481,We need to get this troll banned  I report it all the time but no one gives a shit
MensRights,1616965401,It is essentially a form of Victorian era style chivalry We re starting to go full circle back to that stuff 
MensRights,1616965393,That isn t the point   of course anyone can tell the difference The point is when it s used to later make false allegations when the woman was actually consenting all along
MensRights,1616965348,Man and wife are one shi what one is dealt so is the other I d say fiances are pretty dang close Sure the threshold for acceptable reasons to break off an engagement is less strict than the acceptable reasons for divorce but clearly you Think engagement has no degree of commitment at all 
MensRights,1616965320, gt Someone should spray paint that over it and see the reaction That s actually pretty clever 
MensRights,1616965312,False allegations are rampant right now and getting worse   this is a perfect example of how you can be set up
MensRights,1616965261,How do we get this clown banned I report all his sexist trolling but no one cares
MensRights,1616965260,I don t have the slightest idea  It would be nice if it did though 
MensRights,1616965215,Yeah the original was my post It was sitting at    upvoted and  upvoted until it got a few more and it at  last I checked
MensRights,1616965207,This is all a communication issue in general Everyone is different and if you re in a romantic relationship with someone else this is a conversation that needs to be had People need to open their fucking mouths and TALK to each other more
MensRights,1616965200,Just because you haven t experienced it yet Does not mean women can often just communicate completely ineffectively  The famous you pick I don t care but immediately shoot down your suggestions No Im not hungry except for your fries Now this is light hearted But whenever the communication is poor where sex is involved It s dangerous to the man really fast   This guy has great points about it Men and women think differently That s why they often don t understand each other 
MensRights,1616965086,Awwww   thank you Does that mean you are now my bitch  
MensRights,1616965044,The problem is these people take out their hatred on people women especially sometimes in extremely inappropriate and cringe ass ways I used to be the same way a few years ago and looking back makes me so embarrassed of myself Incels need to understand that their anger is valid but going around and screeching about how bullshit the system is isn t going to get them anywhere They need to channel that anger into bettering themselves and their situation
MensRights,1616964912,Gynocentrism without appropriate limits leads to Matriarchy We have already travelled far along this path The results will ultimately me as damaging to women as to men 
MensRights,1616964844,Lol Body shaming is not the main issue when it comes to actual feminism 
MensRights,1616964810,I m not interested in your thoughts Written off as a agent provocateur 
MensRights,1616964774,I feel like the brits really know how to make something look and feel dystopian At first blush I d agree with a commenter at the original post and say that this has a weird gender segregation vibe and I m aware of the wider context and the purpose of these  rules  On the other hand maybe our culture s brief experiment with men and women interacting freely in any public situation was never meant to last This could be the beginning of the re establishment of the usual rules and taboos around male female interaction that have existed in most cultures in history 
MensRights,1616964669,Gtfo of here with that  incel bullshit I m not some fucking  incel  I m just telling the Truth 
MensRights,1616964612,Can you not tell the difference between a playful  Nooo   don t spank me daddy And someone screaming  no stop raping me     Someone s fantasies are not an excuse for sexual assault There is no  grey area  There is no stereotype that women don t know what they want They do try talking to them    This isn t a  confusing issue  If you find the concept of consent difficult to understand then I would be happy to answer any and all questions you have    Some women may be capable of some toxic behaviour but here it looks like you are making assumptions and misunderstanding to make divisive claims  Now thinking about it this post must either be written by an incel making excuses for himself or a shill trying to start shit Which are you 
MensRights,1616964606,Visit GoodBlacksGuide co uk and help whites feel safer on the streets    Rule    Don t approach them Any interaction can be intimidating   Sounds pretty racist if you change it from men women to black white Someone should spray paint that over it and see the reaction 
MensRights,1616964580,plain and simple its child abuse and abuse of authority to denigrate minors in your care want proof  then apply the same principle to any other group with immutable characteristics race skin colour gender eg the girls  religion sexuality disability age if you say no to any  of those groups above then forcing anyone to apologise for their gender is abuse
MensRights,1616964567,I don t want to go find them by itself if you really care
MensRights,1616964512,I don t consider myself an MRA I consider myself someone that cares about issues that men face disproportionately but with no interest in taking anything away from the women s movement that feminism spearheaded  So I call out poorly worded posts and upvote posts that are direct mens issues The  no means  yes mentality isn t good for men or women so perpetuating that idea is bad for everyone Which is why I m critical of this post 
MensRights,1616964459,I d like to accuse Uber s CEO of sexual harassment and remarks No proof was needed to fire the driver so no proof should be needed in my case too right 
MensRights,1616964449,The point is that a man or two in charge does not speak for or represent every guy in the company and every guy in the company is not in charge If a woman or women were in charge of the company would it be equal if only men were allowed to have a sanctioned company Twitter account  The whole thing seems kind of silly 
MensRights,1616964395,I don t have shit to back up we are not spreading important infos over serous topics you are just so mad about me saying that tik tok is shit that you now expect like scientific staying about my statement and couldn t notice how much of a fool you ara looking like

MensRights,1616964266,This looks like a response to a completely different discussion to be honest  But feel free to rant if it makes you feel better 
MensRights,1616963999,You claimed that users of social media are more self obsessed and ego driven Start there 
MensRights,1616963922,If its ridiculous then its just as ridiculous as this sub and your  this post isnt about women comment  I agree that men and women both have advantages and disadvantages but surely men dont havent had to face as many disadvantages as women  throughout history   And you can inform yourself about that easily If you call me therefore a supremacist then what are yaaalll here then Its also interesting that you decided to insult me whereas I didnt insult you once Question that or stay in your comfortable lane 
MensRights,1616963883,Lol As if feminists don t complain about body shaming all the time and even created an entire movement based off of it 
MensRights,1616963871,The fuck kind of sources do you want Wait let me go search on google  why tik tok is the definition of circus so that I can make you stop bitching because  wHErE tHE sOUrCEs  
MensRights,1616963804,Nope just that you say shit without backing it up and then get angry when asked to provide proof 
MensRights,1616963769,Demanding sources for incorrect unvalidated claims is  foolish now Thought we were supposed to be above these insane emotional arguments 
MensRights,1616963687, gt All female environments are definitely more toxic than all male environments Very true 
MensRights,1616963584, gt It is far more reasonable to compare genders in homicide rates than bringing suicide into the equation Bullshit   The ONLY reason feminists point out homicide rates against ADULTS is to coward the narrative of  men bad  When you look at violence against CHILDREN  something feminists rarely talk about  the great majority of that is perpetrated by women Feminist  femwash violence against children by lumping it in with violence against women  i e men s violence against women and children thereby reinforcing the  men bad narrative  The bottom line is that violence by men against women is by far the LEAST numerous type of violence in our societies and it is hugely exaggerated by feminists as part of their narrative And no feminists put virtually no effort into the issue of   suicide   
MensRights,1616963575,Stop smoking nuts fool your are just mad and being mad makes you spit nonsense

MensRights,1616963175,Yup   we ve come full circle right back to extreme racism and sexism
MensRights,1616963013,Unfortunately that is unironically what modern feminists believe That female investment bankers and CEOs and celebrities are opressed while male minimum wage workers are privileged
MensRights,1615941132,What s the criteria for a rape case being false If you look into how difficult rape is to prove in the first place you could claim that any rape allegation that doesn t lead to arrest etc is false despite that not always being the case 
MensRights,1615941072,Naw no mgtow mra might take a couple decades but then it might be fine
MensRights,1615941008, Here is the current scientific consensus on the rate of false rape accusations   You can  very easily read this paper and other modern papers on this topic before getting back  Most are available for free

MensRights,1615940297,What this guy said Unless you have an actual EDI policy and plan that state the organization is agreeable to selective hiring she is as guilty under the law as any person within an organization with prejudice against race orientation of potential employees She should be  offered to quit 
MensRights,1615940017,It s not all men it s too many men Ask any woman you know and I bet she s dealt with sexual harassment We say all men because we don t know who we can trust That s the response you d get Or something close to it It s nonsense but hey no point trying to use logic against feminists 
MensRights,1615939529,Fire her And make sure this is all documented for when she sues 
MensRights,1615939426,Thanks dude but the feminists will just say that men changed her statement
MensRights,1615939255,you know that lots of false accusations are in social circles right for example Jaxon lister s situation he was accused by  girls in his school the girls never reported it instead they went to Twitter and other   girls came out saying he raped them  later it was revealed that the   girls don t even live in his state and some lives in the UK   amp  x   B lots of fake accusations are told to a couple of people in a small social circle  like college work environment school etc  these are some stories        amp  x   B as i remember from reading them most of the stories weren t reported to the police it was a word that got from a girl around to her friends and other ppl i know this is anecdotal but no one cares enough to make studies about the problems that men face
MensRights,1615939207,This article provides no info on the claim itself and is basically useless 
MensRights,1615939112,Send her some dumb young woman with colored hair with a piercing in the nose
MensRights,1615939068,Tbf I d say men s clothes are generally more  gender neutral 
MensRights,1615939049,Keep up with the counterproductive attitude you re part of the problem as to why this movement is labelled as sexist  more so about bitterness than actual men s rights and that shits super obvious hell I even explained it for you but that s still not enough  Like this issue wasn t even inherently about men s rights I gave a very valid and realistic counterpoint to your shallow emotional and reactionary one and all you can do is crawl away and insult me from the losers bench  Focus on important things rather than getting distracted by childish ideas it ll go a long way regarding your maturity  or like lack of  Or maybe you just need some time to grow up a little idk up to you let your mental age catch up to your biological age a bit
MensRights,1615938966,Yeah this is what I hate My father who is    years old and has been working in IT for over thirty years sense the mid to late    s has years of experience under his belt that nobody young will have but fortunately he has never met somebody like this for a job interview becuase if somebody said this to him he would flip the fuck out at them

MensRights,1615938862,You re right I linked a secondary source in that comment Here s a primary source  meta analysis that finds a     prevalence of false sexual assault claims across  recent reputable papers    It s interesting that you point to the  poor methodologies of these  biased feminist papers when I have a strong feeling you ve never read any literature in this field and you certainly don t understand research methods  again research methods which you don t know because you haven t read the papers across social sciences  Why is it that you scrutinize those papers you haven t read  but disagree with yet fail to even acknowledge obvious shortcomings in the paper this entire post is based on 
MensRights,1615938848,I love all the comments at this but the sad thing is if you did any of these you yourself would get in trouble it s almost as if you can t do anything other than record it until you end up getting sued  
MensRights,1615938774,I get that exact argument at work  Why why oh why do our female employees always take more time off to raise a child than our male employees This allows men of equal age to get ahead in promotions    Maybe it s because you offer six times as much leave to women than you do to men And you ll hold a woman s position open unpaid for  years but don t do the same for a man so he s forced to return to work    Why we just can t work it out Men must hate their children  
MensRights,1615938759,Maybe the girls can be in a separate troop I don t really care about that part  But really  Scouts BSA That s sounds fucking dumb  Don t destroy the Boy Scouts Fix the Girl Scouts to be able to do the type of stuff the Boy Scouts do It s very anti  feminist of them to not show that they could fix their organizations problems and instead just migrate to another one It s called Boy Scouts of America not fucking  Scouts Boy Scouts of America

MensRights,1615936715,Read what I said or at least refute my counterpoint in any capacity No point in still responding if you aren t doing that  I just explained how I support men s rights and gave my opinion on how your type of mindset is counterproductive The constant unnecessary accusations are so boring respond to my points with counterpoints of stop responding altogether  This doesn t go anywhere if you never explain how I m wrong in any capacity Obviously it would give me the impression that they still stand so repeating the same thing over and over would never change my opinion if you give any sort of valid criticism or rebuttal

MensRights,1615936591,Well then we re in complete agreement my dude because the only thing I was disagreeing with OP over was calling women terrorists and then someone defended his use of the word terrorists I was like dude wtf and based on your previous comment it sounded like you agreed with them about the terrorists thing and I was like holy shit how many of them are there So I m glad to see that you don t really like the terrorists thing either because for the most part aside from a few semantics I completely agree with your comment above and it lines up with my research and experiences Edit also I suggest reading up on my other thread with the OP commenter he just sounds like an extremely bitter person I doubt he understands what he sounds like 
MensRights,1615936569,The first thing and probably the greatest issue we have is a lack of dedicated services of any kind at a government level There s no department of men s health or ministry of men s affairs at any level of any government Not that I m aware of anyway  It s quite impossible to solve a problem while addressing only half of it and that s what governments in the developed world have been doing for at least   years now It should be fairly obvious how that s worked out so far

MensRights,1615936052,Thats a different way of looking at it Unfortunately though in the event of divorce splitting up it isnt really uncommon for men to end up paying support for a child that is not theirs if the court deems it  best for the child and the real father isn t in the picture Paternity tests at birth would give men a chance to jump ship early enough to where the child would never form a bond financial dependence on them plus that would look alot more favorable in court should it come to that  Keep in mind that this opinion is coming from a   year old without kids yet so it should be taken with a grain of salt I m just thinking about this more in terms of my near future as I really do want a family and children of my own but the happy family is a real rarity these days unfortunately Nothing scares me more than starting a family just to have to watch it fall apart

MensRights,1615950496,So a woman you dated can go to court and lie about you because shes angry say you stalked her say you re dangerous and a threat and since     of restraining orders are passed regardless of their merit and women know this  you lose your god given right to protect you and your family Bear in mind the accused never harmed threatened or assaulted anyone I know this because it happened to me a woman I broke up with and hadn t spoken to in  years I messaged her after I broke up with my current gf and because she was still mad about old drama decided to punish me with a false restraining order It s called restraining order abuse This bill does nothing but disarm people I ve never committed a crime in my entire life never even had a speeding ticket I ve never raised my voice to a woman I ve never stalked or hit a woman The aforementioned woman was however abusive to me physically and verbally as have several woman I ve dated been It was obviously a mistake messaging her but I didnt deserve what happened to me This does nothing but give women even more privilege and power in the family court system but this time their abuses aren t limited to actual family I spent       and endured psychological abuse trying to stop my abuser only to unjustly lose but it wasnt so bad because I still had my gun rights Now you want to take away my ability to defend myself and my children What if someone breaks into our house while we are home Guns should only be taken away from people who are actually aggresively violent who have caused physical harm and not in self defense I know I m not the only one There are millions of silent men like me Restraining orders dont work the best thing for a woman to do to defend herself is to become proficient with a firearm and carry daily A piece of paper will not protect you from an abuser who likely has nothing to lose anyway and you should take responsibility for your own protection not put it into the hands of strangers Did you know it s common for the woman s defense attorney to press for a domestic violence protection order at the beginning of a divorce in order to stack the bargaining chips in their favor Who could possibly imagine a woman abusing restraining orders to get even no that would never happen

MensRights,1615950138, In society s eyes men are unclean while women are clean  Holy cow I never realized some people think this It used to be the other way round historically because of menstruation In many societies men were banned to bathe in the same pools women used because women were considered unclean Even today I wonder what argument can be made to consider men less clean than women because women menstruate while men don t hence men don t need all kinds of pads and tampons to stay clean but also because women spray urine differently than men who urinate with a clean narrow stream that can be directed straight into the drain It is really dubious that anybody can make a nature based argument Hygiene habits on the other hand very by person not by gender Most men are very clean as far as I know and I am one

MensRights,1615948794,Abolish the Duluth Model Replace the VAWA model with The Violence Against Family Act like it used to be l Include Made to Penetrate in the definition of rape so that male victims can get justice Due process not just for false accusations but courts in general  Removing the bias against men in family court  Do not mention the name of the victim and perpetrator in rape cases before the accusation has been proven many times the court of public opinion is more dangerous than the actual court  Helping the Men in prison who get raped and sexually harrased on a daily basis but the media doesn t shine a single light on them

MensRights,1615968294,It s a shit argument because it s utterly and completely irrelevant to  the degree of direct harm suffered by the male victim  the after effects of that harm suffered by the male victim  the male victim s need for support and assistance whether the perpetrator was a man or a woman When the topic of discussion is the victimization rate of men it s simply not very relevant There s also no such thing as  male violence  any more than there is  asian female opioid abuse  Women also commit violence not  male violence  but violence

MensRights,1615967815,That  in  and  in  statistic is misleading The CDC study which came up with that expanded the definition of rape to include many more people One example is a sexual encounter counted as rape if you had drunk alcohol While I agree being black out drunk and unable to consent is rape having a bit of alcohol does not make it rape This counted up to a  rd if their total rape statistics

MensRights,1615964954,Bro  shorts hail in comparision to mini skirts The average length of shorts are about   inches meanwhile mini skirts are on average  inches or even shorter Also the reason why men don t wear skirts is because a hetrosexual man wearing a skirt isn t going to get with women  furthermore men have actually worn skirts in the past however those skirts were much more straight than female skirts Furthermore  you re just victim blaming  couldn t you say the same about wearing trousers in the    s Like do you seriously think women accepted other women who wear trousers Like I don t know why but this idea that discrimination of men is null if men discriminate against each other however even in this context women make fun of men too The reason why men don t wear skirts is because its not socially acceptable unless like in Ireland  its a different type of skirt  in addition  most men are hetrosexual  meaning if they want to get with women they have to be masculine Like men are attractive to women because they re men  women are attractive to men because they re women however saying your prefer feminine women is somehow a hot take in alot of circles I don t know man  you can prefer anyone you want however if you criticize someone s preferences meanwhile your preferences are the same then you are a hypocrite

MensRights,1615964348,Here s an idea for an argument Imposing matriarchy instead of gender equality Since I m a feminist I believe that  the world is patriarchal in nature in that men still have certain ethical grey areas where if you do it you re the man but if we do it we re  insert derogatory female slur here  However I also don t believe the world is still strictly patriarchal Gender roles are already comparatively fluid compared to   years ago Now the problem here is when  extreme feminists control their narrative it s always  We can do it too no matter the context Worse still this extreme side of feminism actually prohibits men from impeding on  female territory  removing the possibility of men being a victim while simultaneously stressing that women are too weak to be the aggressor Some have even gone as far as  we can do it better  but cry foul when they are presented the same amount of pressure that men have to deal with I guess my point is although I m a feminist I m very aware of the odd agenda of lowering standards with which women are compared against while the standards for men are getting higher We do need equity so men and women can stand as equals but unfortunately extreme ideals still impede that

MensRights,1615973750,I don t think men can do much about it because it is a deliberate Kafka trap Innocent men are bound to vehemently deny that they would ever commit such horrific crimes because in fact the overwhelming majority of them are in fact incapable of it But the denial itself is seen as a sign of guilt and the small number of repeat offenders are given as proof It s an intentional tactic and in my opinion the only way out is to just not play their game disengage and ignore the accusations without becoming defensive whenever possible In addition I think that women who are not ideological themselves can help get rid of the idea

MensRights,1615988437,Yeah well club culture in general is terrible for everyone Drugs and drinking will screw you up 
MensRights,1615988331,This probably needs it s own post It s too bad the author didn t report the results for the question that was actually about rape I get that  making a woman do something sexually that she didn t want to isn t much better  But I could imagine survey respondents answering  agree in the context of trying to convince a woman to say yes to a specific sex act  For example if it s oral sex offering to also go down on her in exchange for her going down on you I mean they re probably   questions deep at that point so who knows what s going through their mind when if they answer  strongly disagree for the question about rape but then put down  sightly agree to the question about sexual acts As the article points out putting those two questions side by side implies that the researcher is asking something a little different than what the question seems to imply on the surface 
MensRights,1615988326,Indeed Self esteem and an idea of one s self worth is always a good thing however overblown self esteem is a dangerous thing as it s breeds contempt for those you deem beneath you If a girl has a list of demands as long as her arm that no man can possible meet because it s been drilled into her by the prevailing social view   then she will end up alone childless and miserable 
MensRights,1615988304,There was never any intention to actually pass a law that prevents men from going out after  pm  The woman that voiced it was doing it to point out the hypocrisy of people saying women shouldn t go out late if they don t feel safe Although I haven t seen anyone actually say that But acting like this law was seriously under consideration is embarrassing
MensRights,1615988243,Ok that is probably one of the stupidest laws I ve seen in a Western country It almost feels like a sundown town doesn t it Men can be around at daytime but will get driven out by force at night Baroness Jones claims this will make men know how it feels for women   would the Baroness also be willing to live as a Black woman 
MensRights,1615988210,Lol I probably make triple your salary because my dad s a feminist and have always been told to make my own money Men are more likely to be killed by men so you agree men are the problem and are the main threat to mens lives Prize fool  I imagine on the other side of your sweaty grubby crumbed keyboard there sits a bitter and twisted man  because even with your  great personality  no woman wants to fuck you Would you like me to send you a drinks voucher so you can sit and wallow in your little pity party feeling ignored and sorry for yourself 
MensRights,1615988204,The stat isn t faulty The stat is accurate The justification is what can be faulty  Saying its entjrely due to discrimination is blatantly incorrect  That said I think saying  women choose lower paying jobs and take more time off so who cares is also faulty  Why do women have lower paying jobs and why do they take more time off  Assuming genders are equal its weird that so many women are missing so much more work and doing so much less overtime So drilling into that shoukd be the goal of feminists  Not painting it as discrimination alone Thats flawed logic 
MensRights,1615988070,No How many men do you know that dated girls under   when they were     They should have been held accountable for that and the majority  never are  This is the point I m trying to make Hold men accountable  
MensRights,1615988024,Men certainly have a sense of caution around women but it is a really weaker instinct than the reverse for women since the biological cost of a misjudgment is so much bigger for women  without modern inventions that is   Honestly men are better served by tapping into this instinct nowadays because we ve flipped over all the risks and potential costs to men with the help of technology as well as laws Think about it women have multiple unilateral birth control methods and even if they choose not to use any of them they are not burdened by parenthood Men on the other hand have access to one reliable but non unilateral birth control method condoms The only other option for them is to get a vasectomy And with that they can be burdened with parenthood based on the choices of anyone who gets access to their sperm They can literally get raped into parenthood How the hell do men muster the courage to even talk to a woman baffles me sometimes 
MensRights,1615987994,Domestic abuse sexism is common in Spain most often victims being women so yes it makes sense for Spain to do that 
MensRights,1615987986,I bet feminist teachers are salivating over the possible of government permission to practice misandry It s literally government sanction to mentally abuse male students for a paycheck 
MensRights,1615987977,I am also arguing that the wife in this case deserves a share in the combined income by right As the wife s effort in child rearing and cutting down on work hours helped the husband focus on his career despite being a father  wife performed indirect financial contribution  So akin to how investors collect profit a certain share in husbands money belongs to the wife 
MensRights,1615987831,Yet more  All men are trash feminist claptrap The thing is the more they try and drill this in  especially to teenage boys the more they will rebel against the  programming  It s what kids do I have a teenage son and he and most of his friends have no desire to be around girls because in his own words  they are insufferable to be around are entitled demean the boys at every opportunity and are supported by the teachers in this view  We are breeding a generation of boys who will disengage with society and women in particular all because we have let the feminist agenda run riot and tell them they are worthless EXCEPT as a means to support women s ambitions 
MensRights,1615987787,Kafka trap mate I don t know if you ve heard of that statement but Google it Nice lady just told me about that and I m so glad she did 
MensRights,1615987739,You have to define rape as well feminsit would say looking at a womans boobs is rape 
MensRights,1615987715,I have seen women beign victim blamed usually in rape cases Do you want to know a fun fact It s not only men that victim blame I have seen a lot of women doing the exact same thing saying the usual words  she sould have dressed more conservatively and all the other iteractions It s not  more men or more women that victim blame It s shitty people that victim blame In no way shape or form victim blaming is peculiar to one gender 
MensRights,1615987453,I ve thought about this bud but I love love lol 
MensRights,1615987421,Ocasio Cortez is always good for a laugh we ve yet to see if she s ever going to be good for anything else 
MensRights,1615987356,And you only have two comments and no posts for a year account yeah right
MensRights,1615987351,Obviously she was being so kind that she chose to only injure him instead of killing him
MensRights,1615987227,Yeah I don t use reddit because it is full of toxic folks who would not believe things that don t serve their narrative I came to comment since my picture is up there 
MensRights,1615987058,Exactly mate The same rules apply to men and I think why we ve become up in arms as well is because we re also so much more highly likely to be murdered in these situations We know this It s inherent for our survival you could say They re does need to be better policing sentences actually taking action on ALL crimes The world from its inception has always been violent you an I know this  maybe some people don t live in the real world aren t streetwise maybe not excusing anything here There s this victim blaming mentality about women being raped as well    it s erm    
MensRights,1615987050,Lot to unpack here Fathers are legally obligated to take care of their wives and children too I never said women shouldn t perform house work  If a husband already gave a huge amount of money to wife before divorce it can be deducted from alimony You are context dropping while using the difficulties of poor lower caste women as an argument You quoting poor lower caste women is like feminists saying LOOK LOOK AT THE WOMAN WHOSE RECTUM WAS PIERCED OUT DURING RAPE AND THEIR FACES GET ACID ATTACKED HoW DARE YOU FEEL SYMPATHY FOR MEN While you argue for mens rights And imagine a feminist repeatedly bringing up that argument when you talk of men s issues And saying DON T YOU CARE ABOUT RAPED AND TORTURED WOMEN when you talk about discrimination men face I think we can both agree that you thoroughly feel bad for women who get raped and I feel very bad for the hardships that poor women go through To imply that because I am arguing for alimony I somehow donot care about poor women is extremely disingenuous and an argument made in bad faith Err   i never said fathers aren t important I actually made an argument FOR  parent families in my comments Saying mothers primary care givers are important doesn t mean fathers are unnecessary or bad not wonderful After a divorce a woman no longer lives in the same house as the husband Also like you said house rent is compensated through house work We are talking about support that must extend after a divorce to a wife who chose continues to choose to focus on raising children instead of on a career 
MensRights,1615987008,Yes But it would be far easier to have that discussion if feminists didn t use faulty stats as always when they define  EqualPayDay If they had put  EqualPayDay mid to end of january I would have taken them seriously but these liars placed in in march I can play the game of faulty stats too let s talk about  EqualWorkDay Only difference I admit these are faulty stats and don t try to mislead anyone 
MensRights,1615986957,Yeah can t imagine you can afford champagne Honey it s on me 
MensRights,1615986842, gt  in          of men would rape if they knew they d get away with it  That statistic is incredibly misleading It really states that  in  college men would have sex with a random women with no strings attached if they could 
MensRights,1615986812,Wow That s terrible So sorry you re being dismissed and gaslit in this way 
MensRights,1615986680,I ve never heard an answer put so well thank you for this Kafka trap I didn t even know what one was but so grateful that I now do I think so many people easily fall into these traps of entertaining nonsense only further prolonging the nonsense especially nowadays  Just to note on the flip side I think there s a fear from men that women will break their hearts manipulate them cheat on them take advantage of them leave them when they re no longer of use which inevitably prolongs this fearful state leading them not wanting to get involved I think the majority of both sexes overall suffer quite a bit because of these fears ideologies and even dogma in some cases of what the other potential partner could possibly do even though statistically the odds of this are proven to be pretty low It s like the femme fatale thing for men    double edged sword  There s this fear on both sides of not wanting to get our hearts broken and potential grave danger It s kind of like our anxiety systems to warn us of saber tooth tigers  amp cavemen strangers they were good back in the day but they aren t really serving us now This leads to men not approaching and women feeling unapproachable  I d love to know your thoughts on this
MensRights,1615986410,     r MensRights comments koinom some sources on the sexual abuse of men and boys  r MensRights comments f tes  gender parity for sexual assault academic studies Another interesting fact is that most men who rape women were themselves sexually abused as boys by older women I don t have that link super handy right now but the UK empathy gap website has an article there about it  
MensRights,1615986398,Yes you were or you wouldn t have asked why someone didn t defend themselves You never ask about what the victim should have done 
MensRights,1615986327,No sir im not i was just curious to why Now i understand men in the west are being treated unfairly by the justice system 
MensRights,1615986222,Damn how dare I post pictures of myself in the nip with the hopes of making an income out of it Fuck you lol  So you re saying if I was nicer these things wouldn t happen Because they very much do But sure I only post those pictures because i want to be treated like a sex object in my personal life What a fucking genius you are 
MensRights,1615986108,No I disagree Men are much more in danger and should be the focus of the conversation Who cares about women  feeling in danger while they are safe i want to make false all gation a misandrist crime And the all  you ugly and cannot fuck women insult  as if women could decide of my value while they cannot even decide if they are poor victims who need to steal men s money to live or if they are  strong independant women who need no men  
MensRights,1615986101,I agree fully Alimony should be decided on a rational basis and it must be ensured that it isn t exploited 
MensRights,1615986097,You forget to mention how he was asleep at the time so was defense less and she could have killed him before he woke
MensRights,1615985971,I am a bit traditional in this regard I believe that modern work life doesn t do justice to children Then again I can understand parents wanting to work for financial reasons I think parents who can afford to  must spend time with their multiple children from childhood to when they are teenagers And not merely compromise during  infant years of a child s life  But yes alimony should be based on number of working hours spent compromised 
MensRights,1615985956,It is a punishable offense to make a false accusation moron Your first paragraph you agree with me so I d suggest articulating your   point better you thick f CK Also hardly a misandrist I love men especially tall funny rich ones The notches on my bed post corroborate this I just don t like rapists predators bald fat poor and boring ones I m guessing you fit within one of the latter 
MensRights,1615985937,It would ve  been kind of her not to smash a lamp over her boyfriends head 
MensRights,1615985897,I am fine with calculating for room rent and other benefits offered by husband and deducting money for it 
MensRights,1615985548,The vast majority of men are not being used for their money The majority of men are in domestic partnerships with shared responsibilities But yes some men are being used for their money An unfortunate problem 
MensRights,1615985542,Because women cannot use weapon to force men Because women don t pray on boys Because women don t blackmail using false all gations Because women don t prey on drunk drugged disabled men boys Because only physical power matters and because women are angels  If only the majority count How many of are rough sleepers are woman  Less than     Let s ignore them poverty is a male issue Women are so privileged because they don t have to care about living on the road How many women die of drug usage or suicide  Less than     let s ignore them drug and suicide is a male issue Women are so privileged to not be depressed enough to take their own lives or drown in drugs How many prisoners are female  Less than    let s ignore their living condition let s only care about male prisons 
MensRights,1615985374,I don t have an award but I at least saved the post  D
MensRights,1615985326,A study in Sweden found   of people committed nearly twice as much violent crime as the other    combined Likewise a longitudinal study that has been following the same     people since they were born in circa     found   of people are persistent criminals So most men are pretty decent 
MensRights,1615985101,All i hear when i tell women about what happened to me is that statistically they are more often the victims Well thanks that s very comforting 
MensRights,1615985092,Yeah if you could would be swell Let me know when you re about to so can get the champagne out Wasteman
MensRights,1615985011,The word misogny is defined by hate and contempt toward women homophobia and racism are already classified as hate crimes and so should this  if someone s being a dickhead fair but if a woman is abused purely because she s a woman and no other reason it is in indeed a hate crime 
MensRights,1615984776,I m a good father currently on a kangaroo court trial  custody to see whether I can have my children    of the time after a divorce  Ask me who needs to get fought for 
MensRights,1615984629,I see   people really misunderstood my question I was just curious to why im not from your culture This is not fair at all 
MensRights,1615984531,Just look up Caroline flack where she killed herself and suddenly the situation is focused on the bekind movement rather than being about male victims of domestic abuse  If that was a man who killed himself and a woman victim he would have been accused of killing himself to escape conviction
MensRights,1615984527,How do they expect people to learn then If you re posting in good faith even in disagreement I don t see what the big deal is We let feminists trolls say all kinds of bullshit over here But if you add your two cents in a respectful productive manner over there they ban you  That s doesn t seem very fair 
MensRights,1615984514,A study from Sweden looked at   years of violent crime and found   of people were responsible for    of the crimes In other words  person in    commits nearly twice as many violent crimes as the other   combined That s not really answering you question but Now you know 
MensRights,1615984383, gt This small percentage of the population is forged into violent sexual criminals While there may be a subset of rapists that become this way because of abuse this is too much a ton of people don t have any problem being assholes by themselves Even if they re  privileged  
MensRights,1615984345,I have a slightly different perspective on this I belong to an ethnic minority and I have been wary in certain situations because of perceived threats or interactions so I am not unsympathetic to women feeling at risk and seeing it as an imposition on their freedoms However by the same token I did see this as a bit of the  missing white woman trope i e  black women were murdered in a London park in June      by a stranger That failed to capture the zeitgeist utterly and it really requires a degree of introspection by the Twitter warriors many of whom I am sure were supports of the BLM movement 
MensRights,1615984261,I went through the exact same thing as this guy for   years 
MensRights,1615984203,I don t know why you got downvoted I appreciate that you did actually put serious thinking into this and searched for current statistics That s like the main issue with people they accept what is given to them without questioning like the freaking article is from      do your research people 
MensRights,1615984187,Good old  I started attacking you but it doesn t count so you re the only violent one because you defended yourself  
MensRights,1615984180,There are so many examples here on reddit where men speak up and are accused of trying to silence women it s as though DV is the realm and owned by women 
MensRights,1615984172, gt why aren t these so called progressive feminists alarmed that a simple word substitution makes them sound like white supremacists They quote select crime statistics to show things like if a women is attacked then the perpetrator is very likely to be a man and they believe this justifies their hate Funnily racists do exactly the same to try and show that POC are more likely to commit a violent crime than white people So feminist rhetoric is pretty much the same as racists rhetoric and feminists justifications for their hateful views is the same as racists justifications for their hateful views 
MensRights,1615984136,I ALWAYS hear women complaining about being victim blamed but have NEVER actually seen it In Sarah Everard s case I ve only seen men hold the attacker accountable  like any sane human would   In some other cases it s just common sense not to walk in certain areas or do certain things at a particular time That goes for men and women The world will never be     safe and it is everyone s responsibly to be vigilant But even if someone is attacked I doubt hardly anyone will victim blame 
MensRights,1615984120,BUT could he defend himself against the court system the police and possibly males within her family or social circle People forget that if a woman comes forward to report something EVERYONE takes it quite serious 
MensRights,1615983896,About as many as there are men A roughly equal number of men report being raped by women as the other way around 
MensRights,1615983878,The problem is not men speaking up the problem is that when men speak up they aren t listened to I was raped and told when I went to police that it would be he said she said and so they wouldn t proceed with an investigation
MensRights,1615983674,Drinking leaves you in a state where you re mostly unable to defend yourself or recognize risks cause you to make stupid decisions that lead to danger I think that was this person s point Just as if he was completely drunk a man wouldn t see a problem going into a seriously screwed up part his the town wearing his whole rolex collection That s alcohol induced stupidity and it leaves you at risk Drinking screws up with your judgement so it should only be done in safe environments Of course nobody really does that thanks to club culture etc Being drunk yourself put you considerably more at risk than the average person being unable to defend yourself  poor judgement  reduced perception  being visibly weakened  It s the age old problem making it look like just because it s not directly YOUR fault you shouldn t be careful or care about risk reduction The way this person was phrasing it is absolute nonsense  women should receive consequences for doing the wrong thing what the hell particularly when said  consequences can lead to murder but this nonsensical sentence aside there s definitely a serious subject to be had about alcohol here and not only on the perpetrator s side Just because you re not at fault it doesn t mean that it s smart to avoid any precaution and being visibly drunk makes you an very easy target for the worst people out there Alcohol doesn t lead to nefarious activities but it does lead to being a victim of those Which is true for everyone Saying that  it s the other one that s at fault is a non subject since there will always be people like that and way more importantly having someone to be condemned afterward will not fix the fact that your nove have been broken you ve been stabbed you ve been raped So while the  women should receive consequences for doing the wrong thing  part is absolute nonsense the  if someone is going out and getting drunk they are trying to get into trouble isn t The only problem is that nowadays people seem to assume that the whole world has to be and can be a giant safe space and thus it s really hard to talk about this without dismissing it as  let they learn  which is needlessly cruel 
MensRights,1615983659,There s also a bunch of research showing why women make less money than men It comes down to hours worked job choice etc Economists have been saying this for the better part of   years now but nobody wants to listen to them That s why the argument always slides back to  why do women work less than men   When somehow gets twisted around as sexism against women instead of the fact that men get used in aggregate for their money by women 
MensRights,1615997426,Its not  bias against your opinion because X  Its mistrust due to you being a feminist   had my share of trusting this kind of people in my life and im not exactly inclined to do it ever again sorry  usually it ends badly Noone is entitled to be trusted 
MensRights,1615997339,Nah that s just your feminist indoctrination kicking in Crimes against women are not because of hatred of women or their condition as women crimes are always caused by a myriad of other conditions emotional outbursts chance defense response You and your feminist gang just prefer to remove women from the situation and entirely demonize men in whatever situation they are in Hate crimes do not exist and are just another invention to abuse the legal system into tagging everything as a hate crime when men do it 
MensRights,1615997259,To be fair that happens both ways The difference is men get laughed at or humiliated by both most men and women Unless there s a lot of evidence most of the time law enforcement doesn t proceed with a prosecution Obviously it still happens but it isn t  a high percentage Now college is a different thing An accusation is enough to get you kicked out The other thing is if it gets out a  certain number of people will never believe you Sorry you weren t believed It s an awful feeling

MensRights,1615997069,Okay now you re sounding more and more stupid with this example This isn t even about  fairness anymore it s about thinking people  should be held accountable  for what you think is right or not according to your own biases Pitiful And bowing down to people that are also part of the problem themselves isn t  being part of the solution  No matter how  some women feel 
MensRights,1615997022,There s no consistent possible way that can assure everyone that a crime is committed because of someone being a man or a woman hence this entire concept is just idealistic and impossible to enforce in reality Since the concept of  hatred is so subjective and non defined this will just be perfectly abused and missused 
MensRights,1615996989,Isn t that what an ally is supposed to do though Learning all you can about the ideology you re trying to advocate In addition your obvious bias against my opinion because I am a girl and  feminist isn t that a part of what men s rights advocacy is trying to eradicate for your gender It s a common thread in the posts here that I ve read THEY DISREGARD OR DISRESPECT MY OPINION THEY BANNED ME THEY TAKE STANDS AGAINST ME JUST BECAUSE I AM A MAN Yet here you are doing the same Even going as far as insulting me as a person nonetheless 
MensRights,1615996611,I m not gonna address all of those but men don t make fun of other men for having hyper sexuality That is what feminist and the media do 
MensRights,1615996368,Its not about being better its about being safe Its also proper use of diplomatic rule of equal response  If a woman truly advocates for equality then I won t shame her for that  that would depend on her real reason WHY she advocates and what her vision of that equality really is And again it would boil down to  nonexistent  trust

MensRights,1615995408,That s precisely the point The context of this thread is  We will see where it goes next  As in if she isn t fired if the company protects her 
MensRights,1615995318,Because if you leave any mark whatsoever in defending your self you go to jail You can t grab her arms or hold her down If you have any kind of life and anything you care about keeping you just let it happen The men who beat women generally don t have a life and or live in a poverty and or drug alcohol abuse situation It doesn t matter in their lives if they go to jail for a little bit So on the one hand we have images of men getting away with beating women because the punishment isn t hard enough but on the other hand you have a no tolerance policy that hurts men who haven t done anything Being accused if domestic violence ruins a good man s life It doesn t really do anything to a bad man because they didn t really have much to lose anyway

MensRights,1615993835,Many men have committed suicide or considered it over  getting cancelled over a false accusation of rape so you may want to rethink how much it effects people The research on how many rapes go unreported you re referencing can t actually detect it although I think it s true that it s a large percentage and probably a majority But that s also true of false accusations Ignoring that shows a large flaw in your reasoning here

MensRights,1615993573,To add to your statement about equal custody laws if a woman knowingly puts a mans name who is not the father this should be at least a misdemeanor as of current it is non punishable You can sue to get the money that you paid for ie child support but you may not win
MensRights,1615993306,Fair point I think a certain minimal alimony is justified if the lesser paid category is continuing to compromise on career to raise children However all these forms of calculation should be rational I donot think people deserve a share in assets they did not help in building

MensRights,1615992725,If you clarified that asset sharing justifies reduction elimination of alimony I doubt you would get any argument here The problem is that in US divorces  the lesser earning spouse gets BOTH asset sharing AND alimony 
MensRights,1615992481, gt First one The fact is cops kill black men less when you look at kills per    k encounters You know what they say about statistics There are two kinds lies and damn lies It s so easy to pick the statistic which seems to support your claim the best It s no surprise that the prevailing narrative has been forcing people to look at the  deaths per X white people vs  deaths per X black people  And it s because it s the only statistics which would seem to indicate anti black racism If you look at flat numbers far more white people are killed by the police each year than black people So they account for relative population size But then like you pointed out if you also account for relative number of police encounters black people are actually killed by the police  less often than white people So of course they ignore  that factor Include any factor which makes it look  more like black people are being discriminated against Ignore any factor which makes it look  less like black people are being discriminated against Profit It s disgusting through and through

MensRights,1615992120,We are talking about HATE crimes Are most murders against men because they are men No its because someone wants to kill or Rob for the hell of it Plus most perpetrators are MEN A big portion of crime against women and rapes are hate crimes They re done out of hating women and wanting to show that men are above women Silencing voices It s the same with BIPOC and LGBTQ communities Some murders happen just because someone was in the wrong place wrong time but many have a motive behind it Crime aginist women in Spain was due to them being women most often

MensRights,1615991917,What people fail to understand is that while men had more authority power in life in the past they also had more responsibility Example Claim In      women couldn t vote and had little power over their marriage  Counterclaim Yes and if the wife rang up    k in debt the man could go to prison for it He was responsible for her behavior period And that s ignoring the good citizen requirements like fire brigades etc Also many MEN could not vote so    Authority and responsibility Men have been losing authority to women for ages but they ve retained responibility  thanks Feminists  That s why things are so skewed right now Authority and responsibility being severed

MensRights,1615991671,It depends on the kind of persons and interaction you re talking about I can only speak for myself in this of course but it s easy to spot bad actors if your eyes are open Otherwise most men are not genuinely threatening especially knowing that I have all the modern recourses to my benefit We do live in a very sophisticated society In fact I personally find a tiny possibility of danger exciting rather than scary and I m not alone in this  By tapping into that instinct I mean that men should be more cautious about which women they interact with A woman who wants to take advantage of a man has so many tools at her disposal nowadays The drive to have a baby is pretty strong I d say except it isn t a momentary burning desire Its the kind of slow burn yearning that can really drive you mad over time Definitely intrinsic no one has to be taught to feel it

MensRights,1615991474,I literally have a graduate degree in research methods lmao nice try Specifically I have a lot of experience with survey research which is where most of this stuff comes from and can t actually gather data on false accusations for methodological reasons That s why I am able to casually dismiss this stuff and can point out specifics for any paper For that specific meta analysis it s only of  papers which isn t a strong meta analysis at all I can t read it or the papers it references so I can t go into details but it doesn t mention the rate of proven true accusations either it lumps it in with equivocal cases and admits it can t actually say what the false accusation rate is in the final sentence of the abstract There is also pressure on police departments to not investigate accusations to the point where they can be proven false because of pressure from feminists who think revealing the rate of false accusation would make women less likely to report true cases That may be true but men still deserve justice for the false accusations that do occur and deserve the right to be protected from false accusations through punishing false accusers Anything else is sexist Police anecdotally say false accusations are common when under anonymity as well as lawyers that participate in divorce court These are some reasons why you can t investigate these things with a survey of police records or a survey of people themselves 
MensRights,1615991447,So entitled and pretentious I can see you grew up having everything handed to you because of your looks Posting pictures on onlyfans is just the adult version of this Instead of having your parents give you money you just con men into doing it You need to work one of the many dangerous and shitty jobs that men are forced to do because they can t use their looks to generate money Something like that would totally teach you perspective

MensRights,1615991214,Right I believe three facts to be true   Women are more likely to be raped by someone they know than by a stranger   Women are more likely to be raped by a stranger than a man is   Men are more likely to be violently attacked by a stranger than a woman is And if I punch all three of these facts into my handy supercomputer the conclusion it comes to is    beep boop BEEEEEEP Everyone should be cautious walking alone at night It s not misogyny that women are afraid to walk alone at night

MensRights,1615990619,That s a very interesting take  How strong is that instinct that women feel that men could attack them take advantage of them physically sexually how predominant is that When you say we re better served by tapping into this instinct what do you mean and how do you mean it It is crazy I can definitely see why it could baffle you lol I can tell you now that it s their desire to f ck That s it It s the drive or desire to mate Well do pretty mad stuff to get what want  men s sex drives they say are higher how strong are women s drives to have a baby Is it part of their DNA to want to do that So many questions lol
MensRights,1615990513,Regardless of how you want to twist that around I think this statement explains a better part of the wage gap  gt Men choose to work more because of social pressures to earn money to spend on women Something like    of women admit to never dating a man who has less money than them  It is a huge part of how dating and marriage works  And men respond by sacrificing much more for their careers than women do You can think of it as the pressure that women feel to put on makeup and be pretty

MensRights,1616873363,Adding to the apex fallacy is the survivors fallacy CEOs aren t necessarily the best but they are the survivors of decades or work    s of men s and women were competing to get to that position They either gave up moved on or stayed in place The CEO is the lone survivor of all those people fighting to the top It s not because he was smarter or worked harder or is a man but that he survived his way to the top Feminists would like you to believe that it just takes hard work to get to the top and since women work as hard as men it must be sexism preventing them from getting to the top Sure hard work is part of it but if that s all it was everyone would be a CEO The truth is it takes survival and in the rat race men happen to be better survivors That s not because men are better a lot of times it s because men are more desperate Perhaps if there were less social programs supporting women less men willing to marry a lower earning wife and more value placed on what a woman earns instead of how she looks women would be as desperate to succeed in the corporate world as men are and we would see more gender parity at the top But that s not the world we live in and that s not the world feminists are fighting for If anything feminists are making that worse not better Sure they are opening up more corporate avenues to success but at the expense of every other non corporate paths to a successful life 
MensRights,1616873166,when I was little we had a treehouse MADE BY MY FRIENDS DAD FOR ONLY BOYS NO GURLS ALLOWED so I guess this just makes us even

MensRights,1616872975,You re not even being a good troll what s the punchline here 
MensRights,1616872914,The more I read this type of news the more it solidifies in my mind that no amount of activism over twitter or reddit will make any difference at the ground or policy level What are we doing buddies Why are we so damn weak that not even our abuse is deemed to be recognized I m depressed 
MensRights,1616872873,How about Brian Banks Or is that the past too When will we acknowledge that misandry and racism are directly linked
MensRights,1616872839, Regarding his edit  Having a crush on someone is no excuse for grabbing their privates  Otherwise boys would be given free reign to cop a feel of any girl they re infatuated with instead of labeled a sex offender 
MensRights,1615999766,Yeah the statistics Are they talking about statistics that include false accusations against men don t include men who never report their abuse and make assumptions about how many women don t report abuse while not doing the same for men 
MensRights,1615999632,Seriously offer the men the same benefit of leave and most will take it   Furthermore I don t understand that argument at all  No one forced them to have kids  They made a decision that will have lifelong consequences and it s not like it s a big secret that if you re taking years off to raise kids it will affect your career  Businesses have one goal and that is to make money and the unsavory reality is they don t give a flying fuck about you or your family 
MensRights,1615999518,Wow this is really interesting I ve never really talked about it but one New Years I woke up to a then girlfriend doing things to me I never consented to I was boarder line blackout and she wasn t as inebriated Never really knew how to register this but it really messes with your head at times 
MensRights,1615999421,When I was growing up my mother abused my father she even went as far once as to hit him with a fire iron That thing literally bent I ve no idea how my father was lucky enough not to break a bone or something He never hit back he just took away whatever my mother found to use as a weapon and went outside just walked away and came back a few hours later And always came back They re still together for over   years now And for context my father did hard physical labor his entire life even now over   he s strong enough while my mother got really sick in her   s and she s comparatively weak ever since And why She thought he s cheating on him She never had proof and it was always somebody else my father must ve been a male whore in her mind I can t say for certain it never happened I don t think so even looking back He went to work in the morning and came home right away He never drank he never went out whenever he went somewhere it was always with my mother Either way it was abuse I m certain we have no idea how often this happens because men were conditioned to just suppress everything take it and don t complain And when women realize there are no consequences   
MensRights,1615999390,No you should treat EVERYONE as potential robbers it the point 
MensRights,1615999241,Okay here s a simple breakdown Your thoughts are too logical to even consider doing something heinous Which means you think before you do On the other hand the same cannot be said for other people Let me call it something juvenile you do not have crime brain But that is also why us as females or in this case even you guys should know it pays to be vigilant because we do not know which of those around us has the  crime brain  
MensRights,1615999241,Rape shouldn t be the main focus here Don t go out in the dark And don t be careless if you are Doesn t matter if it is rape or an assault just don t go out in the dark in a sketchy area without protection unless you want your kneecaps to be bashed off 
MensRights,1615999217,Lmao hilarious Obviously you didn t know this but women use the phrase  all men to imply that it is impossible to distinguish the so called  good men from the bad men until it s too late When men insist that  not all men are rapists pedophiles murders etc it is clear that their statements are redundant What use is knowing that not all men are bad when so many women are being abused Instead of vehemently arguing the semantics of the phrase work with women to actually change the facts because the reality is women  are becoming victims of abuse at the hands of men at incredibly high rates 
MensRights,1615999208,Why do people always downplay what happens to men by saying that it happens to women too There was no evidence because they didn t want to collect the evidence
MensRights,1615999201,I m so sorry about that I m glad to know that things worked out for you in the end tho
MensRights,1615999165,Didn t Google find that they were actually paying men less in their company so had to give out a bunch of bonuses 
MensRights,1615999087,Which also tells why these people usually don t say anything her friend that said this probably was either very courageous or didn t expect this reaction they d be accused of this even more than random people with feminists probably parroting that they didn t love their children Or that they taught her  internalized misogyny that made her think so 
MensRights,1615998928,I ve seen more men closed fist punched in the face more times than I care to count 
MensRights,1615998927,A colleague of mine actually put up a post saying it was revolting and must be hard for that girls family seeing so many man haters using what happened to her to force there agenda and within minutes he was accused of victim blaming misogyny gaslighting and other assorted shite just because he said her family wouldn t appreciate it
MensRights,1615998923,I find myself falling into typical male roles without realizing working way to many hours so I can take care of everything because I feel like im responsible for everyone s well being I went  months in between jobs once and felt like i didnt deserve to be a man I dont know what any of that means but it can t be healthy 
MensRights,1615998833,Well like I said that s fine That mistrust towards feminists in particular is one thing I learned then Not asking to be trusted  I d find it odd if you trusted me Just asking to not be labelled self centred just because I want to learn these views and opinions Gender equality is just a big thing in my life right now so I m trying to learn all I can about everyone s thoughts Because you can meet a feminist in the streets but guys are less up front about their thoughts on gender 
MensRights,1615998799,Even more disgusting when you know that she wouldn t have wanted her death to be used this way at all But hey criticizing the instrumentalisation of this case is disrespecting the dead Well I m not sure the dead would like to read this 
MensRights,1615998762,This is part that makes me laugh the most I have dropped off and picked up my son everyday to from school for the last  years  It took a full year to stop getting the  is that man a child snatcher look  The visible demeanour change in women to if my son is with me or not is staggering I wouldn t dare approach a woman alone to ask for even simple directions in fear of being accused of something  The best example I have in a play area sitting on a bench watching my boy doing his thing a little boy came up to me  mother  ft behind and said it s my birthday today my reply was happy birthday little man are you having a good day Well the mothers reaction would suggest I d just said get in my van and have some sweets  Yanked the boy away and loudly announce we don t speak to strange men And huffed off less than  seconds later a random woman walks up to her son and bends down pinches his cheek and then exclaimed she over heard it was his birthday  I left before I let it get to me  With my son lol

MensRights,1615998637,Too right misandry has been oozing everywhere since what happened to that poor girl and they are trying to say that now questioning a rape charge is misogyny
MensRights,1615998509,How surprising This being said if they wanted to create misogyny they wouldn t do it any other way These people are the ones that are the biggest disservice to real victims down the line Damn modern pseudo  activists  Also it s related to both their famous  rape culture and the  risk management  victim blaming phenomenon  How funny for them to say that justice itself somehow holds the length of her skirt against a victim when if there s a  rape culture  which is defined as a society that ignores downplay  and normalize rape of course sentencing something is normalizing it  don t bother  it is in fact towards men raped by women  not other men these ones are more or less recognized  Nice role reversal here The kind of people saying this are just narcissistic that are so unable to understand what everyone else is going through that they immediatly think that anything that happens  or don t even happen in the case of the skirt is an attack towards either them or their  labels  Who cares about the fact that women on men rape are pretty much a joke and that the law is explicitly biased against men regarding this which skews with the statistics not believing ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING that comes out of my mouth unconditionally means that there s a rape culture   
MensRights,1615998247,So if I could recount the several times I ve been abused not just physically by a woman I would to whoever would record these events into our statistics but most of these happenings are from over   yrs ago I am now married to someone much more sympathetic and understanding than the women who opted to hurt me  But I can say that each time  I wanted to reach out I was told how futile that effort would be by councillors and police  They knew all to well that my side would not be taken into consideration and I would in fact be the one incarcerated  For over a year I dared not fight back Bruises scratches manipulation insults and hurled objects  she did not stop and always insisted I was the abuser  I struggled for years to find a healthy relationship often falling back in with another abusive type  Thankfully I am here today happy and healthy with my new family Things are much better and I am grateful that this experience taught me how to avoid such vile women 
MensRights,1615998246,I m whining about facts I mean I never ever ever whine and when I do it s cause I ve had enough I m just venting and it s cause I do nothing wrong and still get bitched at for basically having a Y chromosome People make this sub so that people CAN say these kinda things I think if you use any common sense you would know that Someone made this because men aren t allowed to say anything anymore without being the worst person in the world So people use this place to vent If you don t like what s said here then get the fuck out 
MensRights,1615998113,A girl I was at a party with kept touching me   and not on the shoulder if you catch my drift I said I wasn t interested She was rather forceful and kept giving me drinks and propositioning me until I literally blacked out I m sure you can fill in the blanks
MensRights,1615997887,Oh the fact that most of the things talked about here  not all are just whining men trying to band together to whine in unison
MensRights,1615997860,That makes sense I just I see alot of this but I actually tried looking up cases where someone got off by saying that and couldn t find anything then when I tried pointing this out I was threatened to have my work contacted to get me sacked just for pointing out facts
MensRights,1615997760,Some idiots saying this probably exist just as you ll find idiots defending everything  although they d manage to make even this gendered somehow  But implying that a broken justice that manages to get men in jail for years for false accusations somehow  let  real rapists go because hey she was wearing a skirt  What are these people smoking The system is broken to the point where an innocent can possibly be jailed on a woman s word alone and yet somehow justice itself is supposed to be biased THIS way Is this some kind of joke 
MensRights,1615997680,I m more likely to be robbed by a black man should i treat all black men as potential robbers 
MensRights,1615997670,I thought domestic abuse was illegal Why don t they say at the end of the article that if u are a male victim go to the police None of the advice lines fill me with enough confidence to use Untill men get reproductive rights not just responsibility this will continue to get worse With the welfare state and social responsibility at an all time low 
MensRights,1615997546,I will never forget when a female friend of mine said to our group of friends that she punched her ex in the face during their break up and told him he couldn t call the police as they d think it was self defence and arrest him instead She couldn t see why this was an issue I was screaming internally 
MensRights,1615997532,I tried pointing out something similar recently too I was responding to somebody that was talking as if the presence of a woman automatically meant there s immediate danger of being falsely accused and all the shennigans we know are real What bugged me was prejudice I argued that this automatic collective judgement of women was no different from the  we know it s not all men but we don t know WHICH men  misandrist bs on twitter sparked by the recent tragic murder of Sarah Everard As a result I got downvoted I agree with most of the posts and comments on this sub and find it a great opportunity however we seem to be allowing the exact same slip ups as feminism although the extent is smaller as of now We are allowing collective judgement of people based on their gender because it suits our narrative I find that to be cowardly I guess this place isn t     perfect but really no place ever is 
MensRights,1615997521,That s what I was thinking has any guy actually ever said this Because where I am from if you tried to use that in court you d be crucified
MensRights,1615997432,The fact u used  incel as an insult anything that follows is meaningless
MensRights,1616883283,Not how it works  the court gets an enforcement fee back later from fed government usually     Meaning they get more as the more you are forced to pay along with every other poor bastard   billion dollar industry
MensRights,1616883276,Ok who s fault is it that there is no UN men account Its not the people behind the women s account so stop trying to make them look bad The problem with this sub is that all the people here talk and complain about these things but LITERALLY DON T DO ANYTHING TO FIX THEM
MensRights,1616883064,Well I guess I m thinking about lower income people So a kid needs a certain amount of money to be cared for and one low income parent isn t enough So if you have a high enough income you sure can go ahead and adopt  gt  Man must pay for woman choice not matter the age of the  man  Then you haven t been paying attention to what I m saying What s the alternative If the government won t pay and one of the parents won t pay how does this child not live in poverty 
MensRights,1616882707,Some people and for society I think a critical mass are very genitally focussed Thinking about sex usually in its most base forms takes up most of their thinking and so personality This is true for men and women but women seem often to dislike being seen in a base sexual way whilst enjoying seeing others that way Whilst I find such sociatally encouraged hypersexualised sorts to be as disappointing in character as cocaine users I do pity those women who want to act out in this hypersexualised manner but fight to be seen as more interesting and less sexualised This contradiction must make them quite unhappy I suggest you learn from these people Steer clear but learn Decide consciously how you will handle sex in your life and don t pump up your sex drive with society s preapproved lifestyle Sex is fine but it is hardly the most important part of your life or character Even of your relationships with others Almost everything about you is more interesting and fulfilling than your cock Sex beyond children  which is a whole other minefield  is just a bit of fun rivaled by a good meal Don t make sex the most part of who you are Don t define yourself by your genitals Leave that game to  society  and go it your own way 
MensRights,1616882651,The title of this post does not really align with the body The title makes it seem like women live completely perfect lives never face adversity and have no problems and you take issue with implications that they do The body of the post however is pointing out the double standards of the body positivity movement All I want to know is if you generally don t like things that address problems women have or if you just don t like this example 
MensRights,1616882631,Well men bottle it up I used to get hit for crying as a kid out of frustration off my dad I ve forgiven him for that and I don t think he was happy doing that but that s maybe how his dad taught treated him It s like a negative cycle or something that s passed down Sometimes it s easier to physically shut something up than to try and understand it That s like a brutally honest way of describing something like that  I ve heard stories of bullies that bullied kids who went onto be World Champions in the UFC Years later that champion has gone onto see his bully homeless and how years ago when GSP s  champion dad went round to this bullies house to ask to ask his son to stop bullying GSP his dad beat the living  out of his kid GSP s bully was taught how to communicate with his fists  If you cry too it seems like you re not keeping it together But it s more of not being able to suppress it any longer  Men can explode too because they bottle it all up If I just naturally expressed how I feel you wouldn t like it put it that way it s like spitting out a tornado It can be easily misinterpreted as well cause maybe men struggle to make sense of their emotions But if you picture it like soda in a bottle and if it s shaken shaken shaken there s a way to defuse the fizz and it can easily go everywhere if it s not done properly that s how I see it  I cried in front of my GF once because I was about to walk out on her I looked over and she was smiling I said  look at you laughing you don t even care do you  I put her on the spot and I explained why I d been doing all the things I d be doing and expressed myself naturally  minutes later she was in pieces breaking her heart out on my chest crying saying  she can t do this without me and later said she was laughing because she was scared scared of me walking out However she finished me a week later but men and women deal with their emotions differently maybe it s a biological thing or a generational thing but it s not always easy for a man to make sense of his emotions never mind the people around him so he usually locks em up and you ll just see occasionally outbursts every now and then That s how I can make sense of my emotions Past experiences understanding dealing with them and sharing them properly It s not always easy
MensRights,1616882570,People being dicks to eachother I don t think you understand why I am saying this Toxic masculinity sounds like men being nasty because toxic means being nasty or a bully and masculinity is how men behave and stuff like that we don t say  Toxic femininity to describe female sexism do we It overall sounds like a bad name and we just want people to stop using it It isint hard
MensRights,1616882304,Cancel culture is so toxic    It s good you re not ashamed and I have no intention of shaming you Just so we re clear The internet is really confusing  Have you found any women that agree with these ideas I imagine that many would not is that true 
MensRights,1616882001,First thing you need to do to solve your  issues is stop believing in the feminist  toxic masculinity dogma   The whole point of  toxic masculinity is to shift the responsibility of women s behavior towards men into the men themselves Masculinity is not toxic it s the feminist attitudes towards masculinity that are toxic It s the toxic feminist ideology that is trying to impose an unnatural and divisive anti male society that s at fault A system of thought and invented discriminatory practices in feminist ideology culture and economy that feminists call the patriarchy and toxic masculinity The term toxic masculinity is part of the feminist ideology that sees male behaviour within a context of the patriarchy and denies as much as possible that it is    the result of biological differences and    that typical male behaviour is  human behaviour Toxic masculinity isn t about masculinity at all it s all about the negative stereotypes that all men are accused of simply because they are men Men dont hide their emotions because of  Toxic Masculinity  They hide them because no one cares Well that s the problem You take the time to call it Toxic Masculinity when  sexism  oppression and  misandry are preexisting words that fit But for some reason you don t want to use those words     Toxic masculinity was originally created by the mythopoetic men s movement with a completely different definition The mythopoets believed that society was forcing boys to be feminine instead of letting them be themselves   Feminists twisted the definition  by demanding men be more feminine and deciding that they know what s best for men  The feminist definition of toxic masculinity is a backlash against the growing number of men speaking up 
MensRights,1616881991,buzzfeed lol heard they ve been losing money  the past couple years it cant happen fast enough tho   
MensRights,1616881831,I identify as a feminist because I agree with the definition of social political and economic equality of males and females A lot of feminists don t like my attitudes but I d ruffle the feathers of MRAs too because I think a lot of them don t understand feminism I m quite happy looking at both sides Many of the more well read MRAs and feminists would agree on a lot of issues I don t think feminism is marketed well and the name doesn t help because people do easily misunderstand it including many feminists  I identify as a feminist so when I find someone who claims to be feminist who obviously doesn t care at all about men s issues I say they re not feminist They don t like that
MensRights,1616881733,Ok I ll copy and paste it here when I see it again No problem won t take too long Just gotta wait for an unsuspecting feminist to post here asking for some information 
MensRights,1616881713,I pity the fool who is eager to jump to unfounded assumptions 
MensRights,1616881676,Fair enough you re right Tbh maybe there should be a men s twitter I don t think anything s stopping them though so the fact a women s twitter exists is a non issue 
MensRights,1616881625,But what irritates me is that she simplified  thinking directly to  lazy  
MensRights,1616881579, gt The men here don t exactly react well at all Just flying into a hateful rage and being super rude Let me ask you this After the Sarah Everard murder and the subsequent anti male sentiment it stirred up in addition to a  pm Male Only Curfew suggested in jest at the House of Lords can you blame men for lashing out   If all I received is constant denigration and criticism while getting gaslighted for attempting to have my say in the matter told women have it worse I m giving you lip whether you like it or not   You need to be grateful men are keeping things running because you d be singing a different tune if they walked away and systems broke down one after the other 
MensRights,1616881491,It would go more like  no x scotsman dislikes fish and chips or  all x Scotsman like fish and chips  
MensRights,1616881474,I don t need feminism to be a good friend As I said somewhere else feminism is also about recognizing men s feelings and acknowledging that they can have mental health issues or that thay can be taken advantage of or abused by other people This is just example of addressing these specific issues that I wrote about in other comment 
MensRights,1616881444,Saw a commercial on Hulu about women recently losing    million jobs due to the coronavirus Went on to claim how much better the workplace is with women in it and how we need to work to get them employed again I know it s women s history month but still 
MensRights,1616881412,Wow That s super interesting The media really polarizes things Thanks for showing me that 
MensRights,1616881368,Sounds like you only want to  talk to people who ll agree with your POV    That sounds a lot like feminism to me     Feminism Equality when convenient 
MensRights,1616881357,Completely agree It s an embarrassment that OP ever let his mind venture here in the first place I very much doubt he is the type of person that helps the cause Just seems like plane old hypocrisy to me Pathetic misogyny  Mods shouldn t allow trash like this
MensRights,1616881210,This is fucking ridiculous For me male suicide is a big mens rights feminist issues And toxic op is somehow trying to use suicide against victims  If you re  shutting down people with this backwards and pathetic argument I suggest you talk to more intelligent people
MensRights,1616881190, gt Are feminist weaponized and organized Do they posses military Do they run concentration and extermination camps Or is the nacist ideology of superior race somewhat analogy to the equality which is the idea of feminism The Analogy was pointing out the fallacy in your stance fool Comparisons like this aren t supposed to be the exact same 
MensRights,1616881174,again never said that lol idk how u could even get that from what i said
MensRights,1616881137,Are there statistical studies that prove this Not asking out of hostility I ve just never heard of that before But now I have Thanks 
MensRights,1616881112,By every metric men are more often the victims of violence compared to women  Hell DV stats break  down like this     is reciprocal both parties are violent  and    of reciprocal violence is initiated by women     is a woman abusing a man     is a man abusing a woman Even rape statistics  when you include women raping men are gender equal 
MensRights,1616881001,I think that s a big part of it pun intended her lack of penis  So she s being a dick to people that have dicks because she doesn t have a dick   What a twat 
MensRights,1616880976,YES I m so glad you agree on this  That is unbelievably refreshing  I m not sure what exactly I wanted to discuss I think that it s mostly about the male experience as it is obviously foreign to me Or something about specific topics such as the forced suppression of emotions etc due to society s standards of what  makes a man a man   It s mostly out of curiosity I m ignorant about the topic and I just want to learn  amp grow 
MensRights,1616880975,There are all demonstrations of male disposability and gynocentrism  Believe it  Otherwise you will go through the world wonder  Why do these things keep happening  
MensRights,1616880921,Why are you so offended that I do indeed have the right to be able to tell people what they can and can t do with their bodies It is indeed better this way 
MensRights,1616880820,i don t see it as bigotry just like i wouldn t see a group that targets specifically male mental health as bigotry either
MensRights,1616880807,Yes Twitter posts the gender breakdown of their  employees as a requirement of submitting an eeo  report You can find the numbers on Statista   
MensRights,1616880724,Not really  I believe what I believe and don t totally subscribe to either men s right movement or feminist ideas They both have valid points I pick and choose what feels right to me from most viewpoints  Do you Do you agree with any feminist ideas 
MensRights,1616880526,Do you have a source for your stats I know I don t
MensRights,1616880480,What do you mean by this Am I missing something Please educate me 
MensRights,1616880477,Some quick Googling showed me that a man is     x as likely to be homeless as a Fortune    CEO and twice as likely to be homeless as a business owner of any kind YMMV because those numbers fluctuate a bit depending on how exactly they re defined But regardless the point is just what you said  If you roll the dice the average man is more likely to be struggling than he is to be Don Draper 
MensRights,1616880449,Why generalize I just don t want to have an argument over the internet it s exhausting Nobody learns from them it s just further polarizing  amp alienating is it not To me debate has somewhat of a connotation to it I imagine facebook comment sections just tearing into each other only making counterarguments But If it s a respectful debate sure I d love to hear your points But if it s an argument back and forth nobody is growing  I m a fan of seeing others simply as humans with a different take on  reality and thats it I want to humanize people if that makes sense  To achieve societal growth and progress in the realm of equity  amp general peace then we must listen to each other

MensRights,1616880225,You know that would generate a lot of backlash and be a PR nightmare 
MensRights,1616880188,Well yes it appears you do Its been proven repeatedly that women make less because of their own choices and nothing else When an algorithm assigns work with no knowledge of gender men still earn more  about the same gap as the popular wage gap  Uber literally pays men and women the same and assigns work based on an algorithm
MensRights,1616879791,well your language till now has only given off that vibe   no matter what your opinion focus on the way you talk if you don t want to come across as a dick   To you casual sex might be useless but to others it is not women are not hollow sex dolls that are left empty after being pounded we are not fkn objects
MensRights,1616879609,the reason the twitter group is for females is because they make up they are a minority in the tech industry it s not that deep 
MensRights,1616879489,You say you don t want a debate then in saying what you want you describe a good healthy debate I guess you could say that s one of the  myriad things feminism teaches that I have a problem with Debate is about reasoned arguments and argument is about logically supporting a position Neither of these things are negatives yet because they give weight to impartiality feminism gives them a negative connotation because in feminism  partiality is an ethic Feminism corrupts the foundations of everything it touches 
MensRights,1616879470,The pinned post tells men to  Listen to women don t interrupt women repeat   The second says don t buy from straight white men  By advocating buying only from women pocs lgbt etc Other posts link to social justice panels mention gender gap with digs at white men  I admit they try to reign it in a bit but it s definitely prescribes to and espouses misandrist ideology 
MensRights,1616879205,Be honest   you re here to troll aren t you   The constant pushing of everything for women  not even a minority of the population when the same don t exist for men is sexist Its like the United Nations account  as sexist as it gets On international men s day all they could being themselves to tweet was  something about male allies who support women  just insane And of course a UN women account but no account for men 
MensRights,1616879084,It s even worse as a woman because everyone automatically associates me supporting things like the Australian Britney Higgins case with me supporting things like that book It s really difficult to stand up for things that matter when there s stuff like this

MensRights,1616878733,And if there was a  Men of Twitter account all hell would break loose It s telling enough that the perspective of female employees and announcement of pro female gender initiatives is literally marketable while the same for men would be considered unforgivable 
MensRights,1616878706,Since Twitter woman is for women and so then the rest of the Twitter is for men eh boss  
MensRights,1616878435,Insane logic Why would a corporate account have any gendered voice at all Why would it even be representative of employees generally  The main account Is there to make announcements from marketing  mostly female  their managers  mostly female  rubber stamped by the executive  mostly male  In any case    of Twitter employees are female A company is more than it s engineers 
MensRights,1616878013,Satiety is part of the point Satiety decreases hunger Decreased hunger lowers the willpower required to not eat thus increasing success rates If fighting obesity is the goal going for increased success rates is a no brainer CICO isn t incorrect It s just a horribly na ve model which stimulates poor advice lowered success rates and a methodology which most followers don t even strictly follow it anyway Or would you say eating potatoes exclusively is a good way to live

MensRights,1616877954,Yes I think you got it all right I am sorry for confusion but yes for me feminist became insult which is of course incredibly stupid and sad Under term   feminist I imagine a woman that is using feminism as protection from any man or other counter arguements while bringing nothing valid to the table Driven purely by emotions and ideas not based in reality But I to be honest I think this must be caused by environment I grew up that is post communist country At least here in Czech republic from my perspective I do not see any inequality  or I am not at least fed it by media that should or can be eradicated That is why from my point of view feminists have no major reason to fight  I am sorry if I insulted you in any way and I am open to further explanation if required

MensRights,1616890111,All this toxic woke ideology that is sweeping the West  in Oz we are now weathering the biggest shit storm about the treatment of women from within the Parliament and elsewhere promotes many nefarious ideas One of them is to twist and bend and even deny science So instead of honestly encouraging obese people to lose weight because it shortens their lifespan and puts them at higher risk of many diseases including cancer the equity and inclusion ideology trumps science and we end up focusing on feeling good about our bodies no matter how unhealthy that is 
MensRights,1616889844,There is a popular twitter feminist who proudly posted that she recieved and read this book and she also defended Clementine Ford She says she doesn t hate men but I know better

MensRights,1616889427,But in another note if you have any good advice I d love to hear it Despite my firm denial of any allegation of rape and the facts of the matter being in my belief on my side   I am still terrified

MensRights,1616889072,This phrase is from a time when women were housewives and men were doing all the rest Like men were on stage and women were backstage The sentiment of the phrase the way I see it is  the backstage crew is as important as whoever s on the stage   Nowadays of course man and woman are not only interchangeable terms but insufficient and people get mad at semantics instead of looking for meaning Edit  Behind every great success there is great support 
MensRights,1616888986,Because I m ignorant lol That s why I wanted to be educated that s why I made this post   I want to learn and be aware of these things Truly though I think most people don t know about this because the  feminist movement has caused MRA to be silenced in some way At least that s what I ve gathered from users on this subreddit 
MensRights,1616888933,I hate humanity in general for the fact I have to say that women experienced much worse than this smh seriously   I hate that humans just can t be loving and merciful humans and leave it at that
MensRights,1616888836,whoah that s a really interesting article  Do you agree with points that feminists often agree on  As a young woman I have often really feared being alone in public especially at night Many of my male friends do not share this feeling So would you say that s misandry at work  If I understand correctly some points made by feminists have some kind of basis but have been generalized and turned into male hatred Is that how you feel 
MensRights,1616888790,If basedness and stupidity had a human form it would be her
MensRights,1616888682, gt Are there statistical studies that prove this I m more interested to know how you could be so blissfully unaware that boys and men experience more violence 
MensRights,1616888675,how so i am merely stating that yes men get attacked more than females but it is men attacking those men
MensRights,1616888657,We do though  The smart hens in the feminist coup do  I ve been on plenty of  feminist subs and women centric subs where women call other women out   The issue is that its sure as hell not good tv so the good ones don t get listened to If the media just wants to get views so they can get more money from advertising of flap jacking course they re going to be running stories about feminists  even if it s just one and they have a  source that says it s a group belief that little boys should  insert some ridiculous thing or that men should  insert some demeaning thing  And idiot men and idiot women and idiot people all will spew and sneeze their opinions out attract other idiots of like ilk to gladiator battle their beliefs because they would rather die than consider another point of view It s why THIS sub is just    a hub of either really valid points about men s rights issues and    hot gas

MensRights,1616888165,So Are we supposed to just raise the standards because the truth hurts people s feelings 
MensRights,1616887944,I d like to believe most of us do often the issue is that we re blamed for such problems rather than people accepting that they are at a disadvantage and working extra hard to make up for it so their children don t suffer from it they just winge and blame others
MensRights,1616887767,i m very much a woman and i definitely feel scared to go out after dark 
MensRights,1616887669,Tbh I consider myself an egalitarian and only became a mra because of all the hate I recieved from feminist posts I think it s the reason a lot of us are here and some can get a little nasty at times but all we want really is to rebute falsified statistics that try to blame innocent men for peoples failings and to try and express oursleves and talk about our problems without being laughed at
MensRights,1616887664,Why are you not capable of stringing a coherent sentence together I ve still no idea what the fuck it is you re trying to say 
MensRights,1616887412,Then again  men exists with over    k followers while  women is permanently banned so I guess it fine 
MensRights,1616887406,If you claim to care about both sides it would seem insisting on calling that value system  feminism would be incorrect Why is it so important that it have a feminine form Wouldn t a more proper term be egalitarianism

MensRights,1616887147,This is one of the dangers of  education  People getting bits of paper think of themselves as somehow validated by them Their alleged expertise depends on these courses so they will defend that material against all evidence Hence your sister will believe something on her course but not believe it when it comes from an outside source 
MensRights,1616887064,The biggest issue is delusion Feminist ideology  maybe most of it is contradictory and impractical I m not worried though because most women including young women are not feminists   When I share my opinions I feel no fear However I usually keep to myself Not because of fear but indifference I can t recall serious cases of misandry in my life but even if those happened it wouldn t bother me for more than a few seconds I guess the biggest thing was a murky physical interaction with a friend that I have failed to define but would easily define if I were a woman My biggest worry is that feminism and some swathes of the manosphere will just make more and more people lonely sad etc  I have no expectations of an improvement However my mom thinks I m a pessimist so take that with a grain of salt

MensRights,1616886915,Can I add onto this Because I ve noticed something If you pay enough attention  This goes for all  gangs and societies what happened is the Police and the criminals have mutual respect It tends to be more respect if they are part of a group like the Mafia or Hell s Angels Then again they do the bad crimes not the BAD crimes Yes there s a difference
MensRights,1616886857,It should be a felony charge with an equally harsh punishment to what the person she falsely accused would have recieved

MensRights,1616886411,I ll never take ownership for trying to solve the issue because I feel like it s difficult as a woman to do but I would absolutely be willing to help in any way I can The only way I feel like I can help is to listen to all sides of the issue and have conversations to try and help men and women understand each other better   but here goes I live in a small town with one industry Women face a lot of abuse here and there are resources available but it really bugs me that there is little for the men to turn to when they need help What little resources are available the men in the community may not feel comfortable admitting that they need help  For example a man loses his high paying laborious job and ends up at the bar trying to figure out how he will support his family Wife leaves with the kids and he is now in more debt with a spiralling alcohol drug addiction It s a common narrative which also leaves men in this area afraid to be vulnerable or work to make a relationship happen Because of this women blame men for shitty cyclical behaviour and also leaves women afraid to be vulnerable as well  After typing this it s probably a more common narrative everywhere It just really irritates me that the resources are minimal at best I feel like all I can do as a woman is to just show up for those people that call on me for help and I feel really thankful that I ve been able to help my male friends through their depression I also feel thankful that my male friends and I can have these conversations and they can take it back to their place of work for other men I lurk because I care about both sides of the coin Where I feel like we all fail in gender equality is the lack of willingness to communicate and empathize with each other It is a systemic issue What s good for one group is good for the other

MensRights,1616885202,Have you heard any feminist rhetoric It is all us vs them State the exact issues for which you seek opinions 
MensRights,1616884980,I guess I need to elaborate It is social stigma that draws from an ideal of what manhood is This ideal says that men must be always ready for sex at anytime must be stoic and not show emotions They must be independant always in control often in a dominant position in a relationship They must like sports and physical activity and constantly be looking for relationships and power They must also show off that power to others to proove themselves They must remain calm at all times except in some cases where they need to use their anger to protect those they care about  That s a grey area I personally don t understand so the ideal goes  All of this together creates and encourages stereotypes and expectstions that are put onto men which in turn oppresses them

MensRights,1616884303,Idk if ppl r aware but the article appears to be a criticism of the book 
MensRights,1616884303,That s the definition That s about the  th time I have seen a different definition for this term and the how men should behave can be grouped into sexism in general so their is no need for either terms If you were to say women belong in a kitchen it s sexism but if men belong in construction its somehow toxic masculinity Yeah the whole term is a mess and should just be replaced with something that dosent give off such a bad vibe
MensRights,1616884235,Oh the double standards are everywhere If you re a man losing your hair  guys who are will know how painful it can be you will get women be out and out dismissive or even nasty about it  nobody bats an eyelid Those same women will go on about their body positivity stuff or post their  be kind memes I can think of a few short words I could use to describe them and none of them are good One of the things about feminism is that for a lot of women its a very convenient excuse to get ahead and to have complete power E g power of selection politically established in feminism   that guy I dont find attractive is being creepy by showing me interest  for example Women know that they have a lot of things better in life but they ll happily ignore those bits when fighting for their  equality  Now I m not saying there is never a case for women s rights movements because some things women shouldn t have to deal with but modern feminism is toxic and a lot of these women really aren t nice people See that female dating strategy sub for an example   if that were a sub by men about women it would be banned  they re as toxic as its possible to become 
MensRights,1616884091, Treating into each other in debate is quite literally not debate That would at best fall under the  ad hominem attack which is a logical fallacy While moderators of late have failed in this their job in a formal debate is literally to ensure all arguments are based in logic and reason  I understand that Kamala Harris implied that debate is all about destroying you opponent when she explained how she can go from the denigrating Biden in the primaries to being his VP but she s wrong 
MensRights,1616884081,It s not how men behave its a stereotype about how men should behave that s forced onto people I actually would be open to saying that their is also a  toxic femininity  but it would be uncomparable to toxic masculinity because of how different it is 
MensRights,1616884059,That is exactly point of feminism You have an idea that   feminist is a woman Absolutely not true  e g the psychologist Honza Vojtko   a woman driven by emotions It makes us feel degraded to just nonrational beings who aren t capable of rational arguing And to point out some inequality in Czechia  the recent affair when Blatn refused to allow Polish women to get an aborting in CZ changed is view only after the public started complaining  there is much less women in politics       in parliament in       Definitely not the      that we should aim for  Radim Uzel and his influence   Touching women s ass is okay helps with relationships in the working space   Rape has always been here and always will  Stereotypes like  Men are aggressive women should beware them   His interview on DVTV is absolutely terrifying  doctors not allowing women to get sterilezed as  They may change their mind  was discussed in the group I describe lower  body shaming slut shaming virgin shaming  stereotypes of any kind If you want to see my and Czech feminists perspective  not radical no KMA here  you can check  pun not intended out the group Everyday Patriarchy Bullshit on facebook It should be public joining isn t mandatory to see the posts As the name suggests it mainly shows everyday little things that are against equality For non czechs let me describe some of the  recent posts   picture of dirty hands from repairing a car or something and the text  If your man s hand never look like this you re dating a girl   Notice the point of posting this to this group is to mock the picture so it s point is to  fight against the stereotype  men should be dirty else they are not manly enough    picture of some coach in gym women who bend themselves such that their genitals are exposed he touches them  to help  and again joking text  I d looooove to have this job  pictures from language textbook promoting stereotypes  the pic that was also popular on Reddit with Google translate assuming genders for neutral pronouns  a discussion about the information that    of male r pe is caused by another man  the OP is asking for resources for this Resource searching is kinda often in there This is where my journey of a feminist began so that s why I m recommending this to you The group is very welcoming and supports debate so if you want to pose some question there it shouldn t be a problem  Personally I believe that in Czechia women aren t opressed systematically or something There is a lot of sexism coming from older generation  e g our professor telling us that women should not study  my specialization   but we re doing pretty okay Countries like India Poland Sudan and many more African Asian countries need feminism desparately more Also you haven t insulted me it s ok Maybe we well meet again in a discussion at EPB

MensRights,1616883795,You realise the United Nations is an absolutely massive political organisation right When there is sexism against men  and that s what it is when you share tweets like they did on international men s day coming from that level then there s very little anyone here can do besides call it out I know that I and many others did on their account but most guys know right now that men s issues are not considered as important as women s and that men are considered more disposable in the western world  why we will always hear far more about supposed gender pay gaps than male suicide or homelessness rates for example  or just that they could have the gall to make that tweet on the one day meant for men  I think more and men will get angry and point things out but it will take time for anyone to take it seriously such is the level of mainstream misandry Tbh it will come full circle eventually and feminists are acting as their own worst enemies  but again  for now men will continue to be sh t upon

MensRights,1616883403,I can definitely see this Most of my friends are guys and it s a lot more challenging for them to open up My boyfriend took quite a while when he cries I hold him tight like an actually supportive SO So I suppose many women see it from your GFs perspective because he was suprised It still really sucks that you have to bottle it up And her response was pretty fucked IMO  It also really makes it a lot harder to actually seek help if there s something going on  Actually a couple hours I talked to one of my best friends because he seemed  closed off  resistant to emotional vulnerability He opened up finally almost in tears telling me all that s going on in his life In that instant I watched the detrimental effects of the  real men don t cry bullshit unfold  Do you think that men s mental health is often overlooked because of this I thought my friend was just feeling  weird off and I had no idea he was really depressed Also everyone I ve ever personally known who has committed suicide is male I don t think that s a coincidence

MensRights,1616899939,I find it interesting that the ERA is starting to take another run at getting passed  If the ERA passes I can see it benefiting men more than women in those situations where the needle passed  equal long ago For example women would be forced to register for the draft I suspect when the ERA was first attempted it was all about giving women equal opportunity  at least that was the intent   When If it passes this time it will be about not discriminating against men     
MensRights,1616899767,It s not so much being against feminism in its ideal   which is equality   as it is being against misandry which has always been lurking in the background Old ant feminists saw this The next generation got fooled The goal of radical feminism which is now just called feminism has always been to eradicate some imagined wrong and create a world where men are second class citizens No one is fighting for equality anymore They re fighting for superiority now that they have equality Of course they argue that equality hasn t been achieved so they can keep fighting But what they re fighting for now is domination

MensRights,1616897695,Not wanting to engage in a debate is perfectly fine but coming into a men s rights subreddit and making a comment saying  Women have it worse  without elaboration is the kind of thing that invites debate If you re going to express your beliefs in a space that generally disagrees with those beliefs then you should expect people to challenge you I thought that by making your comment you were opening the door to a discussion  gt My only intention by saying nah you re just gonna get off on it it was to say just that Us going back and forth jabbing each other with hyperlinks of data until who s right on who has it worse isn t going to prove or change a damn thing This is reasonable but you expressed it a rude way Saying that you d rather not get into an endless back and forth is something that I would have respected and agreed with being dismissive and making veiled allusions to masturbation is unnecessary However I do appreciate you clarifying what you meant If you d like to simply agree to disagree then I m fine with that  gt And if I wanted to insult you I would have called you an unseasoned chicken breast But I don t And you aren t one Thank you for not calling me an unseasoned chicken breast I don t think you are an unseasoned chicken breast either

MensRights,1616896671,DV  I suggest you read the Overview section of Erin Pizzey s wikipedia page or one of her books  She was the founder of Refuge one of the two organizations in the UK that recently had their funding diverted to nondiscriminatory organizations after decades of sexism   She created the worlds first domestic violence shelters  After opening several for women in the UK she suggested that men could be abused too and men needed a shelter too  She was then slandered her kids were threatened her dog was killed bricks were thrown through her windows and she was from the DV organization she founded  now known as Refuge which has now lost funding decades later   She fled the country for her childrens safety and became an outspoken DV activist and anti feminist once they moved out on their own I wish we as a society look at gender neutral domestic violence data instead of studies looking for violence against women  gt Almost    of all relationships had some violence and half        of those were reciprocally violent In nonreciprocally violent relationships women were the perpetrators in more than    of the cases Src   Behind a paywall I have archived around but Harvard research that women are more likely than men in starting or escalating domestic violence and those women are by far the women most likely to be injured in DV That doesn t say all women injured are perpetrators themselves but it does indicate the problem goes beyond the feminist pop culture model of  violence against women  It includes  gt Almost    of the people surveyed     of women and    of men  said there was some violence in their relationship Women admitted perpetrating more violence     versus     as well as being victimized more by violence     versus     than men did According to both men and women    of this violence was reciprocal that is involved both parties and in those cases the woman was more likely to have been the first to strike Src   or   This is a long meta study that shows we ve known domestic violence isn t gendered for decades   or the whole study here   Popculture article     Most domestic violence research today is research of  violence against women from grants specifically looking for data on violence against women not gender neutral research oncefa has posted lots stuff on this topic with academic references  I think the best two for references are     and This one is interesting because usually as soon as I point out that DV isn t gendered someone explains it is because more women are killed by their partners than men  It wasn t always that way  Women got better options and stopped killing as much   If the goal is to save women s lives rather than demonize men it sure looks like we should be giving men better looking easily available options  But the folks that run DV programs don t want that I also suggest you look into the feminist Duluth Model of Domestic Violence Intervention which results in men being beaten by their wives being arrested more often than the perpetrator when they call the police for help Ellen Pence  The creator herself has written  gt  By determining that the need or desire for power was the motivating force behind battering we created a conceptual framework that in fact did not fit the lived experience of many of the men and women we were working with The DAIP staff      remained undaunted by the difference in our theory and the actual experiences of those we were working with      It was the cases themselves that created the chink in each of our theoretical suits of armor Speaking for myself I found that many of the men I interviewed did not seem to articulate a desire for power over their partner Although I relentlessly took every opportunity to point out to men in the groups that they were so motivated and merely in denial the fact that few men ever articulated such a desire went unnoticed by me and many of my coworkers Eventually we realized that we were finding what we had already predetermined to find  
MensRights,1616896630,Is getting off on something really an insult Is it Is someone saying they don t want to explain their point of view because they made a comment about the role of women throughout history and the perception of women and effects of said perception which has caused the destruction of countless lives is worse than the ramifications patriarchal ideals had on themselves  Really an insult to you  My only intention by saying nah you re just gonna get off on it it was to say just that Us going back and forth jabbing each other with hyperlinks of data until who s right on who has it worse isn t going to  prove or change a damn thing   And if I really thought petty insults were a valid form of argument then I wouldn t have had the decency to say no human being deserves cruelty and I wish we could all just be loving and merciful to each other And if I wanted to insult you I would have called you an unseasoned chicken breast But I don t And you aren t one

MensRights,1616894323,I remember back in     when the Wikipedia edit wars on GamerGate went on It was    Gamers criticize gaming journalists on Twitter reddit    Gaming journalist feminists write inflammatory articles about gamers in response    Feminists edit the Wikipedia article on GG citing the things they wrote in those articles    The Wikipedia turns into a dumpster fire that unironically starts with  The Gamergate controversy concerned an online harassment campaign       Since there are secondary sources calling GG an online harassment campaign of incels Wikipedia sides with them in the end It would be like a scandal occurring within a company and despite the mountains of evidence proving wrongdoing the company making a statement blaming consumers for attitude followed by the company s statement being the only thing reported  I barely visit Wikipedia anymore Whenever they beg for donations I just laugh Adblock on never donate etc 
MensRights,1616894322,I grew up in a home where gender norms didn t exist I raised by a single mom who was a  tom boy  Crying has never been emasculating to me It s just something that happens  Now that I m in digital psychology and neuromarketing with years of study in clinical psychology I can honestly say the problem with men has never been a fear of feeling feminine  If such fear exists then it s not the root cause and can t be fixed by telling them to stop Just like telling a depressed person to stop being depressed won t help them either  It s the fear of negative emotions which is completely common between both genders  In every school of behavioral psychology we learn that the core behavior that continues mental health disorders like depression and anxiety is the evasion of feeling negative emotions  The ability to heal a disorder is directly proportionate to the person s ability to confront painful thoughts and memories  It s not due to some nameless or cureless disease The number of biological causes of depression and anxiety is few and far between They can also be found with a common blood test  Since these two disorders are very common within the female gender we can see it s a prevalent issue for them as well  What causes a lot of confusion is that there are two ways that mental health disorders can be expressed  There is a direct expression and an indirect expression  A direct expression is feeling insecure about your weight and forming an eating disorder  An indirect expression is feeling insecure about your weight and becoming a workaholic in order to achieve success and feel better about yourself  One is seen as a good quality because it can t be directly tied to the person s insecurity and the other can be directly identified as an effect of their insecurity  So men to make up for their lack of comfort with negative emotions tend to armor themselves by denying its existence This causes them to become unfeeling and many times unknowingly depressed  Women don t necessarily deny its existence but they avoid dealing with the issue  I don t want to talk about think about it  This doesn t deny the existence of depression but they re unable to fully deal with it until their painful memories are dealt with  This a very watered down version of the issue It s far more complex than this  Self alienation can cause layer upon layer upon layer of direct or indirect expressions of mental disorders  even mixing them up Said this way the  fear of crying affects both genders equally They re just expressed differently most of the time  Both genders should be acknowledging the importance of facing painful emotions and being completely honest with themselves  It s very tiring to hear this being called a gender specific issue

MensRights,1616892626,See my other comment Saying that Twitter doesn t prevent you is stupid and besides the point since they are only following trends 
MensRights,1616892611,The modern left s goal is the complete eradication of standards and merit where everyone s lifestyle is celebrated no matter how unhealthy and morally wrong it is By thinking that there was a problem with being overweight you were buying into the myth of being fit is healthier By trying to improve yourself you were imposing standards on yourself that made her uncomfortable with her own lack of progress Ultimately the modern left is a movement for people with no desire to better themselves seeking to justify their own laziness Everything is about the abdication of responsibility and placing the blame on people in society who do take personal initiative

MensRights,1616906804,That point of view you have is good but that s not feminism Feminism really isn t against all sexism It still fights for what is  equality  but the view of what equality is shifts a lot A quick google search for the definition of feminism says this  the advocacy of   women s rights  on the basis of the equality of the sexes  You could say you fight for equality  That would encompass being against all sexism  but saying feminism means you will advocate only for women Saying feminism fights against misandry is just the wrong definition 
MensRights,1616906747,This raises an important point that is often overlooked Because of diversity men and women will be on a spectrum of physical characteristics and consequently some will be dismissed from interaction because their characteristics do not match perceived desirable parameters This may be considered reasonable choice and a perfectly natural situation yet it means people are suffering through no fault of their own We take steps to try to give people with a disability a better more equal life yet we ignore those with the disability of not matching desirability expectations Choosing to not interact with a man with a micro penis is not body shaming but personal choice criticising a man for a characteristic outside his control is body shaming The same goes for women Having said that personal choice is influenced by many factors it is not something that is developed in isolation Unfortunately society pays little attention to managing those factors so that we don t influence people to be unnecessarily discriminatory encouraging the twiggy look to be flavour of the month in terms of desirability is just a single example that is destructive We also do nothing to facilitate those who are judged as less desirable to have a similar quality of life as the rest of the population It all seems to be very  survival of the fittest orientated and not   st Century progressive civilisation orientated and it breeds the contempt of  F you Jack I m okay  In the case of micro penis for example we can point out that it doesn t prevent a man from being able to satisfy a woman unless the only way for her to be satisfied is with only a large genuine penis  ever considered a dildo  and a relationship usually consists of more than simply sex  for a woman at least  We don t want to generate pity but the recognition of flexibility and options in the achievement of goals that are more inclusive and not less There has been far too much emphasis in society of only one way to skin a cat and anyone not using that single approach being unworthy of consideration Society needs to recognise that it s goal is to support all of its members to have the best quality of life that is practically achievable  also respecting the environment not the deliberate creation of division between haves and have nots So many women complaining about the lack of  good men and not considering that their standards or expectations may be set unrealistically Society is partly to blame for not encouraging or educating realistic standards and expectations 
MensRights,1616906561,Oppression is a thing The problem is that people believe that only certain groups are oppressed and they are allowed to do anything they want while those that are believed to be the oppressor can do nothing but take it In the past if you believed you were oppressed try and take down your oppressor Your oppressor will then try and beat you back down Thats how it works  Feminisms and a lot of sides but I won t go into it is making people believe that fighting back is bad cause its evil and oppression but they are allowed to do whatever they want to you the one they call oppressor

MensRights,1616906220,Classic feminist bias They really believe that   Only men are bad and   Men are only bad If you ask feminists for examples of behavior that demonstrates  toxic masculinity  they can quickly rattle off a long list But if you ask feminists for examples of positive masculinity they re stumped They can t come up with any description of positive masculinity because they can t imagine that one exists If you try to prompt them by suggesting some traits that are usually considered aspects of positive masculinity such as stoicism being protective of anyone weaker emotional stability self sacrifice for their family etc then feminists will handwave them away by saying  None of those are gendered They re just positive attributes of people in general  Got that Only negative traits are gendered and they re always gendered male Positive traits are either gendered female or are non gendered So goes feminism

MensRights,1616905077,I can sort of see your point that s why I think  blue pill or  gamma is usually a more accurate term for what the person means than  beta    But I think the whole concept of  oppression is just Cultural Marxism  We need to view reality as what it is  You have to make compromises in life and sometimes you get beaten down  Some will call it  oppression and wallow in it Others will try to make the best of their situations

MensRights,1616902762,I see So you are basically saying to not react and to accept what you are or change yourself to be better if you don t like what you are Am I right here And yeah I have been saying on here that we should ignore women s pov of how masculinity or whatever should be They are not men they have no place to say anything The problem is that they can impose that via the state and academia and media onto people and said people will accept it for many reasons like credentials or its accepted by everyone they know so they accept it etc 
MensRights,1616902476,That s not my point at all My point is that women target something that s true in reality and name it something derogatory But just like women bitching about being called a Karen Drawing attention to the fact you feel strongly about it Actually makes it a target It s basically a giant bullseye The fact is men exist on a spectrum How you call it is irrelevant Those lower down will always object  If you really mean what you say that women don t get to define masculinity Then outright ignore the attempt Let it not even register Their opinions are irrelevant  Wear what you are as armour so it can never be used to hurt you  Tyrion

MensRights,1616902070,Sure But why though must women be allowed to determine anything in said hierarchy Said hierarchy is between men not women Just as women say that men have no right to do or say anything about how women act or what they decide to do So should men also not allow women to have any such say in how men act or what they decide to do Otherwise you are basically saying that men must subject themselves to female determination of how men are and should be and that this makes you chad or alpha for doing so

MensRights,1616913409,It s an inappropriate joke I don t think it was her intention to be cruel However it should be noted that Greta Thunberg has sexually harassed ever since she became prominent climate activist and media figure    as an underage teenager   One inappropriate joke is quite the same as years of sexual harassment    
MensRights,1616913286,Forgive me but having had a relative who at the age of   was using live links  telephone era tinder  to seek out men yeah there is a hell of a difference It s an insult to victims who are FORCED TO HAVE SEX AGAINST THEIR WILL that we call statutory  rape  Yes it should be illegal but thinking that agreeing to the seduction efforts of a teenager is at all related to or on par with contravening someone s will NOT to have sex is ridiculous 
MensRights,1616913242,All men are equal All humans are equal The fact that life isn t fair and the ability of individuals or clans  feminism is a clan for that matter to gain control over others does not make any person superior by essence  We are now celebrating the Jewish Passover This day commemorates how slaves became free people under the leadership of a man who could not speak clearly a person who sounded to most as mentally disabled This is taken as a myth but this captures and describes something which is always true  no men or women are superior or inferior by essence They are only oppressed or free The fact that feminism abused the term Oppressed to manipulate democratic societies that are built to be mobilized in support of the oppressed because they were formed in a mass resistance to oppression circa      does not mean oppression does not exist More and more men in Westernized societies and beyond are currently living under oppression systematic and state operated  If those men will be unable to see the feminist and progressivist abuse of the term Oppression and instead believe that the very concept of oppression is false because out of a general political conviction they wish to believe that oppression never existed they will never resist the systematic oppression which would make them part of it You must free yourself  You don t have to join  male feminism for that It s done internally and the motivation for doing it comes from the very same source your rejection of the term Oppression comes from  you are born free you are human But you must acknowledge first that you live under oppression You need to see your chains in order to break them  Acknowledging your oppression does not make you weak and it is never tantamount to an arbitrary acceptance of how feminism has abused this term It likewise is not a contradiction to your self reliance as a man and a human being you are not blaming society for your own incompetence This may happen but you must try to distinguish between blaming society with self victimization which must be avoided and seeing specific rights and freedoms that society systematically infringed you of What determines your self reliance is not whether or not you see your chains but where your hands are when you see them do you carry your shackle or shatter it 
MensRights,1616913145, gt I m sincere I just don t want to have a useless internet argument nobody has time for that shit it s so counterproductive I simply want to hear    in a civil way So why dont you tell me why anyone else here  as well as me you want to hear in a  civil way about men s rights Dont you know if men have rights or not Why do you even need to debate this in any way at all let alone in a civil way      Do you or do you not think men have the same rights as women That just requires a yes or no answer no debate required  The civil debate part happens depending on your answer If it s yes then there s no need for you to have asked for civil discussions at all  gt If you want to move forward with this movement demonizing the  other side is not going to help Really you dont think feminism needs  demonisng  Feminism like this At the root of modern feminism is androcide   Hatred of men is actually brave and courageous and we need to celebrate the women who are willing to openly display their hatred towards men   psychologist feminist  Tracey Brimmer  I feel that  man hating is an honorable and viable political act that the oppressed have a right to class hatred against the class that is oppressing them  Robin Morgan Ms Magazine Editor  I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high heel shoved in his mouth like an apple in the mouth of a pig  Andrea Dworkin feminist  Since marriage constitutes slavery for women it is clear that the women s movement must concentrate on attacking this institution Freedom for women cannot be won without the abolition of marriage  Sheila Cronin the leader of the feminist organization NOW  Marriage as an institution developed from rape as a practice  Andrea Dworkin  The institution of sexual intercourse is anti feminist  Ti Grace Atkinson feminist  Rape is nothing more or less than a   conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear     Susan Brownmiller Against Our Will p    The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately    of the human race  Sally Miller Gearhart in The Future  If There Is One  Is Female  And if the professional rapist is to be separated from the average dominant heterosexual  male  it may be mainly a quantitative difference  Susan Griffin Rape The All American Crime  If life is to survive on this planet there must be a decontamination of the Earth I think this will be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males  Mary Daly Feminist  Men who are unjustly accused of rape can sometimes gain from the experience  Catherine Comins feminist  I believe that women have a capacity for understanding and compassion which man structurally does not have does not have it because he cannot have it He s just incapable of it  Barbara Jordan former Congresswoman  Women have their faults  men have only two  everything they say  everything they do  Popular Feminist Graffiti So  why dont you start off the civil discussion you want to have by telling me in a civil way why I or any other man on this planet shouldn t demonise feminism and everyone who choose to call themselves feminist especially in r mens rights  One of the reasons for the failure of feminism to dislodge deeply held perceptions of male and female behaviour was its insistence that women were victims and men powerful patriarchs which made a travesty of ordinary people s experience of the mutual interdependence of men and women    Rosalind Coward 
MensRights,1616912514,Strictly speaking about animal kingdom there are so many species that compete within their tribes to accumulate wealth and or power There definitely are alphas and they tend to have advantage in dining or mating first or most This is very common in apes and also within mankind  unfortunately  The moment we humans found surplus some alphas started hoarding to protect themselves and their tribe against threats This isn t or it shouldn t be as much needed nowadays as we humans are already very safe if we agreed on common rules Still it might be coded to our genes at this point to still hoard more until others have nothing left There are still  alphas and  betas but the difference is negligible really and it has become more about who has and who doesn t even if those roles wouldn t be needed It s simply a relic from the past that has become a curse and it often ends up in great violence at some point

MensRights,1616911664,My two cents Children often act out when deeply upset with the parent they actually trust His mother is so unreliable and her partners leave so frequently Instinctively he doesn t feel safe there He feels safe with you he acts this way because he knows you ll stick THIS IS A GOOD THING Work through it together be a team This is when you get a chance to shine man Get some male therapists help with tactics and evaluation But make it through together 
MensRights,1616911636,I m not sure I agree As a society we should   make  this rape  I m not sure the provable elements would meet the current legal definition but we make up that definition  but if you reverse the genders I don t think it needs to be rape Why the apparent double standard Simple because the status quo overpenalizes individuals who happen to be male for engaging in male behavior I strongly believe that sex criminals should be equally male and female because  heterosexual sex itself requires both a male and female partner Our society should strive to create a system where participation in an activity necessary for the continuation of life does not engender a greater risk of imprisonment for anyone because of their gender Otherwise we are not receiving equal burden of law nor equal protection of law as potential victims But perhaps it is simply not possible to make gender neutral rape laws unless we grade on a curve Put differently part of what makes the ex in this story a good candidate for penalization is the fact that this this accusation is beyond the pale coming from a male victim talking about a female alleged perpetrator    out of      women will never be accused of doing anything like this   Males not so much There are plenty of males being nominated as potential sex criminals We could be more selective about who we choose to make into an example   Currently If this changes the law should change accordingly 
MensRights,1616911589,Partly also because it s good for the narrative if they EVER admit that men have it worse in some area it may divert attention and resources from them This shows up clearly in their belief in things that are provably untrue like  Women s health is neglected when all the evidence is the reverse but it must be  true otherwise how can they keep getting more and more resources for women s health 
MensRights,1616911538, Stoltenburg said he believed that Krueger was manipulated to a certain extent by her husband Dexter and that he was more culpable in the abuse  Yeah because women just  can t be bad in and of themselves They have to be manipulated by some evil man in order to do bad things  s

MensRights,1616925557, Exactly Like you said there should be a platform to discuss men s issues but sadly this ain t it Most of the people aren t only interested in bashing radical feminists but to use any information to validate their hatred for women as a whole Sadly you see a lot more of the  see this is why women are evil stupid weak as opposed to more rational lines of reasoning  This is furthered when you see that anyone who engages in critical discussion is shot down immediately with anger and aggression They are only interested in validating their inherent misogyny and have no time for critical thinking 
MensRights,1616925437,She only ended up getting sentenced for  of her  charges  gt In exchange for the plea the remaining charges in the six count indictment alleging rape and aggravated incest were dismissed No other charges will be brought against Krueger 
MensRights,1616925363,This but due to legal reasons for many places As many legal systems refer to the presence use of a penis in order to classify and distinguish rape from sexual assault  or whatever local terminology is used  publishers cannot legally state otherwise without opening themselves up to libel suits as the law doesn t confirm any such statements It s extremely inconsistent especially for so many places touting  equality across the boards but unfortunately how things are 
MensRights,1616925357,She was only sentenced this long because of the victims age and because she is ugly 
MensRights,1616925352,Yet noone has the power to fire the principal even when she did wrong

MensRights,1616924936,I completely agree I only came across this subreddit by accident and thought for sure it couldn t be as bad as it looked Unfortunately it just seems to be a group of men who thrive off asserting each other s beliefs that they they are oppressed and anyone who thinks otherwise is a misandrist It s just a cry for attention Whenever any social movement pops up there are always people who feel offended it isn t about them It s the same reason the  all lives matter movement exists They would be much better off addressing actual issues as I assume this subreddit was intended to do Unfortunately from looking through the posts it s mostly about bashing clearly rare radical feminists who represent the movement no more than an otter does 
MensRights,1616924927,Theyll say it s bad because of racism and because black people are oppressed White men according to them aren t so it s not as bad
MensRights,1616924795,How about both just learn to understand each other rather than either one or the other fundamentally change 
MensRights,1616924440,Ah but see that would be expecting reason and logic on this sub Sadly you set your standards too high These people are incapable of thinking rationally on this subject because they aren t led by the information rather they are led by hatred and seek the information to validate that Very much led by their emotions which is ironic considering that s a frequent put down they use about women  Although what cracks me up is the fact that they seem  so surprised that suicide rates are higher than homicide rates as male perpetrators That suggests  that they have lower expectations of men than the average person Which perhaps gives some insight behind their attitudes self hatred and projection 
MensRights,1616924365,I can t tell if you re being sarcastic or not but in case not no men generally  at least in my experience as one working in heavy industry do not talk about such things and in the cases where one of the boys  there is a distinction being made in my language here brings something like this up the men will generally tell him to grow up get on with it and not be so shallow though not in so many words If an online male space  were such a thing allowed to exist have a similar but gender flipped conversation you can be assured that space would be    d in very short order   
MensRights,1616923792,I like it  Calling it  the source of envy is a little to on the nose 
MensRights,1616923710,OK so women can t be charged with rape except as a party of commission but in the scenario above she would be charged with  causing sexual activity without consent and as the situation caused the victim s penis to penetrate a vagina the perpetrator would be liable on conviction to a sentence of life in prison Whether the police would do anything in response to such a report is a universal question in every country missandry and gynocentrism are not unique to the UK

MensRights,1616923255,I believe all people are equal if you think that s misandrist then that s on you I m sorry you feel the need to make every social movement about yourself  perhaps it is because you do not feel represented and that is a horrible feeling I know  As much as it is hard to imagine in this day and age women are repeatedly blamed for their own assaults and murders Just look in one comment section of a true crime drama or even on this very subreddit I m sure And even if it doesn t happen today it has still happened in the past and lingers on people s minds  I explained my points clearly and politely I never once insinuated that you were in the wrong yet you chose to attack me That is not the proper way to win an argument Women have a right to be scared of men And men have a right to be scared of women Women just don t get so uptight about it I think the fact that the subreddit  feminism has less members than this one shows its not as big a problem as you think I will never knowingly group a people together and state they are all the same That s simply not true Everyone has their own thoughts and beliefs I emolore you to do the same Not every women trying earnestly to get their point across wants to degrade men  There are many men issues that need addressing Single fathers being outcast male nurses being mocked Unfortunately however a lot of angry people on the internet spend more time attacking the reladicals of what they perceive to be  all feminists  who are in fact just like men who commit crimes against women the minioity than doing anything about it Please can you re read my arguments again after calming down I know when people are upset it s easy to read things in a nasty or condescending tone  I just want you to assess my point critically before giving in to your want to defend yourself If  not all men is true which it is then you have nothing to defend against There is no need to get defensive as you clearly did in the last sentance of your last comment 
MensRights,1616923069, gt Why are the expectations for men  from women primarily  Because women control sexual reproduction A perfect example of this is   Note that this was before women got the vote and the leading suffragettes were involved in starting it It shows that women always had social power and always used it to shame men into doing the dull dirty and dangerous work by using the threat of reproductive exclusion Likewise it was women that drove the prohibition movement in the     s   using the exact same mechanism albeight this time even more explicitly  amp  x   B The same dynamic is at work today for example if a man speaks about  his experience with a violent female partner   or when women  outright celebrate and glorify such violence    amp  x   B  gt those in power are the ones that set the expectations for society right Depends on how you define  power  As described above women have always had the social power to shame men into compliance by shaming them as being  not real men and thus not eligable for reproduction This pattern is in active use today throughout the feminist movement to shut down men and gain the upper hand for example  Australian Senator uses  mansplaining to shame male politician   Accusations such as  male fragility   male privilege   muh historical oppression etc pp are direct decendants of this modus operandi   amp  x   B  gt that s why conservatively minded stubborn people have trouble accepting new ideas Nice conservative shaming you snuck in there The fact that change is not always and automatically for the better but that things can actually get worse and then might be anywhere from difficult to impossible to fix is conveniently absent from your analysis Conservatives know this and therefore opt to proceed with caution  amp  x   B  gt And again feminism is a very broad and muddy term Again this is no coincidence since it allows feminists to use hyperaggressive tactics and then hide behind the dictionary definition For example the genocidal feminism that runs all the way from radical  nd wave feminism  Andrea Dworkin Sally Miller Gearhardt etc right down to todays  Men are obsolete   The future is female etc When a man correctly calls out this genocidal hate movement for what it is the respective feminist will drop back to  but feminism is about equality   How dare you be against equality   lt insert standard man shaming as per above here gt  It is exactly this  agress and cloak dynamic I spotted and called out in your post above

Scotsman especially when moderates of feminism allow the radicals to run the show with nary an action and barely a word to stop them It was feminists that protested men s summits to discuss men s issues like mental health and plummeting school performance The nonsense in Toronto comes to mind The only people to condemn it in any reasonable number are MRAs and egalitarians It s feminists that have prevented Great Britain from recognizing men being victims of raoe By their definition in law  men can not be raped by a woman  Feminists have opposed a gender neutral draft every time the issue is raised It s feminists that pushed the asinine Duluth model which by it s very existence is an insult to the idea of equality before the law It is a law enforcement model that always treats the man in a situation as the suspect Nevermind the idiocy of using that in a same sex couple situation it s been used to ignore male victims and enable their abusers   It s feminists that try to not only maintain the absurd double standards in the judicial systems of the world but also to  widen them  It s no secret that  men go to prison women go to therapy  Assuming a woman even gets a sentence she will serve a significantly reduced sentence compared to a male counterpart for identical crimes This is pushed by feminists and I see none of them calling this out in large numbers or in any numbers really They don t care they like this status quo     On top of this their efforts have gone to prevent and shut down men s shelters Male victims have no where to go and often end up homeless or with substance abuse problems   Then you have real winners like Mary Koss who is responsible for trying to bury facts about male victims This isn t some nobody loudmouth she is a influential feminist responsible for leading CDC studies and is part of their think tank She has gone on record saying men and boys can not be raped Here this link is long but I suggest you read the whole thing The guy that wrote it is a much better writer than I   Don t get me wrong there are a handful of feminists still around I can respect Christina Hoff Summers still calls herself a feminist for reasons that are beyond my comprehension since she is basically a pariah now for sticking up for men and rejecting inter sectional feminism as the sectarianism that it is There is a reason she is called  based mom and when she talks she has my undivided attention something I can not say of many others feminist or otherwise  amp  x   B  gt For me feminism is about equality of all sexes and genders  Then you re not a feminist you re an egalitarian A lot of feminists will regurgitate the trite dictionary definition to deflect criticism Specifically  gt Belief in or advocacy of women s social political and economic rights especially with regard to equality of the sexes  The focus is one women and it s done exclusively so So by both definition and deed feminists do not stand for men we are a litmus for feminists to use to measure their own standing against Not even all men either just the most affluent or well off ones This is called Apex Fallacy Where you only use the top examples of something How often do you hear other feminists whining about  lack of women in CEO positions even though to      of men those positions are equally as unattainable Yet you never hear for a big push to put women into equal blue collar positions They exist in these positions but if you walk onto a construction site odds are the woman is a college educated contractor or MBA type not a rank and file worker It s like spotting a rare white elk if they re actually getting down and dirty   gt But everyone sees feminism differently  You re right For instance I see it as an ingrained and institutional power that acts like it s still the underdog fighting  the man or  the establishment or that ever present and all powerful  patriarchy  I see any and all good intentions that was once part of the movement has been warped and shaped into a hammer with which to beat people down Not least of all because of things like this   Read it One of my favorites is the bit about feminists harassing the woman Erin Pizzy that established shelters for women for the crime of going against the narrative established about domestic violence They threatened her stalked her smeared her because she dared suggest that domestic violence is not one sided Or how Canadian Feminists harassed the founder of the ONLY male shelter and had the government run interference in denying him funding until he was driven to suicide These are just drops in the ocean and doesn t even begin to cover how they screw over men in the cases of sexual assault rape and false accusations There s a lot more in this collection of incidents and black marks There s bad apples and extremists in any group sure but they sure seem to be common in feminism and the moderate sit by and only offer  but it s not TRUE feminism because feminism is X Y and Z as a way to make it look like they care In effect it stops nothing and the  extremists get to run the show It s a tidy little arrangement  If this was actually a handful of bad apples I d even agree with you that it s only  some but this is well and beyond  some  Even if numerically the majority of feminists were decent people the policy makers and influential members are complete nutcases more interested in protecting the power they have amassed or keeping revenge based IDPOL going than they are in actual equality I called myself one a long time ago and when I needed them most they hung me out to dry Repeatedly They re not interested in helping men and for all the talk of equality they really don t give a shit about equality if it s not about women Fact is you can t help one reach equality if you ignore or worsen the other

MensRights,1616935377,I literally told her  how is something that one sex is forced to do not sexist what If I said woman are now forced to become cooks and she laughed and walked away
MensRights,1616935355,Speaking of female mra s Sydney Watson is a great YouTuber who is completely unbiased when representing data reviewing articles etc To get an idea of the mrm you should give her a watch she s the only person feminists tend to leave alone as she is woman and criticising her would go against their ideas they do quite often call her a  pick me girl  
MensRights,1616935329,And Americans are sitting at home wondering if we are fucked xD
MensRights,1616935305,The malala fund has done excellent work in Pakistan regarding female education and they have not been shy about being self proclaimed feminists while being named after one of the most famous feminists    Seems pretty positive to me 
MensRights,1616935270,EXACTLY bro at some point I said I don t want to bother with that shit anymore  The issue is the same that I already mentioned a few radicals destroy the reputation of the group Incels are woman hating virgins Feminists are men hating screeching idiots Antifa are violent facists BLM are city destroying terrorists
MensRights,1616935268,Look  western society more or less revolves around convenience Since accepting that you are obese goes out of your comfort zone the best way to counter is to not talk about it or simply glamorize it It s more of a culture of convenience than accepting the harsh truth that you are obese 
MensRights,1616935192,Nah she had nothing black and white words it is sexism because mandatory for men not women But in new leftist terms sexism is when you have more men doing something than women even if it s a forced action most women wouldn t accept anyways 
MensRights,1616935168,You know I ve had some conversations with people from or originally from outside the US and Europe Many of them say that actually following the same logic of feminists men are  oppressed or at the very least have less rights  as weird as that my seem initially  and I am starting to agree with them to some extent Not saying all men and women are the same just in general Keep in mind this is context country dependant For example  briefly  women really have a higher degree of control in relationships and in families  even though they don t look it or act like it is not the case  They are entitled to their man s income but not the other way around Generally speaking for marriage the male has to have his shit together while the female has to just accept Some women say  I m just as girl and get away with a lot of shit where males are expected to  man up  The list goes on but I hope you got the point 
MensRights,1616934930,I dont understand the hatred for incels  maybe I misunderstood but from what I gather an incel is someone who doesn t wanna deal with shit anymore they have been rejected so many times and often times in disgusting ways that they are so hurt and tired they just don t care anymore    in movies if you saw that guy and fucked with him you would be the bad guy people in the audience would say  ugh what kinda dick character picking on the sad man but in real life you are cool to laugh at sad people That seems fucked up to me 
MensRights,1616934612,And to think some women want to do away with prison for women all together
MensRights,1616934541,I wouldn t say feminism most of the work is done by NGOs Most people here don t even know that a word like  feminism even exists The credit should go towards NGOs and not feminism Yes I am glad that a lot of young girls in Pakistan are getting an education Education is really important and a lot of people especially from poor households still believe that men work and women shouldn t so educating them is pointless But that needs to change But thankfully more educated people know that education is important regardless of gender

MensRights,1616934093,Also to add to that this is true for most poor countries regardless of a person living in their own country or first world country Let me give you an example of freelancing because I have experience in that Most freelancers from Pakistan  and other third world countries would agree to work for you even for a fraction of a cost It is because it s hard to get a job so people become freelancers instead and just to get work they would agree to work with you regardless of cost Also even if   or    won t sound a lot for you you it will be a lot for most of us  If you have ever used a freelance platform like Fiverr before I m sure you ve noticed how low the prices are from people in third world country compared to others 
MensRights,1616933956,so what that just goes to show how how bad society is to women for women to kill themselves so much  amp  x   B owait men kill themselves    times more than women nvm
MensRights,1616933776,We re not at that point yet over here But there are a few similar recent instances and all the stuff going in on the internet and in some places in he world regarding males just being inherently bad and a threat to women The sad thing is some men are jumping on the bandwagon 
MensRights,1616933732,Less than half of the females in Pakistan are literate whereas   percent of men are literate Many sources suggest the overall illiteracy rates in Pakistan are increasing despite a global decrease overall  One of the ways feminism has made real change in societies is by vastly improving education for women Do you feel this is an initiative that lacked foresight or are you supportive of improving access to education for young women in Pakistan that are clearly lagging behind their male peers 
MensRights,1616933593,Yes I am aware of that I think I heard something like this from someone from the USA too where big companies prefer hiring Mexicans because they will agree to work on really low wages  I forgot what I read exactly but I think it was something similar to that  I think because of situations like these actual citizens don t get many job opportunities even in low wage sectors 
MensRights,1616933589,I think dads would find it amazing and every mother would benefit from it I imagine giving birth and caring for a  your first newborn child can be very exhausting It would be great for both genders if dads had some  extra time off to support their wives and children

MensRights,1616933441,Oh so you are one of those who says that  feminism is about equality lol It s just not You don t know why I am pissed over feminism No it s not just because  some feminists seems to want to overpower men it s not that simple You are doing a strawman Where did I said that the problem was solely on the fact that this account was only for women  Because I didn t In fact it s not even a problem in itself it s a symptom If there s no TwitterMen account it s because Twitter as a company is just following trends this account is just for PR If they didn t made a TwitterMen account it s because they know they would receive a lot of backlash and they don t want to face it Hence why people are angry at that It s just showing how men are perceived in society we can t have support Fighting  for equality for women  Don t you think it doesn t make any sense lmao Equality is between  things at minimum but you purposefully said  equality for women  why not  equality between women and men  I know that there are aspects where men are more in power and vice versa and I absolutely agree I m an egalitarian I thrive for equality for all humans but you don t even ask yourself why I m that mad over feminism  well you don t because you made up some reasons  why would feminism have the exclusivity of  equality anyway  The thing that convinced me that feminism is absolutely not about equality is this scene in The Red Pill   I considered myself a feminist when I first saw this movie but to me it wasn t making sense that those people were protesting at some men talking about the issues they were facing and calling them names There s even a woman saying that she would like to have both men and women talking about their issues yet she s protesting against them    So maybe you are being honest you really think feminism is about equality and all but it s really not You can t be about equality when you shutdown any people who wants to speak about problems you don t get You have to at least let them speak understand what they are talking about and then get angry if there s something to be angry about but just shutting down people before or when they speak just shows that you are afraid of what they might say If you are honest if you really thrive for equality in society please dig deeper into the subject give more attention to problems men are facing at least as much as women s and you will reach the same conclusion as me  feminism ain t about equality just be an egalitarian Btw the point your made about the tirade isn t pertinent I was talking about the content  yk the things I wrote between

MensRights,1616933246,Ok thank you very much for the info One more question if you don t mind Can you see acknowledge the destabilizing effect that pakistani immigration has on the host countries Specifically competion in low wage sectors and resulting wage suppression for the poorer and more disadvantaged members of the host societies while benefiting the rich people in the host countries

MensRights,1616933047,Tell that to mainstream media and the government The so called  loudest run modern society either directly through positions of power and influence or indirectly through dissemination of information through social media and the like It s more common for  feminists to rally public support against a man than to help them So I m sorry    but your statement is a pretty idealistic and unrealistic standpoint 
MensRights,1616932981,What is difference between sexual assault and rape I never understood it
MensRights,1616932912,You re not wrong Unfortunately a lot of men  husbands fathers do that But it s more common among people from villages and people with no  or some education even in cities or from poor families Yes women are looked down upon if they are not covering themselves But a lot of people don t beat them especially if they are not from your family They usually get advice from their parents to do that Also most people who look down upon women who don t cover their bodies are other women 
MensRights,1616932723,could you elaborate I don t understand I would genuinely like to do so Thanks    
MensRights,1616932698,Yeah and in a few more years they ll do away with  over weight like they did with  pre hypertension 
MensRights,1616932601,Moreover a waist measurement of over   inches for women and   inches for men may also indicate obesity   
MensRights,1616932565,Yes polygamous marriages are allowed but they are not as common  husbands or wives are allowed per person A man can marry all  at the same time but a woman can t marry another before divorcing the first The most common I ve seen is a man having  wives but it s still not that common Most people prefer monogamous marriages The divorce rate is not very common among marriages but arranged marriages are more common 
MensRights,1616932471, gt Most women follow it not because of oppression or anything but because they respect their religion No offence but I really don t believe this to be the case They follow it in fear of oppression from their husbands their father and just society s etc in general Can you really tell me with utmost certainty that they wouldn t be heavily looked down upon and even beaten of they don t follow these things of their own will

MensRights,1616932190,Thanks for your swift and detailed reply May I ask how common polygamous marriages  one men several wifes are in Pakistan as per your experience impression I d suppose that this would further aggravate the situation of young men who not only have bad economic prospects  due to high birth rates but also are further challenged to find a wife because more economicly successful men take several wifes and thus reduce the number of women available for marriage

MensRights,1616931445,Now dude you are just being stupid Having Twitter making an official account and having someone else making an unofficial one isn t the same period It s not that serious  It actually is It s just another symptom of how men are perceived in society that s why people here are kinda angry about that Simple as that 
MensRights,1616931441, gt I know this isn t really a men s rights issue This is about as core a men s issue as it gets That being said this place is not exactly ideal for working on such sensitive issues Due to the hands off moderation policy it can be a bit crude and combative at times and psychological expertise  which is what you need I think is pretty rare around here There s a community that might be of better help than this forum   This was founded by two psychologists who are quite critical of the feminist bent that psychology has taken in the recent decades Therefore they built this community for men to share their problems and be communal and helping each other Also Tom Golden  who is a psychotherapist who specializes in men s issues and is a co founder of the aforementioned community has a website where you can contact him   I think these spaces might be better suited at providing you with what you re looking for both in terms of psychological expertise to inform your support for your son as well as with respect to giving you a support group of guys and dads to discuss your issues I can t promise you anything but I hope it helps 
MensRights,1616931421,Let me guess you re very young There s no way you can believe women don t have problems of their own I suppose you also think racism isn t real or it affects white people worse Women are    of rape victims and that s only the reported ones They have to be far more wary than men while walking home at night because of this They re also the majority of domestic abuse victims Women are under more pressure to look nice get laughed if they don t and get gawked at and potentially groped in the street if they do Their natural physical inferiority to men leaves them far more vulnerable to violence Women experience general sexism all the time just look at in video game chats when someone hears a female voice or when a YouTube comment has a woman in their profile picture That s a problem ingrained in society Talking about suicides homelessness and homicides are massive issues but they only affect a small percentage of the male population The majority of the things I listed affect almost all women Maybe it s best to realise that every group has issues no matter how privileged you perceive them to be
MensRights,1616931172,There s a YouTuber called Joel Haver who I ve noticed paints his nails It looks pretty cool actually 
MensRights,1616931156,Unlike in western countries our culture is completely opposite and also extremely conservative As it is a Muslim country we have a lot of restrictions and strictly follow them Some of the examples are   In western countries it is believed that women should wear whatever they want But in Muslim countries like mine women are supposed to cover their bodies Most women follow it not because of oppression or anything but because they respect their religion   Same with sex Sex before marriage is forbidden and most men and women will strictly follow it too So it will be extremely rare to find pregnancy in women before marriage So you wouldn t find anything promotions like birth control or stuff like that What I gathered from western countries about  My body my choice is that it is usually based on these two things So promoting something like that here would be pointless Sure this type of thinking might be good in western countries where premarital sex is common and all that stuff But promoting something where they don t have this type of culture is pointless in my opinion 
MensRights,1616930944,Your presentation seem to be taken the  Petition about wanting to ban men from driving as if it s serious and not a facetious remark about the asinine nature of the argument that girls showing shoulders at school is somehow sexual

MensRights,1616930630,Yes you are right about this Especially poor people here have a mindset that more kids equals more money So they keep having kids I m from a middle class family but even we have at least  kids siblings per household But even in middle class families people had a lot of kids during my parent s era For example my mom has  siblings and my dad has   You re also right about the wages Pakistan is one of the countries with the lowest wages That s why most prefer going abroad to countries like the USA Canada Australia etc for better opportunities We don t have a concept of hourly wages only monthly salary But even people with Bachelors degrees can t earn enough The starting salary of an engineer with a Bachelor s degree is somewhere between       to       rupees        to     USD per month It increases of course based on experience Feel free to ask me anything you like I will gladly answer you

MensRights,1616929974,I think something similar happened I can t confirm the source because I ve only heard from multiple people here but I think some kind of NGO hired those women from another country At least that s what I heard I can agree with them because their Urdu  our native language was not even that good They were trying to promote things that Pakistani women had for decades now For example rights to vote owning property and cars having high rankings in offices etc Women can literally do whatever men can do in Pakistan If you spend even a few minutes googling that you can find all these things Pakistan is mainly a Muslim country The women who wear a burka  headscarf don t do it because they are pressed they do it because it s part of their religion These feminists were trying to promote the  My body my choice agenda here too It was hated by most women here not just men Women were even making fun of that statement lol That s why I think the women who were trying to promote feminism didn t do any research regardless of where they were from

MensRights,1616929694,I m not very informed on Pakistan to be honest Only thing I know is that you have a pretty high birth rate    births      inhabitants as per UN data  and in combination with rising live expectancy that creates a very young population which brings predictable problems with respect to social stability If there are a lot of young people in a country they want need economic opportunities to make a living for themselves  and their future families  It has often been observed that the economies of countries with very high birth rates can t keep up with the population growth which leads to wage stagnation or even wage decrease for everyone due to an oversupply of workers This in turn leads to many young people not having good prospects for the future which leads to economic and social unrest Would be genuinely interested in your perspective on this 
MensRights,1616929351,Ok I understand that better I was looking at Tori U specifically and I m happy that she cares about the males in her life  So I think it s because in the broader picture feminism has turned more into an anti male concept that normalize male hate language So someone who supports feminism is unable to simultaneously support men s rights unless they are willing to criticize and fight against what is currently happening with feminism 
MensRights,1616929159,Not enough information Did they discuss using another person s egg Using a surrogate Adopting  None of that is stated Personally I feel sorry for her and him too If he gets into a less than ideal relationship he may stay just because the lady is fertile 
MensRights,1616929145, gt The summary of this post is that they don t research the culture of a certain country they just want to promote their agenda no matter where in the world they are In my experience it s not really actual feminists that do this and rather menhaters on platforms like Twitter that use the movement as a guide to further their own bullshit propaganda It s ridiculous

MensRights,1616946486,Out of curiosity did you  really expect the statistics to be the reverse I m really bemused that so many on here appear surprised that suicide figures in countries such as the UK and Canada exceed homicide figures How many people do you know who have committed   attempted to commit suicide or knows someone who has committed attempted to commit suicide How many do you know who has been the victim of murder attempted murder I know of a fair few across a number of social groups It s not uncommon to know someone who has committed suicide but it is extremely rare to know someone who was murdered I genuinely don t see why you guys are surprised by this stat And considering the sub this is  this makes it even more bemusing I think even on the feminism sub this wouldn t be something novel or offer new insight it s kinda stating the obvious And yet this is a men s rights sub and you are all so surprised by this It s really bizarre to compare figures of suicide versus figures of homicide I mean more women die of cancer than murder so what Dying of a mental or physical illness should not be compared with being murdered it s wholly irrational 
MensRights,1616946127,You can definitely train your mind if you re aware of this bias though Problem is that it s taboo to talk about this subject and everyone who tries to do so is met with scrutiny by both genders  My advice would be offer the men in your life the same favors and kindness you would offer a woman When a man is talking about his pain bear in mind that you might actually be the only person who is willing to hear When a man is talking about his problems don t try to gaslight him and blame him for all of his problems because yes guys do that all the time with one another when a woman talks about her problems it s society s fault for sucking never her own But as soon as a man talks other people will say his problems are all on his mind that it s mostly insecurity etc

MensRights,1616945358,did the woman get charged with something or is she seeking out another victim 
MensRights,1616944887,Just like  Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo   The Prosecution originally believed she had been  manipulated by him to help commit the murders so they cut a deal for her to testify  Then the video eveidence surfaced and they realized she was a willing participant  She   got   years 
MensRights,1616944886,Gynocentrism is simply hardwired in human DNA It s impossible in to  fix it within a generation or two unless you go around producing genetically modified humans  The only thing you can do is educate people about this but as soon as you try that you ll be branded as misogynist incel and thrown in jail I guess the best approach is educating young boys about this from an early age 
MensRights,1616944845,We are fighting for gender equality too   Gender equality is not  off topic    It is the core essence of MRA  This was supposed to be the job of  gender equality movement when it first started But they neglected men s rights That s why we fight for it

MensRights,1616943810,Yes you are right No offense taken Due to the unwillingness and incapability of the government people go to the countries where they can find opportunities without knowing what it could do to that country as you mentioned The government here is really corrupt who don t take care of people at all and only care about money About the cultural sensibility you don t have to care at all But in my opinion it can help your cause a lot For example there are multiple NGOs and some feminist organizations that help people a lot But they understand what Pakistan lacks that s why they are successful in their cause But I think you re comparing a really big problem  the effect of your economy due to immigrants with a really minor one  lacking the cultural knowledge  I think that s why you think cultural sensibility is a minor problem to care about which is true But as I mentioned above having some knowledge about culture can help your cause a lot 
MensRights,1616943783,Thank you for correcting me I ve heard similar things too It is true that a lot of mothers scare their daughters like this but a lot of women do it out of respect for the religion too In my opinion mothers shouldn t scare their daughters like that and yes you re right it can be creepy too I appreciate you sharing your perspective too

MensRights,1616943535,Men forced to do something against their will women allowed to make the choice for themselves Not sexism Men and women each given a choice in what they want to do and more men choose to do something than women Sexism Modern gender politics sure are fun I ll never get over how misogynistic feminists can be They see fewer women in STEM so they push for more advantages for women So now we have all manner of female only scholarships to push more women into STEM and women get crazy advantages in the hiring process due to everyone racing to fill gender quotas But even so there are  still fewer women in STEM To a rational person the obvious explanation is that women simply don t want to work in STEM fields as much as men do But feminists absolutely  must blame everything on misogyny so they continue to conclude that fewer women in STEM means misogyny The irony here is that by concluding that they are denying that women are simply using their choice So feminists are denying that women have free will and agency Pretty misogynistic don t you think 
MensRights,1616943315,To add onto what the other guy said a large part of the problem is that  incel has joined  nazi   fascist  and  racist in the camp of words which don t mean anything anymore They ve been overused Anyone who disagrees with a black person on anything gets called racist Anyone who disagrees with a leftist on anything gets called a fascist nazi And people get called incel for   basically anything So it kind of means nothing anymore The other guy was right about the original definition And you are right that with the original definition it would be ridiculous to hate such a group It would essentially be virgin shaming But the problem is like the other guy said a loud minority have become twisted and hateful leading to  incel becoming an attack word And once it became an attack word it started to lose meaning because you can just throw an opinion out and if people disagree they might call you an incel despite that having nothing to do with your sex life 
MensRights,1616943183,Hey so as a Pakistani woman I think your first point is somewhat wrong Yes a lot of women do wear hijab by choice but there are a lot of women who are told from a young age as well how women who don t cover up and wear shirts pants casual attire mostly are sluts or attention seekers Some women are told to cover up even in their own house around cousins and in some cases family even like It s seriously creepy being told that you need to cover up in your own house around a   year old something married man who s your relative When I was around   I had short hair which I kept untied no Biggie right  My mom would disagree she loved to tell me how it looks weird and cheap and only  cheap western women do it yeah also how I d burn in hell for it By the way She s educated used to teach and comes from a good family so this isn t a case of my family in particular being like this because of lack of education 
MensRights,1616943068,You are conflating two things when you say  feminism here When the other person says feminism is rooted in hate he s talking about the ideology the underlying theories as well as the changes accomplished by mainstream feminism But you are shifting to treating  feminism as if the definition is  the collection of all people who label themselves feminists  which is a fairly useless definition I agree with you that many people who label themselves feminists truly believe in equality But the issue is that them labeling themselves feminists is kind of useless It s just a word in that context But when discussion the problems of feminism itself we aren t referring to  everyone who self labels as a feminist  we are referring to the ideology of feminism

MensRights,1616942871,There is something wrong with the fact you cannot make such an account for men  Women are    of Twitter s workforce  Whilst still technically a minority they re not heavily outnumbered  Also they don t seem to put  POC or the alphabet soup into the category of  men  and once you take them out of the equation I m sure that    would be considerably more than the  white male employees of the company  Can you imagine Twitter even allowing a  white males Twitter group amongst employees proudly citing the fact they work for the company  I can t 
MensRights,1616942834,I wouldn t even agree with that Anyone is allowed to have their own standards It s how you behave which becomes a problem If you only want to date women with big tits go for it You re limiting yourself and you are taking a risk that you might end up alone because you are removing so many potential partners from the pool But that doesn t make you a douchebag Now if you are treating women with smaller boobs like shit because of that Douchebag If you are body shaming the concept of smaller boobs Douchebag The way you behave can make you a douchebag But simply setting a standard for yourself that you only really want to date someone with big tits Not douchebag 
MensRights,1616942649,Advertisers take twitter seriously have you seen the state of youtube lately Lol
MensRights,1616942596,Agreed all around Much of the time the  if it were a man argument just feels baseless and paranoid Sorry to bring up other political topics but it feels the same as when people  insist that if January  th had been carried out by black people they d all be dead It s based on nothing but conjecture and that conjecture is based on the idea in people s heads that racism is far worse than it actually is There s no evidence that if they had been black they d all be dead But because people have convinced themselves that racism is so rampant they believe that s the case And that argument is toxic because it just feeds into it even more convincing even more people of something which might not even be true It s important to avoid that I do believe that men get a raw deal in the criminal justice system But it s important not to continually fan the flames back and forth by throwing out baseless assumptions that if a woman had been a man she d be treated worse All that does is make us all more mad about something which is likely true but might not be It s just a dangerous pattern So I agree with you 
MensRights,1616942591,I just stay away from the politics nobody takes political stuff on Twitter seriously
MensRights,1616942581,I think we need to note here FDS is significantly different than feminism One is about activism and the other is focused on the dating needs of women Are they bad Yes Are they the same No  Just cuz they both cater to women centric needs doesnt mean they are the same Some in there obviously have the hateful mindset tho

MensRights,1616941746,that s not productive lol I learned more abt this yesterday ik that it s wrong editing the comment would take away from it s integrity but i m very glad to be aware of it now 
MensRights,1616941611,Feminism has always been a hate movement in its heart Today that s all it is Anyone who calls themselves a feminist but says she cares about men as well is either uneducated or lying If after learning what her movement is she still refuses to call herself something else she is lying about her concern for men There are no real feminists who are not also feminazis There is a reason Cassie Jaye stopped calling herself a feminist Because she s honest and does care 
MensRights,1616941470,Nice The queen is oppressed and the peasants are the ones that are abusing their power of patriarchy 
MensRights,1616941312,When have you ever seen men be taught no means yes every single person I know was taught that they should be loving husbands who respect their spouses from a very early age and the  boys will be boys saying comes when you horseplay and someone gets a minor injury The majority of crimes are committed by men but the same men who in our society today are put through the wringer by knowingly false rape accusations Prince Charming standards and over all discrimination by the modern feminist There was a conference about male issues in America like the suicide rate being four times higher than females and there was another that was for women issues in America could you guess which one was ultimately protested and shut down We don t need to change how the men are raised except for the few that actually are raised like this we need to change society to really be equal which means losing equal outcomes I forgot to mention that men are predisposed to crime just because of biology but that isn t a reason anyone should commit a crime it s just a thing to add to the melting pot that is the reason someone commits a crime 
MensRights,1616940908,I don t understand your title You re talking about those people who say men should deal with their own problems and leave feminism to women but complain when we try to do so If so I agree  The thing is they re not opposed to men talking about their issue AS LONG as you do so in the way they want which won t achieve shit You re allowed to talk about your problems but you gotta adhere to their terms  patriarchy toxic masculinity  you gotta respect their oppression privilege ladder  men as the class who holds the power and women as victims and you re never never allowed to use generalizations the way they do That s pretty much places like the menslib sub where feminists control the discussion That s actually a very common trait of dictatorships by the way A controlled opposition places where people with dissenting opinions can share their views and concerns but only to a certain extent and only with the approval of their overlords 
MensRights,1616940510,Whilst I agree there are definite biological traits in men and women that should be respected they do not completely define us in the same way that our brains have evolved to moderate our basic impulses with reason so that our impulses no longer completely control us Human beings are remarkably plastic in adapting to new situations if there is just cause There is certainly merit in getting back on track with honouring our biological traits instead of allowing feminist fads to direct our evolution into self serving directions however reason should be the guiding factor in how we moderate those biological traits We also need to consider that there is indeed diversity in human beings homosexuality is a reality that blends some female traits with male traits so we can t insist on essentially male individuals being forced or encouraged to behave totally like a stereotypical heterosexual man That was attempted in forcing homosexual men to become heterosexual men and it not only failed it damaged those it tried to cure I believe there is greater diversity than we realise so it is not appropriate to try to mold every male into a traditional man I can accept that some men are confused by the constant barrage to be more like women but there will be others who do actually have some female traits who would benefit from having them accepted The difficulty is in discerning what traits are so intimately linked to our biology that they are essentially immutable and should not ever be attempted to be changed and which traits are more to do with unreasoning tradition and can be improved I think your innate desire of men to protect and provide is actually raw sex drive evolved with reason that protecting and providing for a woman is optimal in having readier access to sex plus it has symmetry with a woman wanting to protect and provide for a child which she can t do alone it s effectively an exchange that is reasonably well balanced I believe we have evolved further from that point but in a direction that has women now wanting everything including control over sex without giving anything in return to maintain the balance Furthermore in order to achieve this I believe women want to convert men into women with penises and that attempt at conversion is what we are seeing reflected in the confusion of young men because it goes against their most fundamental trait of their pursuit of sex which they feel but are told it should not exist for the comfort of women I had always understood that a man s fundamental drive was to spread his seed widely and perhaps that was how it was at the start until maybe he reasoned that a stable relationship with a single woman provided more sex than trying to obtain it with many reluctant women Thus I would say that some traits can evolve where they offer the potential for improvement but there will always be the immutable drive for sex underlying it all  and maybe some others I haven t addressed  Unfortunately evolution is not heading in the direction of improvements for men but the converse of  improvements for women at the expense of men I also don t agree with walking a path alone the indigenous Australian men s corroborees etc reflect a history of men s groups to guide a man s development It s only modern society that has largely abandoned guidance for its young and replaced it by permissiveness  to go it alone by trial and error which is confusing to young people who need direction The tendency for men to go it alone stems I think from the competitive spirit being encouraged rather than the cooperative spirit Competition leads to division and is a good match for the capitalist system but it ultimately is not a good outcome for a society that relies on its cohesion from cooperation and I think why society is crumbling As an exercise perhaps we should try identifying fundamental biological traits and others that are more socially influenced

MensRights,1616953781,Ok I see I indeed misunderstood misinterpreted your position from your original initial post My sinciere apoligies for this shortcoming on my side The problem with the culturally sensitive approach is that it is slow And in the case of Pakistan in my humble opinion it is too slow It brings about the long lasting trans generational change that is needed but in the case of Pakistan there is simply not enough time for this approach alone to resolve the situation  Here   you can see a video  maybe you have already seen it from your neighbour to the west Very different country culture political system for sure but it shows what the  not so culturally sensitive approach can provide Fast change in the face of entrenched couter productive cultural norms So maybe see it like this The culturally unsensitive approach is not meant to be liked or to appeal that was neither its aim nor its purpose In the metaphor of   the carrot and the stick    it is clearly playing the role of the stick Since Islam allows the husband to beat the wife  as a meassure of last resort with a stick provided that the stick is no thicker than his thumb consider the culturally insensitive approach to be the stick with which the women s movement can  beat back uncooperative men institutions Where previously the  culturally sensitive approach might have been considered the  extreme position it is now the  middle of the road position So maybe this perspective helps in understanding the overall strategy better In case you don t already know him and are interested in understanding the links between cultural norms demographics economy and the wealth and welbing of a society more deeply I can not recommend  Hans Rosling   enough  This video   of his quite fascinating and shows how seemingly irrelevant details have the greatest impact

MensRights,1616953504,What you are saying is absolutely true but men brains are programmed to be stimulated visually For example when advertisements are targeted towards men you ll see things like female feet next to a bear can female hands holding the product hair next that gillet shaving razor to show women approval So why wear tight shorts all these revealing pieces of cloth when married engaged serious committed relationship The only way to interpret this is that females want to keep their options open or seeking external validation

MensRights,1616952455,I don t understand what stance you re defending but you seem to be minimizing statutory rape  Middle school children  boys and girls aren t capable of sexual consent especially when it comes to sex with adults  Perhaps sex between two minors should be investigated as not necessarily being rape but once you get an adult involved they have such a greater responsibility of reason and restraint that it doesn t matter if the kid  wanted it  it s rape and manipulation  You could feed a child ice cream until they ended up in the hospital the child  wanting the ice cream doesn t excuse the negligence of the adult

MensRights,1616950631,This maybe interesting stuff to you It s the better man to make the argument for my position Women actually agreed it s accurate   
MensRights,1616950623,Monied interests turned towards supporting feminism when they realized they could drastically reduce the average wages they needed to pay by doubling the effective workforce 
MensRights,1616950525,The first paragraph is mainly valid criticism as these kinds of posts do exist yet the second is a generalization we should absolutely stay away from It is not constructive nor true 
MensRights,1616950476,I wouldn t be surprised if they are saying it is sexist against women that more suicide victims are men 
MensRights,1616950455,Would you be ok with using a pocket pussy instead of having real sex I sure as hell wouldn t You can t expect someone else to not want something just because you re not into it Like it or not sex is an important part of a relationship
MensRights,1616950365,I think it would be interesting if reddit were to make available some variety of data about the upvotes and downvotes I think you should crosspost this to  r dataisbeautiful and see if they can do anything to establish validity to this theory 
MensRights,1616950202,I ve decided to wear whatever the fuck I like too You don t have to shame women back into ankle length dresses Just grab your tights and go for a run dude  Their dislike doesn t cost you anything and their approval doesn t gain you anything 
MensRights,1616949812,Identity politics is a societal cancer We are individuals and should be free to remain so 
MensRights,1616949696,For your information the majority on inmates only serve half of their sentence in prison   years include prison AND probation If she would spend   years in prison the government would have no control over her since she served all her time 
MensRights,1616949695,I wonder what would have occurred if one or more of the Boys simply  refused to participate and whether disciplinary action had taken place Do the School Board Trustees not consider the greater effects of allowing Pricipals to run a School as  their own fiefdom  
MensRights,1616949532,Exactly if you rape a child then you should never have the right to move freely ever again in case you seek out more victims 
MensRights,1616949499, gt how does the feminist movement influence the government so greatly I think they are just very good at lobbying   and lying I ve come to the conclusion that whenever you see a statistic pushed by feminists you can bet what they say is false But people don t have the knowledge and time to find the source and check if what is said is correct When I put a link to a    page study on wage differences on twitter people tend to not want to read it Also both conservatives and  progressives are very happy to favor women and dismiss men in issues of parenting and violence  they are both very traditionalist in that regard They only differ on some points like abortion  gt    of state legislatures are woman      of state senate seats     state house or assembly seats  There is also the question of how many women are member of a party I think it s about     at least in Germany  How do you vote for women when they are not even there to get elected And then you read this  gt You re not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female  member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote meaning the quorum  could not be met and the bill died then and there  source     So basically feminists avoided shared parenting which would have equalized parenting duties which would in turn have given more time for mothers to get involved in politics I honestly hope that this sexist politic won t be the politic they support when there are more women in politics Because it turns out men are still voting for laws favoring women influenced by the feminist narrative Women are quite well represented by men because men tend to favor women On the other hand there are female MRAs and they do quite a good job So the big issue isn t men women involved in politics The issue is sexist people  which includes feminists  representing us 
MensRights,1616949257,I still think you are missing the point  The tweet or whatever is saying that if something as  innocent as showing shoulders by a girl is a distracting in school then the logical conclusion should follow that men shouldn t be able to drive either  Since that s a silly idea it also shines a light on the inherent silliness of the shoulder position  This  petition is actually on the side of men not against them as you seem to suggest 
MensRights,1616949107,Agreed even if not death at least life in prison especially the girl who raped  kids but thanks too a plea deal it was if the  children scarred for life didn t exist as if they meant nothing and only the one victim actually meant anything 
MensRights,1616949070, gt Nope I understand female bigotry perfectly  gt I m assuming you re a virgin considering your personality and clear hatred of men I didn t say you were a virgin did I Not all men only the ones who expresses explicit hatred towards women such as yourself But even then I wouldn t say it is a hatred just a mild disdain 
MensRights,1616949065,No women can rape other women it s not when the perpetrator has a penis They ll call it rape when a female teacher rapes a girl But the second the  victim has a penis it magically becomes something else 
MensRights,1616948899,I love it love reading it love hearing stories like this Things like this make it that much easier to write off relationships Ill just keep paying off houses keep making six figures keep being single 
MensRights,1616948888,Look to the case of Brian Banks if you want to know why 
MensRights,1616948859,She said they are both in the same stand point emotionally but physical damage may of been caused to the girl thus giving grounds for a higher sentencing She isn t saying that it s worse when a girl is raped she is just giving a potential reason for the sentence difference 
MensRights,1616948857,Either way both monsters deserve death in my opinion I don t think either one deserves  a break  I personally would kill both if given the green light 
MensRights,1616948724,Why is this not a big news all over the world Why are such crazy shits not getting enough coverage 
MensRights,1616948689,That is a fair point if there was physical damage to the girl than you are probably right on why the sentence was higher and we don t know if there was I guess in every situation there is bound to be variables 
MensRights,1616948507,I just looked at the website what is sexist Maybe I am looking at the wrong page Looks all gender neutral to me 
MensRights,1616948460,Yes he was referring to the conviction rate Conviction rate cannot be even used as an argument against a party It s a shortcoming of the justice system He says lower conviction rate means men are benefitting from it Which means he assumes men to be the wrongdoers in all cases by default 
MensRights,1616948366,I ll point out that tearing down an argument and tearing down a person are not the same thing But thank you for a well supported rebuttal 
MensRights,1616948294,Yes for him such cases are ought to be ignored as they are very small in number according to him 
MensRights,1616948209,Yes definitely emotionally neither child can deal with this appropriately Thankfully I don t think a  year old can produce sperm 
MensRights,1616948194,Ah I ll check that out I m really super to ideas if they re either backed by some sort of data or an otherwise a logically backed up claim  I too tend to avoid labels  My idea is that women do lack some rights as do men So can one be a true member of both MRA and FRA Both parties have different defecits and nobody really has the complete upperhand  With the government thing that must be true to some degree I ve been learning about more and more unbiased studies  amp reports esp about assault an such that show men are often abused and assaulted as well However looking at other objective data there are deficits for women    of state legislatures are woman      of state senate seats     state house or assembly seats Harris is the first F vice president and there still hasn t been a F pres  in your  valued and respected opinion how does the feminist movement influence the government so greatly 
MensRights,1616948154,Thanks for your answer I brought up this point to him He says such instances are negligible compared to the atrocities women face from men So it can be ignored 
MensRights,1616948098,And emotionally the little boy night not be able to have sex And financially he may be indebted to child support for   year
MensRights,1616948010,The thing is tho is that men don t all have the same preference some like curvier women some like more petite women some like both the same or are indifferent Some women don t mind a smaller dick but they have to talk like they are putting up with it I ve seen a video with this one couple who are very attracted to each other and their sex is very natural but when she talks to the viewer she says something along the lines of it s ok even if he doesn t have more than  inches he s still a good lover 
MensRights,1616947788,It spends two paragraphs with ppl trying to say she s a victim when she s not A man would get strung up for what she did why does to many having a vagina make her different 
MensRights,1616947741,Mayby but it s not the first time I saw that men s issues get downvoted more 
MensRights,1616947667,Feminists are like  yeah men are oppressors of women but like women have power because women have fought for their progress but like the patriarchy hurts men too and stuff And oh yeah men s problems are their own fault  
MensRights,1616947604,His life being ruined matters to me  but not to those who join the  pedophile lynch mob The ruining her life being ruined is ther significant factor is because society desiring him is INTENDED to protect HER when their result is the opposite I make the sadnes argument with Villi Fualaau and Mary k Laturneau Punishing her punished him 
MensRights,1616958533,Don t pay it any mind my friend Well what I actually mean is don t let this sink in any more than being just a glancing blow on your psyche Yeah speak up against it and inform people how you feel about it but know it s just typical misandry nonsense 
MensRights,1616958524, gt What am I to prove The fact that men have sent me rape and death threats As if that s a seldom occurrence on social media lol  Yes Absolutely The accusation you made is what you have to prove  gt Ew Blocked No way in hell do I want to hear from you again And here we have the natural response of a liar When prompted for evidence  in this case actually easy to provide  block and run   how dare you ask for evidence for an accusation      Go ahead run somewhere that lying is enough 
MensRights,1616958515,They have a policy against targeted discrimination based on gender but it doesn t apply to men Just like any other tech company

MensRights,1616958224,And then these same women are busy getting their backs blown out by chads and tyrones thinking they are the one Or maybe they have hit the wall and no one wants them anymore And this is not some hate I am saying just a simple fact of modern day life 
MensRights,1616958105,Yeah that is what I said It s difficult to talk about this issue because it s seen as a taboo and you get shut down pretty fast when you try to talk about it I already help and educate guys around me As I said educating guys especially the young ones about this is mandatory if we want to bring a change 
MensRights,1616958056,I posted here to get men opinion on this wasn t really concerned with how females felt about what i had to say
MensRights,1616957806,so because we decided not to do something for guys now twitter is sexist 
MensRights,1616957731, They re emotionally unintelligent is rich coming from someone who thinks pink hair and a septum piercing is a personality 
MensRights,1616957702,Research and studies prove my point when i say men brains males and females are different let s not put the classic feminist argument when they say they are not and scientists who spent years researching these differences can go f themselves 
MensRights,1616957674,So let s talk this out It is a constitutional right to sex despite age or gender or consent Are you sure you that s the direction to go Man if rape culture was actually real we would have just hit the lottery 
MensRights,1616957491,what do people even mean when they say  emotionally fulfill I was never more than an ATM to a lot of these women to begin with and they say I m the under developed one lol 
MensRights,1616957453,I m in favor of mens rights but isnt it different for women The woman has everything to loose in the relationship the power dynamic is in the boys favor eventhough he is young
MensRights,1616957368,Good luck weaseling out of a simply worded amendment to the constitution  A few supreme court cases later    LOL 
MensRights,1616957345,They love that argument don t they  This is just how it is and you re too stupid to get it  continue this conversation  whatever else 
MensRights,1616957327,The truth is it is really different Men brain interpret visual things in a way completely different especially skin And if you disagree you can read this journal   The visuals in commercials are only to attract men attention and not to disregard the quality of a product and you mentioning it in that way shows that you are here to disagree instead of understanding the purpose of the example i have given  Saying that this is toxic isn t really valid asking men to be okay with other psychopaths and people stare in an uncomfortable way checking their partners definitely is Skin isn t something anyone should show in public In private with their partner is the correct place for wearing whatever Clothes are designed in a way that highlights women curves boobs and asses  I don t understand how this hard to understand and apply in reality
MensRights,1616957123,Personally I believe that there s nothing much difference between a man and a woman besides their capacity to have sperm and egg cells  For all the times I got sexually harassed I remind myself that there were guys in my life who didn t made me feel unsafe People who gets swayed easily is what we call gullible Gullible people are good for the business I honestly believe that men are deep thinkers too I get irritated when people generalize men with the similar words like the ones you just said  men brains are programmed to be stimulated visually because for someone to be easily swayed one must not have deep values and life principles  in other words shallow  Commitment goes deep as living with someone s good life principles There are old couples who lasted the relationship for more than   years and married men aren t always stimulated visually by their wives they have long lasting relationship because they live by their life principles and deep values That s what commitment is about understanding that we are going to embody each other s deep values and life principles and nothing about it feels forced  I m sorry for the lengthy reply I just don t think that all men are shallow as how you described  men brains to be 
MensRights,1616957116,I don t think we need radical groups like BLM Pakistan has a history of far right groups and also a few far left groups What Pakistan need is a steady progress in investment in health care education and the economy There is no need for radical movements Pakistan is a country that has to go forward with taking into accounts other large ethnic groups within Pakistan who all have their own history and cultures It would be unwise to impose western backed movements that want to forcibly change its culture 
MensRights,1616957104,Yeah you just don t give a flying fuck about the subject and yet you are there spilling non sense and not listening to the arguments that are given to you Whatever I won t loose more time with you
MensRights,1616957051,Well sorta yes sorta no Aparenlty if your unwilling to date single mom s your a sexist pig you know according to twox
MensRights,1616957040,You are making a claim about frequency and the statistics make it clear that you are wrong It s really simple   Men in India get false charges any time they don t marry the women they screw   Uh the base rape of rape charges makes them rare   Well screw the statistics amarite  
MensRights,1616956991,It s  proof  is it Want to provide that proof then Because otherwise you re being the same level of close minded idiot this person is It s a fucking social media platform not an IQ test 
MensRights,1616956919,Because when feminist movement was started womens issues were really fucked up so it s main goal was to improve their rights until men and women were equal 
MensRights,1616956850,I mean using tik tok is already proof of incredibly low iq so let her have fun in the little bubble of clown she surrendered herself with
MensRights,1616956692,The problem is not primarily one of genetics but of gestation and the duration of child reering  which is of course ultimately determined by genetics in sofar you re correct  The role contribution of the man can be substituted  sperm banks sex toys and or split up and socialized  welfare state provides police protects      The role of the woman can not There is no artificial womb that allows a man to reproduce indepently without the explicit contribution from an individual women This power imbalance is in my humble opinion the heart of the issue 
MensRights,1616956518, Actually feminism is worse than cancer at least cancer doesn t spread  You really need to get your facts straight 
MensRights,1616956496,I don t have to explain shit If you can t understand me that s your problem now fuck off 
MensRights,1616956484,This is what I said Forget stats I can cite   more sources if you want You can go and ask any and I do mean literally any cop lawyer Even a woman constable would do So would a supreme court judge As I said my own mother who is quite a reputed lawyer tells me that       of all rape cases filed in Mumbai are false 
MensRights,1616956423,How about you actually explain why you are commenting that you haven t experienced something in regards to people saying that they have
MensRights,1616956414,This clearly tells the difference between us OP did not abuse you But you abuse him
MensRights,1616956315,Don t forget about the legions of women who divorce their husband because he lost his job or lost his money All men are is a piggy bank to most women sadly 
MensRights,1616956292,How about you read what I ve actually put and stop trying to find hidden meanings in something that doesn t have any 
MensRights,1616956260,This is base rate fallacy In      there are       rape cases in India a country of     billion in a country where the average age is    The US sees over  x that with a pop one quarter the size and average age of    Age matters because younger people are far more likely to be the victims of rape  If the data says that rape cases are rare in India which it does then false rape cases are also rare 
MensRights,1616956248,  gt Whoosh right over your head  gt The reason this is important is that feminists adhere to the lie that men are dangerous and that women are justified in being afraid of men because men pose a significant danger to women  which is clearly not the case  They frame the argument as being one of safety for women but their disinterest in suicide as an issue underlines the fact that feminists in fact don t care about women s safety since suicide is a far graver threat to women Their concern about  femmicide is about spreading fear and hatred against men It s not about women s safety Why is it that everytime I queried something with one of you you can t help but respond with condescension or passive aggression Do you not know how to debate with reason and rationality Or are you just so angry at us females you can t control your emotions so cross  The point I m making is that you are pointing out the   blindingly obvious  as if it is some light bulb moment when common sense should have told you that anyway  Feminists have never argued that men kill women more than women kill themselves They d argue that more men commit violent acts against women than do woman for sure It is far more reasonable to compare genders in homicide rates than bringing suicide into the equation  The only people who seem to be surprised by this common sense information are you  men s rights activists not feminists so what exactly have you achieved Other than to perhaps to feel more validated in your beliefs and cogntivie distortions And if you genuinely believe that feminists don t care about female mental health then perhaps I can understand why you were so surprised that suicide figures exceed homicide figures because you must be pretty damn ignorant There are an abundance of mental health charities geared towards women that were founded by feminists And feminism as an epistemology has a whole wealth of literature on mental health so I ve no idea where you arrived at that conclusion 
MensRights,1616956224, gt Nah no one brigaded me personally this round but since I ve received multiple rape and death threats in my dms over the months from the men that frequent this sub Lol Of course you have I mean you won t provide a link of proof and expect to be taken seriously just because you say so We aren t feminists   you have to provide evidence before you are believed   just lying to get your way doesn t work here
MensRights,1616956220,Agreed but the movements currently going on are specific to one group just like BLM in the west We need a movement which takes all of the people in it without any divisions but it most likely will never happen 
MensRights,1616956206,yuuuup can t hang around guy tards and then say all men are tards
MensRights,1616956181, gt  Anyone has even any idea what she could have meant      Did you try asking her None of us can read her mind so kinda pointless to ask tbh   I ve seen people try to argue that mandatory service for men is sexist against women because of military benefits and they way that military people are  treated like heroes    Yes she was an idiot and no telling her that women can also join the military did not change her mind      Also idk if you re talking about the US military but gay men absolutely can join There has never been a time where lesbians were allowed in and gay men were not 
MensRights,1616956086,No it s not Are you trying to say that sexual assault of men doesn t happen because you haven t experienced it
MensRights,1616956075,Female teachers need training for handling male students and supporting their needs 
MensRights,1616956047, gt Damn  You sound like a feminist caricature of MRAs Yes pointing out how badly marriage and family law is biased against st men is a  caricature  Men will understandably sacrifice for children There is no reason to make the sacrifice of marrying if there can be no children 
MensRights,1616955963,Paternity leave is great for the couple too it doesn t just leave the woman on her own dealing with a new born child Most European countries now have decent paternity leave but I think the US just lags behind because apparently its too socialist and according to Americans socialism communism satanic virus lol 
MensRights,1616955961,Marriage is a legal harm to men It outs then in a position to be at the mercy of their spouse and the court system Without children there is no reason for men to take that risk 
MensRights,1616955896,well that s because all of those women are emotional children that cannot control themselves So when they see a man who is able to act like a normal human being they just can t understand it They think it s all supposed to be crying at the drop of a hat throwing shit constantly and cheating 
MensRights,1616955860,If you re going with a fashion statement of clown in blender and spraffing this horse shite then it s reasonable to assume your lights are on but no ones home 
MensRights,1616955597,And so now wages will be equalised not by increasing the wages of women but by slowly reducing the real wages of men Boy has that plan worked out well for everyone 
MensRights,1616955485,I haven t seen this show is it any good  Judging by your posts I think it s another girl power crap from hollywood where boys men will be humiliated I hope I am wrong though 
MensRights,1616955443,I agree with you      A lot of feminists in western countries complain about really unnecessary things while ignoring the real issues Even if we ignore men for a moment in feminism and only focus on women they don t even take serious steps to help them There are also things like manspreading mansplaining writing the spellings of  woman in a weird way to avoid the word  man  Whenever I see these kinds of videos and they complain about how they have it hard because of these things I always wonder but what about women in third world countries 
MensRights,1616955336, gt but it might just not be seen as eqully big problem And why would that be Is it because we re privleged over you women  gt But yeah we could do better No could  SHOULD do better  You BETTER do better 
MensRights,1616955306,Except people should be okay with what someone else is wearing Seems like you haven t come here to talk about men s rights but to create a post that can be crosdposted somewhere else
MensRights,1616955294,        I can give you   more links are sources tell you to read this and that but it is all useless As I said go to any lawyer cop  a woman lawyer cop all you want They will tell you how incredible false rape cases are  amp  x   B i had written the below post in r india around  weeks ago but for some reason the post was   My mother a lawyer quite a reputed one tells me that       of all rape cases filed in Mumbai are false non genuine I have been warned by my mother never to use dating apps or to ever be in a live in relationship Even on the internet I remember reading an article by a woman lawyer from Delhi who described herself as a feminist stating how    of all rape cases in Delhi are false I did not think much about it until a colleague of mine was threatened with one and had to pay  lakh in avoid to be implicated in a false rape case  After researching about it and talking to several people the issue seems to bigger than I ever thought of Most rape cases in tier   tier  cities are just women filing it after a relationship turns sour In many cases it is the woman s parents that file rape cases In northern India especially in Delhi many parents file rape cases against the girl s ex boyfriend lover just to dissuade him from ever talking to the girl again Many parents also file rape cases against the girl s ex boyfriend lover as a rape victim is considered to more honourable than the girl having previous relationship A rape victim has to give less dowry than the girl having past relationship This might seem absurd and even laughable  but it happens and it happens a lot Some tips to avoid being implicated in a false rape case    Never just never have sexual relation with your girlfriend until you get married to her In India a man can never leave his girlfriend after he has had sexual relations with her Heck he can never leave her even if he sees her fucking with another man That is how fucked up Indian laws are   If possible never ever talk to your female colleagues in your office Now this might seem extreme to some but these days you never know People who work in young startups probably know what I am talking about There is a huge division these days between men and women working in young startups Even in USA where I lived and wasted  years of my life I could see how divided men and women were in my office post the me too movement I see a similar trend happening in India these days   Never hire a female maid if possible Maids falsely implicating the men in the house has become really really common   Do not ever argue with women for parking spots and don t ever get into a road rage fight with a woman for the woman can charge you under sec     outraging the modesty of the woman Now this doesn t take away the fact that most genuine cases      go unreported or that much of India especially the Hindi Heartland can be an absolute nightmare for women All I am talking about is tier  and tier  cities Edit For people who think that cases which are not proved in court are termed as false cases are wrong For example USA has a rape conviction of around        But    rape cases are not considered false I am talking about cases which are proved to be downright false after due process of court I am also talking about cases where the girl has filed the complaint on  false pretext of marriage Edit   I write this post after doing extensive research on this topic for one whole month In the space on  month I talked to some      lawyers  almost everyone in my extended family is a lawyer  a cop read several articles I could back up my claims with endless sources and links but choose not to For people who doubt what I have written they can themsel go to any cop lawyer in any tier   tier  city they want to   
MensRights,1616955236,This is so true I consider myself a radical leftist but everyone says I have the most right wing policies and I always found it so weird What s wrong with wanting an ethno state anyhow   s 
MensRights,1616955228,Both India and Pakistan need movements to help women and men from disadvantaged backgrounds There is large wealth inequality in both countries and in case of Pakistan a challenge from the radical Islamists which for the last few years have died down a bit but a large part of the state continues to support Islamists which is leading to stagnation of Pakistan and large number of Pakistani talent leaving for overseas  Last time I went to Islamabad it was around the same time as the women s azadi march from what I ve learnt about Pakistani feminists is that there are two types The movement has been taken over by the rich liberal elite and bored housewives who want to westernise Pakistan these are the same people who would be more then happy to see their country bombed back to stone age just to please the West I think a lot of western NGO s are pumping money into Pakistan by funding these people while ignoring the men and women from working class backgrounds who really need help in regards to access to clean water education and health care 
MensRights,1616955213,Whoosh right over your head The reason this is important is that feminists adhere to the lie that men are dangerous and that women are justified in being afraid of men because men pose a significant danger to women  which is clearly not the case  They frame the argument as being one of safety for women but their disinterest in suicide as an issue underlines the fact that feminists in fact don t care about women s safety since suicide is a far graver threat to women Their concern about   femmicide is about spreading fear and hatred against men It s not about women s safety

MensRights,1616955114,I don t think it s no different for women I feel like the way I see sexually appealing guys and gals has the same stimulation for when men sees a sexually appealing woman I think the only reason why advertisements doesn t have sexually appealing men for female products is that we get stimulated visually but it s not enough reason to blindly purchase commercial goods  It s the same sentiment for why people don t feel sexually harassed when I m near them I find people sexually appealing but it s not enough reason to make them feel uncomfortable  I m not yet married so I have no say for married couples but when I was in a serious relationship clothes didn t matter at all I wore shorts and good looking clothes because they make me feel good I liked the feeling of being pretty even in ordinary clothes Not once did it occur to me to wear revealing clothes just so I can attract people  I sincerely think that if partners want to keep their options open they wouldn t seek it from shallow people who gets easily sexually tensed over some skin The reason she s with you isn t because you got sexually aroused when you saw her pretty it s because you re a good natured person so if she likes to seek other partners it ll be someone who is much good natured as you are but less toxic 
MensRights,1616954936,I mean stuff here in south africa is kind of weird in terms of a lot of stuff like court doesn t really have the people besides the judge the accused accuser and their lawyers there aren t the civilians is what I mean like there s a bunch of murder I guess but there s also a large amount of rape last I heard the rate s roughly     Which isn t good considering I ve got many female relatives and that s bad enough but also of course the court s response to rape cases the defendant s lawyer strategy is usually to intimidate the victim into silence with lots of questions which is hard on them as   well you know now the strategy s bad enough but a lot of the time when they have all the evidence they need guy still goes free due to judges here being weird I mean at least the healthcare here s better though I mean you can give birth for free at least Like it would be cheaper to fly from the USA to a hospital here recover here and then fly back than just the cost of giving birth there  Gotta love how some feminists care about smaller issues in america  like sexist air conditioning  but bigger issues like rape in south africa lotsa human rights violations in  specifically urban like small isolated villages India  the cities are hellholes for dudes legally though  and I m sure other countries they don t talk as much about Also the fact that they not only don t help MR  which in itself isn t great but isn t condemnable  but they actively fight against it like Mary P Koss  reason why men cannot who get raped are not considered to be raped legally  my point A fair amount of feminists focus all their attention on problems that minorly affect a few people yet ignore the larger issues and also actively try to prevents mensrights Used to be feminist not anymore

MensRights,1616960308,You can t fix gynocentrism It s hardwired into our species for men to protect and provision for women However what always made it fair and effective is that men were given the authority to protect and provision Women being physically weaker and vulnerable when bearing children had a biological need to transfer accountability for the family s safety to men In order for men to take accountability they also required authority You can t protect a person that refuses to listen to you The problem we see is gynocentrism which is the female privilege of abdicating accountability to men has run rampant while its necessary counterpart male authority has been completely squashed Western countries are mostly democracies where the vote of the majority holds the power Since women are slightly more of the population and have a much stronger in group bias they tend to vote as bloc and they tend to vote for policies that on the surface benefit themselves The problem we see is just going to continue to get worse because women as a group hold much more political power The only way to fix gynocentrism in Western society is to reestablish patriarchy and curb female power Which that doesn t get rid of gynocentrism which is simply hardwired into our biology but it balances it out in a system that works However since voting rights are the only way to do that it won t get done Men have collectively agreed that women should have equal power in the voting booth there s not any political will among men to collectively curb the female voting bloc Some folks have proposed an alternative that only net tax payers  those who have a  stake in the government should be allowed to vote I think this would be a good alternative because it s not gender based and the net effect would be that it would deny people voting themselves more and more of the government s money  women collectively pay only half the taxes men do yet receive double the amount of total government benefits

MensRights,1613352671,What is the best age to circumcise  Circumcision removes healthy genital tissue that is prima facie valuable while imposing  the risk of a number of surgical complications ranging from mild to severe the full extent of which is understudied and unknown The favorable attitude of non voluntary neonatal male circumcision  proponents toward the procedure appears to be at odds with that taken towards medically unnecessary surgeries more generally especially when the affected person cannot consent      Accordingly from a moral point of view which includes a medical cost benefit analysis as only one part of the overall ethical analysis we find that medically unnecessary circumcision should not be performed on minors who cannot provide ethically valid consent to the procedure   Neonatally circumcised homosexual males or heterosexual males who practice safe sex will receive virtually no HIV related benefit whilst bearing the burden of unsafe choices made by others It is also worth remembering that circumcision is not a failsafe intervention it does not prevent HIV  or any other sexually transmitted infection  Rather it may merely reduce one s risk of contracting the virus by around half per coital act assuming  for the sake of argument that the African findings are both accurate and generalizable   The point is that no one other than the owner of the penis is better positioned to determine whether they wish to assume the risk that circumcision might permanently compromise their sexual enjoyment A person who seeks circumcision in adulthood also has the advantage of  being able to explain to the surgeon exactly how they want the procedure performed   In the case of an adult any complications that do occur are the result of a procedure that was voluntarily undertaken after the adult had been informed about the nature and likelihood of these very risks This is not possible in the case of the neonate or young child  Generally speaking risks imposed on a person who is aware of the risks and agrees to assume them in light of their own considered preferences and values are much less morally objectionable than risks imposed on a person who is not aware of the risks and or does not agree to assume them

MensRights,1613330033,For example A man can t drop out of the rat race and be secure but most women can do that BUT then again men can reach a far higher place So the range is wider Men can reach higher but the bottom is also deeper  I think a lot of the issues that are raised here is that men want the bottom to not be as deep as women want to be able to reach as high as men and that is seen as a double standard cause men end up with the short end of the stick  Hope it made much sense

MensRights,1613220859,It s no secret the US Family Court system is discriminatory against fathers gaining and retaining custody of their children Some states are really good about considering both sides but some like mine just believe the mother because shes the mother They CRY  shes the mother she has rights  but what about the father What about his rights What about the kids rights What about the child s right to not be abused In too many cases that I ve seen the father is the obvious choice yet custody is still granted to the mother who just abuses the kids  Let me tell you a little bit of my and my fathers story I was born in the US to my amazing father and my thundercunt mother I m not exactly clear on the time line but I know meth was involved before my birth I know my mother was using it when I was in utero But it wasnt long after my birth that my father told thundercunt he had enough of the meth and they needed to stop NOW She didnt like that and after a physical altercation there was a legal battle where she had falsely accused my dad of rape and assault It was so obviously a lie my dad got off with only a minor assault charge that he got only because he took a plea to get me back  Meanwhile me and my  half sister are living with thundercunt her boyfriend and his kid Let s just say it wasnt good for us We had almost lethal amounts of meth in our system we were starved beaten and our childhood ruined from the start But Sisters dad got her tested for drugs and when that much meth was found in her system we were taken and she was given to her dad I was given to my maternal grandparents for about  months But I was taken after more neglect specifically medical care Then I went to my dad again I lived with my dad from  to   And there I had an actual childhood So many good memories we share from that time One of my favorites is that when my dad had a day off he would take me to this awesome amusement park Hed tell me we were going there and I d be so excited I drop whatever I was doing  probably drawing on my big easel and I d be running out of the house half dressed Hed have to chase after me like  Babygirl Come back You need your pants on  Wed get there and my dad would be conservative with his money of course but one day I reeeeeallllly wanted to go on the go cart track again after we had spend all the money loaded onto our pass My dad just tried it even if nothing was on it   and it worked  He asked the staff at the ride how many credits he had left and he had over the max credits Whoever last loaded that card made it a master card where you cant run out of credits My dad says he thinks it was a mistake But I think we ran into a certain staff member who saw this dad with his little hyperactive shadow who was just so excited to be there with her dad They probably noticed my dad didnt have terribly much to load onto the card so they made it into a master card Why the hell not It s just a button on their computer away And we certainly deserved it It s amazing the little kindnesses you ll notice if you look around  But anyway from day one my dad and I have been two peas in a pod I am him just little and female One glance at us and its obvious And we go perfectly together even in conflict we still have that harmony I was a really easy kid I was fine doing my own thing most of the time and even though I liked playing with other kids I didnt need other kids to feel content I m a quick learner I just need the how what and why answered and I understand But I definitely struggled with some things really hard Coordination to name one I d eat shit pretty much everyday Once I hit school age my dad knew from my teachers and his observations that I obviously had a learning disability of some kind  Then re enter thundercunt Thundercunt left us alone until I was  which was when she wanted visitation My dad fought hard against it because I didn t want to see her AT ALL But in the end he had HIS OWN LAWYER AGREE that she should be allowed visitation So then I started having supervised visits with her And those were fine only a couple of hours Then she got overnight unsupervised visitation And things got weird I d come home and for a few days I d be in this weird mood I d be shut off shit down nervous anxious unable to sit down and not very responsive I wouldnt look him in the eye When my dad would press me a little for answers as to what happened during these visits I d be very vague never giving him a clear answer Which that just isnt me I was a joyous kid Ask me a question and I ll answer  more you didnt know you had And whenever my daddy said my name he immediately got my attention and my eyes This just wasnt me at all And what made my dad even more nervous is that when he asked who was there during the visit I said  Mommy told me not tell you who was there  So then thundercunt starts to pick on my dad for every little mark on my body accusing him of abusing me She tries to make a CPS case against him over every little thing But all the marks were from me eating shit all the goddamn time So it wasn t working for her Until one day I had a mark on my face from the dog and thundercunt said I had a bite on my face My dad checked again and again and there no such thing But the next day when I had a visit with her I had a huge bite mark on my face And it was ugly I never got to talk to my dad after that to tell him what happened Thundercunt took me into her work during our visit and into the bathroom She kissed my check then bit me and HARD She apologized and locked me in an office as I cried She left me there who knows how long and then called the police at her work  And I was taken away I was given to my maternal grandparents then my thundercunt mother And I hated it I just shut down I became chronically depressed at age   She tried at first I could tell but it wasnt long before I was being locked in my bedroom for hours and hours I had my first suicide attempt at age  because I felt so alone and sad She hated me even mentioning my dad I d get hit if I dared refer to him anything other than a sperm donor  My dad fell into depression too suicide attempts too   But child support took so much of his money It got to a point he was only getting     of his paycheck a month And they took away his professional license so he couldn t work then his driver s license so he couldnt even drive to work if he wanted to and it just got him stuck in this hole And of course he never got visitation with me When he went to court for his visitation  thundercunt got a slap on the wrist and was told to attend visitation But she never did So my dad was stuck going into debt because of child support he was paying for the little girl he couldnt even see anymore  As the years go on thundercunt gets a boyfriend who s a peice of shit A MONSTER I ll spare you the gorey details but from age      this dude physically emotionally mentally sexually financially ritualistically and religiously abused me and other kids they took in They drugged me to abuse me make me forget and manipulate me It s a horror movie like situation I tried many times to report them to CPS but COS would come around investigate talk to thundercunt tell her EVERYTHING I TOLD THEM then leave me at home with them again They seemed to care about what I had to say until they talked to thundercunt who would tell them I am developmentally disabled and the case would be dismissed on that note Or thundercunt threatened me into dismissing the case  After I hit   they kicked me out with nothing No life skills no money no job not even a high school diploma So I was homeless most of      But they were still claiming I was living with them for child support  Now me and my dad have been reunited and we re going to be seeking justice for the both of us We couldn t be happier just being together again Which just goes to show we shouldn t have ever been separated in the first place  The sad ing is that this isnt close to the only story like this I ve heard If I had a dollar for everytime I heard about a similar situation I d have enough to pay for my college tuition   So yeah the family court is against men and it shouldn t  be just because of a spike of father led abuse almost    years ago This needs to stop because I am a lucky one who made it out I didnt make it out okay or even in one piece but I made it out So many dont make it out Either they re killed or they just shut themselves off to everyone GIVE BOTH PARENTS A FAIR CHANCE AT CUSTODY STOP ASSUMING THE MOTHER IS THE BEST

MensRights,1613454092,I ve been trawling through UN documents and in the lastest one the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women comes right out and states redistribution of power and resources to women is one of their goals The Committee makes recommendations to States This one was about the application of  temporary special measures which are intended to make up for discrimination  Here are a couple of choice quotes which I found shocking   General recommendation No    Article   paragraph   of the Convention  temporary special measures    amp  x   B  gt    Measures taken under article   paragraph   by States parties should aim to accelerate the equal participation of women in the political economic social cultural civil or any other field The Committee views the application of these measures not as an exception to the norm of nondiscrimination but rather as an emphasis that temporary special measures are part of a necessary strategy by States parties directed towards the achievement of de facto or substantive equality of women with men in the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms While the application of temporary special measures often remedies the effects of past discrimination against women   the obligation of States parties under the Convention to improve the position of women to one of de facto or substantive equality with men exists irrespective of any proof of past discrimination   The Committee considers that States parties that adopt and implement such measures under the Convention do not discriminate against men  amp  x   B  gt    Although the application of temporary special measures may not be possible under all the articles of the Convention the Committee recommends that their adoption be considered whenever issues of accelerating access to equal participation on the one hand   and accelerating the redistribution of power and resources   on the other hand are involved as well as where it can be shown that these measures will be necessary and most appropriate under the circumstances    Source PDF

MensRights,1613409280,I ve been raising hell any time I encounter someone who uses the sexist and hateful slur  mansplaining   I wrote a letter of complaint to the Mars Corporation over their use of the term in their Super Bowl ad  There is no legitimate use of this word  It s used to shut down discussion via shaming and it implies that a man s explanation is automatically invalid based on gender alone  Our society would never tolerate targeting other groups with this kind of word creation  Imagine if a major company like Mars had used words like  jewsplaining   blacksplaining   femsplaining  or even  chinasplaining   There would be an uproar and rightfully so  So I wrote them back to let them know that s not acceptable   I ve also complained on social media any time someone uses that bigoted word  It s a word dreamed up by hateful feminists to denigrate men  There is no legitimate use of it  I ve seen feminists claim it s needed to express the idea of a man explaining to a woman in a condescending way but that s a cop out  That s still stereotyping men as people who act that way  Condescending speech has no gender  We have non gender biased terms in English for expressing that idea   I ve encountered people being very surprised that someone would object to this term  They try to belittle me to shut me up by saying the same old cliches like  fragile male ego   which is another sexist and hateful term   But I won t back down  I ve had it up to here with this bigoted term and so I m fighting back   I m curious if any of my brothers out there have had similar experiences and what you ve done to fight back against this hate speech  I won t stand for this hypocritical and sexist word being normalized  There are other man bashing  sexist terms but this is the one that really disgusts me   If you ve been fighting back as well please let me hear from you  But if you wish to write to try to justify this term of hate please don t bother  You should not try to justify misandry on a men s rights board  You can go find some other forum where this type of hate speech is tolerated   But to those of you who have been fighting back against this bigotry thank you

MensRights,1613404606,Yes I generalized the question just so you can make a sense out of it for me I m a big puzzle enthusiast and love everything about them   important   Someone was arguing with me about how it s unfair that men and women don t compete against each other I gave her not one but three examples and she told me that they don t count These are the examples   There are competitions for Rubik s cube type twisty puzzles known as speed cube competitions In those competitions both guys and girls compete against each other to get the fastest time There are many types of events for multiple puzzles But most of the time both guys and girls are competing against each other   The same is the case with chess Both men and women compete against each other Yes there might be events for women only or men only but it doesn t mean men and women don t compete against each other even in a professional competition   Similarly in the competition of Sudoku both men and women compete against each other I m sure there are a lot but these were the ones that came on top of my head Generally speaking I may not know any competitions related to strength but I know at least  competitions related to wits where men and women compete with each other Why is it that these examples don t count if they are not that famous or not related to strength As a puzzle enthusiast my opinion might be biased in favour of puzzles so I would like your opinion about it

MensRights,1613738591,Just watched a TikTok about a women whose studying to be a doctor joking about how she s in debt while women are making money off of OF No problem with the video scrolled down to the comments One guy said something along the lines of  You re good They re ruining people s lives and you ll be helping people s lives  One woman replied its the men who are ruining their lives Ok Another comment said women are profiting off of  misogyny  First of all women need to stop acting like these women doing OF are some morally upright women cause they re not They re in love with money and see a chance to use their looks to profit off of LONELY DESPERATE DEPRESSED and traumatised addicted men Cause that s most of the men buying OF they wanna feel special which is why they go with a single creator but usually their lives are hell Its the men s choice yeah just as a drug addict goes to the dealer by their own choice but these women are shallow They are essentially worsening their lives by providing for their addiction to sexual content The horrible effects of p rn and m sturbation addiction so no they re not completely out of blame or atleast they re not good people Its funny that women doing OF is  empowering but the men paying are  misogynistic  Feminists love demonizing men for anything because they want to perceive men as evil The men paying are lonely and need female attnetion most likely depressed too However it s easier to disconnect from a person if you view them as subhuman so feminists will say that instead Its funny cause they ll show so much sympathy to traumatised and mentally ill p rn stars but no sympathy for p rn addicts with the same conditions I m starting to feel like women are aware of this too That s why so many women advertise their new OF pages on dating apps They target lonely men and get them to spend all their money Its sick

MensRights,1613697172,I came across a interesting fact recently In a survey done by the CDC in      the most recent gender comparison survey by the CDC  called the  National Intimate Partner and Sexual Abuse Survey   more men reported intimate partner domestic abuse then women  I will be rounding to the thousand in this post for simplicity           men reported it compared to          women Now we already know women will victim blame men so let me drop that right here The difference between these two numbers is around          which would be    of intimate partner domestic abuse reported in this survey Domestic abuse in gay relationships is thought to be about    so let s do the math That would be        of the total           So now we still have a        difference between both numbers and          cases left Since we accounted for homosexual relationships all of those          cases are women abusing men Now to be fair we will take the    lesibian and gay relationship abuse is about the same and subtract that from the           Now since the same amount was from both sides we have a difference of        again and the numbers for women are now           all come by men Now that we ve accounted for homesexual relationships and covered all the statistical mumbo jumbo we can get to the interesting part If men are abused so much more in relationships then why are abusive relationships stereotyped as men abusing women and women get more support in this aspect   They twisted the narrative and told half the truth As an major example of them getting more support let s talk about the good ol VAWA  or was it VAVA  Basically they use government money to support intimate domestic abuse shelters and such But they have a large bias against men  mEn CaNt bE AbUsed ThEy ArE StRoNgEr and won t fund men s domestic abuse shelters but will gladly give money to a women only one On top of that this bias actually harms men in abusive relationships a lot Not only are they usually turned down from most domestic abuse shelters they are even arrested after they call the police for help because they assume  man stronger  man instigator  Now why are people ignoring this It s because feminism told white lies and made  reinforced stereotypes of men being abusive There s basically this same attitude towards men being raped but that s a different story And the worst thing about it is feminists always victim blame and say  well men are the ones doing it  I already disproved that and  it s the patriarchy s fault  feminism slang for  some men were in power   years ago so it s mens fault for all this  It may sound like I m going a bit over the top here but it s just so hypocritical Any suggestions comments This is my first time making such a large post on such a large topic

MensRights,1613867100,I just got out of this mess happening and thought I needed to vent a bit to get this thing out of my mind and move on with the movie I was watching beforehand     So I a        cm engineering student live in a condo  many houses enclosed by a wall with my family for the time being during the pandemic My brother was playing football in the courtyard when out of nowhere a dog comes running in his direction and grabs the ball out of his feet and proceeds to destroy the ball We my family is pretty close to our neighbors and the dog was not familiar  which directly led him to think it might have rabies which is why we didn t fight back  He get s home is very sad and irritated because it was his only birthday present for last year  of course no party thanks to COVID and says the dog is still in the courtyard and is worried he may go after the balls that were still there from the younger kids from the other side of the street My father who has a history of very complicating diseases and if catches the virus is sure to be dead within the week goes out to help me pick up the other balls and we proceed to lock the dog in the court to keep it from running away before we find it s owner     Right after we do that we hear one of our  what pandemic  female neighbors who parties every week coming out calling the dog s name and obviously does not have a mask on I repeat  five times calling her to  put your mask on as she hurries down the hill She stops no more than   cm   foot from my face when I tell her  will I have to hold you back  and she replies with  If you touch me I ll call the cops on you   Nervous but level minded as I could be I reply with  No problem now put on your mask  She goes right back to her house picks a mask goes down the hill no problem and I even make sure to get at least   feet away from her She picks up her dog says we can put the destroyed ball on her mom s check and we both head back to our respective houses     Now it is important to point out that this was only the second time I really interacted with this woman and the first one was when we she threw a party right when I had just come back from S o Paulo doing some volunteering at a hospital there  I ll just say I could not last long there  It s also very critical to point out that nobody is vaccinated yet and she know my fathers medical history pretty well     A few minutes after we get back this girl s mother calls saying that her daughter was threatened by my that I grabbed her and basically assaulted her I would not be too worried in many circumstances but the damn girl in a freaking lawyer with  month old baby  who did not deter her from partying like crazy of course and threatened to sue me for assault     And the worst part is my parents are now shouting at me saying that I m on my own and that the whole judicial system is geared against me and if there are expenses I ll have to find a job to pay it All because I DID NOT WANT MY FATHER DEAD     I m gonna be honest that I really want to move out and get on with in person school as soon as I possibly can Those friends who really know me know I could not hurt a damn bee if I wanted to  generally I just spend way too much time trying to get them to fly back through the window to safety   and now I m scared to death because I now that just an accusation like that regardless of court decision could haut me for the rest of my life According to my parents she won t bring charges or anything but I should not be so scared for my life just because of standing my ground and telling her to put on a mask during a fucking once in a hundred years pandemic that may I just remind you guys has killed more Americans than the entirety of WWII     I m just angry scared tired and just want to get back to working on telescopes and spacecraft like I was a year ago       If you guys have any advice I would greatly appreciate it I m just a young person and have never felt so scared of having been born with the wrong bits down there   If it helps I m based on the southernmost state of Brazil       Just to prove how non  alpha male I am the movie I was watching in Notting Hill  I know I know

MensRights,1613863315,A comment that I made to another post about the MRM vs Men s Liberation The men s rights movement was an inevitable and required pushback against feminism No ideology should be allowed to run unchecked  Think Nazi Germany and North Korea  A pushback is necessary to keep them from having absolute power or disaster ensues From a feminists perspective feminism was the inevitable and required pushback to the  patriarchy  I despise that term btw   Feminism wants to quash the patriarchy  I think that is pretty standard methodology for all feminism Even though the patriarchy doesn t exist but that s besides the point Did they expect that society would just give into all their demands without question That s where the MRM comes into play Men s Liberation lol This is a feminist construct to make it look like feminism is good for men It isn t Feminism isn t going to  liberate men Look at what feminism has done to due process and innocent until proven guilty Two of the pillars of modern democracy and the legal system No There is a response to every ideology  There has to be And the MRM is the required response Not Men s Liberation   And I m going to listen to the one that the ideology in question doesn t want you to hear Not the one that it does Because I m smarter than that

MensRights,1613961784, So I had a friend who got falsely accused of rape And I ve been thinking of this almost problem for a while but can you ever completely prove one received consent  It just seems like almost anything can be said to vitiate consent at any time But to me more accurate this is my example in words Let s say this guy does it all He asks the girl for verbal consent before he starts periodically he checks up on her to make sure the consent is still ongoing The girl is completely sober Etc etc  Then she goes and claims rape And her argument is yes I consented but I only did it out of fear as the man is a  ft      lb African American varsity athlete  Can one even argue against that The only argument I even see that could go against that would be arguing that one is not a physical threat And that seems impossible given the stats
MensRights,1613953187,While circumcision is an perfect example of male disposability effecting male children   there are also other examples of male disposability effecting male children too Like an example is that boys are more likely to get in trouble at schools than girls are even if the girl is misbehaving more than the boy is Also I heard that a study found that female teachers are likely to grade students tests lower when they knew the test taker was a boy And also in movies and in TV shows and in other forms of fiction male children are much more likely to be shown getting hurt or killed than female children are That really makes me mad since male children are just as vulnerable as female children are and they deserve the same protection and respect that they get

MensRights,1613937742,On the Ben Shapiro show there is a point where Ben talks about Harry Styles wearing a dress and complains about it At one point he talks about how a woman he knows admitted she would punch her husband for wearing something like that He treats this as perfectly okay This woman is objectively an abusive wife but Ben Shapiro is fine with that He says nothing even implying he has a problem with it On his sister s channel  Classically Abby she complains about the same thing and literally objectifies him claiming that he should stop wearing the dress because he doesn t find it fuckable This is literally a gender bent version of classic misogyny It didn t even occur to her that this is a questionable thing to say In fact multiple Republicans have expressed similar opinions It is perfectly normal among these people to tell men to change themselves to cater to their personal tastes The insistence on manly men is the same as the insistence on feminine women 
MensRights,1613931170,Hi so this is kinda a story analysis of the stuff that made me an MRA and my experiences with sexism Let s start from the beginning During my childhood my mother was emotionally manipulative and abusive towards me my sister and her husband As a kid I always felt like home was a potential war zone as we never knew when she was going to snap and start yelling and emotionally abusing us I never really had any connections as a kid and felt all alone  During my early school years I found it hard to make friends and was often sad I tended to be reserved and ungodly quiet It didn t help that much of the trauma from at home stuck with me throughout most of the day I would sometimes try to tell my teachers about how I didn t like seeing my mother so upset at my father  she primarily yelled at him but would also yell at me an my sister from time to time  and they would just say that that s what all parents do During my later years of school I did eventually make friends and opened up a bit more to others My mother still berated me and my family during this time During my middle school years and elementary school years I always felt inferior to the teachers  who were primarily female as well as the girls in my grade I think it was mostly due to my situation with my mother at home It still didn t help with my self esteem During high school I transferred school systems and I was back at having zero friends I was shy as usual and felt like an outsider During this time the modern wave of feminism was starting to creep in as well as the     election During high school many of the male degradation campaigns started to creep into the high school and lectures Also I was online a bit more and more of the things about how men are unable to know what pain is or are inherently inferior This is where some of my MRA attitudes came into play I knew that being treated as a lesser being was not right and I would not bow down to the women who were  constantly being oppressed and unable to be mean or abusive because I knew dang well that was a lie I had seen and felt firsthand how women could be abusive and that men had their own set of problems just like them During college is when it really took off I started college in      and this is when stuff was really getting out of hand for radical feminism and anti male propaganda While I  thankfully was never accused of assaulting or raping anyone it still didn t mean that my experience was positive During freshman orientation we were given a speech on sexual assault and rape Not once did they mention men being victims It also didn t help that I was very sexually inexperienced at this time unlike everyone else I didn t have a girlfriend or boyfriend since high school or right before college so some of the stuff they were saying about sexual assault and rape was new to me It was infuriating hearing a bunch of girls snarking on how anyone who hadn t heard of the stuff they were talking about was an idiot There was another talk less than a month later and it was similar in the fact that there was zero sympathy for men and zero mention of male victims As time wore on in college things kept getting worse with the university pushing for more female oriented talks about violence and sympathy It worsened my already bad anxiety and depression My two trips to the mental hospital didn t help either and I received little sympathy Anyways all this showed me that the modern  world did not care for the problems that men had It made me  and many on this sub feel like lesser people I do not hate women in the slightest and I don t blame them for everything wrong in my life In fact I support women s rights and wish them the best in life However I have no sympathy for misandrists and the ignorance of male suffering and demonizing of men as a whole TLDR Grew up with an abusive mother and school system that downplayed my experiences at home lead to severe depression and a rejection of modern anti male propaganda and modern feminism

MensRights,1613909846,I  m got into a debate with my friend  f who claimed there are no differences between men and women aside from physical strength and body parts My argument centered around behavioral differences and I made the point that on average men are more aggressive and interested in things and women are more agreeable and interested in people but there is more behavioral variance within each group then between This is why you see the most violent humans skew heavily male  She blamed all differences on externally driven forces like societal norms and felt male behavior is a result of how they are raised and what they are told they should be like rather than biologically driven forces  I m looking for more examples to prove my point that the majority of male female behavior is driven by biological forces One thing I remembered was car insurance is more expensive for men than women But that that could still be explained away by  external forces

MensRights,1614098969,I m sick and tired of this attitude  First marriage puts massive demands on a man  Feminism has demanded that women be released from their gender roles but men are still expected to adhere to theirs and more so than ever  You re expected to be a great provider by making lots of money  Then if you do and you get married any quick no fault divorce can swipe half of that wealth away from you plus possibly alimony and child support  For a man marriage is a great way to become financially destitute  So then if a man makes the rational decision to not participate in marriage society looks at him as some kind of creep  Who s life is it anyway  You can either get married and have those huge demands put on you and likely be destroyed financially and emotionally or you can opt out and receive a heaping helping of social stigma as unmarried men are constantly suspected of being up to no good  If you even look at someone the wrong way you re assumed to be some kind of child molester   I m so tired of all this crap I d rather live alone in a cabin in the woods and spend my days reading or canoeing on the nearby lake  Maybe I could write some stories on a manual typewriter  But being stuck in corporate America and simply expected to earn a lot and support a woman   that sucks  I m sick of it  I don t understand why any man would take the massive risk that is marriage

MensRights,1614083654,Currently I m a    year old guy and am in a much better place than I used to be when I was falsely accused of rape and sexually assaulting this girl in school and thankfully things didn t get out of hand for me during the whole situation and I got away from it relatively quickly   So this story occurred  and a half years ago when I was in school   I was always the quiet kid in school unless I was around people I was very comfortable with I was an above average but not a superb student I was in the school band and in the school table tennis team  and most of the band members were a part of the table tennis team we were almost always together and represented my school till the state level once   I was a pretty reputed student around the school and was considered as one of the nice kids who were kind always submitted homework before time worked hard in school projects and most of the teachers  who didn t teach me as well knew me pretty well   I wasn t socially great but still recognized well throughout the school   So in  th grade a week after the midterm examination we were having a PE lecture after which we had our recess I spent all of that time  one hour for PE and   minutes in recess with my friends all of us played table tennis together and then ate our lunch together  in the class our class teacher was in the class as well  right after the recess during lectures I was called by one of the peons saying that I was called by the principal   I ve never been called by the principal outside of a couple of situations where they called me and my table tennis team just to talk and congratulate us for doing well but I ve never been called alone   so I was a bit confused   while going to the principal s office the peon gave me many weird disgusted looks which I didn t know why he did so at the time   I enter the principal s office to see a girl crying with her hands over her face  I don t recognize her and the principal looking at me with a VERY angry look   I ask what s going on she tells me to shut up and said  what you did is completely disgusting you don t deserve to be on this school premises and I am considering suspending you for this which really caught me off guard cuz she s never spoken to me like that before   I ask again what happened and she tells me in a very condescending manner  oh so you don t know what you did just a few minutes ago  to which I replied that I was eating food with my friends in class   and then she asks the girl to tell everyone her story again    Back story of the girl she s a student from the other class and she s one of the entitled girls who wasn t that super popular but still had many friends she apparently had a crush on me and she asked me out a few weeks before the midterm exams to which I rejected her very respectfully telling her that I wasn t looking for any form of relationship nor am I interested in dating anyone and it was nothing against her her story mentioned that during PE class I went to the  th floor where she was and while she was going to the washroom I followed her and went into the washroom right behind her and also then manage to keep her quiet with my hands pull down my pants and rape her for   minutes and then leave her in the washroom floor and back to where ever I was   and I was devastated on listening to the story cuz I ve never even thought of doing this to ANY woman I know  or even not know and I would never wish it upon anyone ever   I immediately started stuttering and struggling to speak cuz I was still trying to interpret what she said I kept trying to say that I was with my friends the whole time struggling to say anything and mumbling most of the things almost on the verge of tears the principal then threatens to call my parents and I get very scared cuz they re very abusive to me and I don t know what they would do to me even after I was proven innocent I kept repeating that I was with my friends the whole time to which then the principal  said  okay then call your friends I want to hear from them and I ll be checking CCTV footage of where you were  my friends were called and the principal had the footage of my class the  th floor corridor and the table tennis room pulled out cuz those were the places I either was or claimed to have been there  I was in the table tennis room during PE and in my classroom during recess I was playing table tennis with my friends during the time period the girl specified and my friends also testified for the fact that I was with them the whole time and even my class teacher was called and she testified for me too   it was clearly visible that I was innocent and that I didn t do anything remotely close to what she said and then the girl says that all my friends were in on it my teacher was in on it too and started saying more and more lies and tries to maneuver her way out of the situation   my friends and I were told to leave the room and we did so too   I couldn t sleep for a couple of days after that cuz I was so scared because of the whole situation and thought that I would be treated like a rapist put in jail thrown out from my school my parents would disown me and a lot of other thoughts   a couple of weeks later after the whole situation I m told that I ve been from the table tennis team and won t be allowed to represent my school in any form of competition ever again I was also from the school band the girl was told almost nothing other than the fact that she had to go through an hour or so long lecture from the principal she still told her lies to all of her friends and many other teachers even though I had proved my innocence within mere minutes of being accused I was treated like a criminal in school my friends spoke to me less as well cuz they didn t want to be painted as a  rapist s friend  and I don t blame em for that I got bullied a whole lot more than I used to be my teachers would be more sarcastic towards me everyone gave me the looks and made the last year and a half of school a living hell for me   thankfully these topics were never brought up to my parents in any way and my teachers didn t bring it up to my parents during the parent teacher meetings though they were passive aggressive during em overall   it was a really rough time for me cuz I was treated like an outcast it made me go into depression and get into self harm telling myself that I was actually a rapist beating myself up for rejecting the girl even having suicidal thoughts and considering that life just wasn t of any use anymore everyone would treat me like this even after school was done   it made me miserable   but I m glad I hang on to dear life then   after school was over everything was a lot better for me   since the whole situation never got out of the school  cuz the school didn t share it basically shut it down to keep their own reputation high as well and since I ve gotten into college I ve gotten away from the whole story and it isn t a tag attached to me anymore   nowadays I always keep my distance from all the women I know surrounding myself with people who could testify for me staying around CCTV cameras at all times so that I can prove my location at any time   and I really suggest you all do so too   never having girls as friends ever again   I was reminded of this story today cuz of a nightmare I had with a very similar story   and just wanted to vent about it and also spread awareness that just stay away from women and surround yourself with trustable people    gt Note I won t be sharing the names of the girl principal peon teachers myself or my school in the comments or anywhere to maintain my own privacy you all are completely in your right to doubt or question this

MensRights,1614066325,The inability to cooperate with others and consider others perspectives is key in narcissistic personality disorder very often as I hear people discussing attributes held by a man said to be narcissistic I think  that sounds fairly common among women   I have come to the conclusion that feminist talking points are specifically engineered to disguise toxic feminine narcisism as righteous indignation  As an example of what I am talking about I draw your attention to  Second to last paragraph of this post   OP said Roommate was  tearing down other women because she  at an appropriate time place and  on   asked OP to be a bit more modest when Roommate had company over the whole rhetorical method of representing such a respectful request as an attack makes it so OP can ignore how she imposes on Roommate and focus ONLY on how Roommate s polite request was an imposition on her what do you think Does feminism disguise and buttress narcissism Is it a coincidental function of dogmas created with no regard to it or am I seeing links that are not present

MensRights,1614422284,Linkedin Study    amp  x   B This LinkedIn study from     used their internal data to examine differences between men and women when job searching Among the key findings are the fact that men and women view a similar number of jobs though women apply to    fewer A recruiter is    more likely to view a man s profile which she described as result of a problematic bias that must be corrected  even though they also found that recruiters will still contact both genders at equal rates  However the author  Maria Ignatova makes no effort to hide her own bias  and sexism by writing  gt The good news is that when women do apply to a job they are    more likely than men to get hired In fact if the role is more senior than their current position that number goes up to        gt    gt While this is an uplifting stat it does show that women do a very thorough job at vetting roles  sometimes maybe too thorough If women only apply when they feel extremely qualified this could also indicate they are not pursuing stretch opportunities Linkedin is a mainstream website not a fringe feminist blog Yet blatant discrimination in hiring practices is celebrated as  good news and as  uplifting stat s   This doesn t lead to equality it s just another piece of evidence that equality isn t the actual goal Her analysis is also very weak and uses the usual strategy of reframing all issues so that women are the real victims I think a more plausible hypothesis for why men apply to    more jobs is because if we are getting rejected more often then we need to submit more applications to increase our chances of finding work Of course I would submit fewer if I was getting offers at       higher rate For most of us this is just seeing statistics that support what we already knew is happening The worst part is just being gaslit and told this is  equality and if we have a problem with it we are misogynist or examples of  toxic masculinity  I just wonder how far it will continue to go

MensRights,1614393381,After doing lots of research on the topic of circumcision and other forms of genital cutting I have identified a clear double standard that I would like to talk about and address here There are forms of FGM today that are less invasive than male circumcision such as the  ritual nick which are criminalized illegal and seen as a severe human rights violation and yet the more severe male procedure is legal and not frowned upon as such  Davis        writes      federal and state laws criminalizing genital alteration on female minors are so broad that they cover even procedures   significantly less substantial  than newborn male circumcision       a complete laissez faire attitude toward one practice coupled with total criminalization of the other runs afoul of the    free exercise   clause of the First Amendment There are also troubling implications for the constitutional requirement of   equal protection  because the laws appear to protect little girls but not little boys from religious and culturally motivated surgery   Arora et al        wrote in a paper published in  The British Journal of Medical Ethics    Male circumcision is legal in USA and tolerated in most of the world even when done by non medical practitioners in the home Yet comparable or less radical procedures in women are deemed misogynistic and human rights violations      the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics as well as WHO have labelled all forms of FGA as a human rights violation as it violates  bodily integrity in the absence of any medical benefit and victimises vulnerable girls However male circumcision is also a procedure that violates bodily integrity and up to recently was thought not to have justifiable medical benefit but was instead tolerated due to religious and cultural freedom and the lack of long term harm   Earp        also noted   There are now legally prohibited forms of medically unnecessary female genital cutting including the so called ritual nick that are   less severe  than permitted forms of medically unnecessary male and intersex genital cutting  He also writes about the differences in  khatna  which is the genital cutting procedures practiced for both sexes in Islam The male procedure is more severe and yet completely legal whereas the female procedure is criminal in all   states and treated as a  mutilation    The Bohras practice what they call  khatna  an Arabic word for circumcision  on both girls and boys within their community   In the female case  a pinch of skin is typically cut or from the clitoral hood often leaving no visible sign of alteration In the male case the entire penile foreskin is leaving an unmistakably altered sexual organ According to the ruling by Friedman discussed in the previous section the less severe female procedure is already illegal in all   states as a criminal assault It might seem then that the more severe male procedure must also be a criminal assault In fact that has been a dominant view among legal scholars who have addressed the issue since      However the male procedure continues to be treated as legal regardless of jurisdiction including in its more dangerous forms  The double standards don t stop there There is a procedure that ultra Orthodox Jews perform called  metzizah b peh which is an ancient unhygienic form of male circumcision where the  mohel  traditional circumciser tears the immature foreskin from the penile glans typically without pain control and then takes the baby s penis into his mouth to staunch the blood and supposedly  cleanse the wound This has been known to have caused many cases of herpes and led to two cases of serious brain damage and two deaths in one year alone Not only is this practice not treated as illegal it isn t even regulated City officials ultimately dropped even an informal plan to require that parents sign a consent  form   However any forms of female genital cutting including ones done in sterilized and anesthetized manners are seen as illegal and criminal   full stop   Now some might respond with something to the degree of  Circumcision has health benefits whereas FGM has none  Well the question I would ask is  If it was demonstrated that FGM had health benefits would you concede your position that it is a moral wrong  Presumably not and this is merely a moral red herring If so then you might have to be prepared to give up your view as some health benefits have also been noted for FGM in many scholarly sources For example there has been found  a lower risk of vaginal cancer  fewer infections from microbes gathering under the hood of the clitoris and protection against herpes and genital ulcers    Source      Source     Moreover at least  two studies   by Western scientists  have shown   a negative correlation between female genital cutting and HIV The authors of one of the studies both seasoned statisticians who expected to find the opposite relationship described their findings as a  significant and perplexing inverse association between reported female circumcision and HIV seropositivity  Again no one would ever consider making FGM legal on the basis of these potential prophylactic health benefits I would also like to bring to your attention something known as  cosmetic female genital cutting which typically consists of medically unnecessary procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other alterations to the female genital organs for perceived cosmesis widely practiced in Western countries and generally considered acceptable if performed with the informed consent of the individual These consist of the   same  procedures that are typically classified as FGM Given that there is overlap  or a close anatomical parallel between each form of WHO de ned  mutilation and Western style  cosmetic female genital cutting neither of which is medically necessary one must ask what the widely perceived categorical moral difference is between these two sets of procedures Controlling for clinical context varies across the two sets and is often functionally similar the most promising candidate for such a difference appears to be the   typical age   and hence   presumed    or likely consent status   of the subject But if that is correct it is not ultimately the degree of invasiveness  which ranges widely across both sets of practices  speci c tissues affected or the precise medical or non medical bene t to risk pro le of medically unnecessary  female genital cutting that is most central to determining its perceived moral acceptability Rather it is the extent to which the affected individual desires the genital cutting and can consent to it This suggests that the core of the putative rights violation is the   lack of consent  regarding a medically unnecessary intervention into one s sexual anatomy This consideration applies regardless of the sex or gender of the non consenting person Thanks for reading

MensRights,1614703389,  that is the link to the evidence that askfeminists is sexist
MensRights,1614700612,In the     s feminists attempted to create a false etymology for the phrase   rule of thumb    It was claimed that husbands used to be able to beat their wives so long as they used a stick or a whip no thicker than their thumb This is of course not true and the real etymology for the phrase comes from a practice of using the length or width of your thumb as a unit of measure You d be surprised just how many people believe this to be true though  The idea that men could legally beat their wives is a cornerstone of feminist dogma that they ve tried to push for decades  The evidence for this practice however is basically non existent  There are a couple court cases from the     s where men have seemingly gotten away with hitting their wives but it has never actually been a legal practice under US law or under English common law And even those court cases that some feminists try to cite seem fairly lackluster In one such case the husband was found innocent due to a lack of bruising or marks on his wife  Which feminists try to interpret as  it was fine so long as you didn t beat your wife too severely   Even if such a husband did get away with hitting his wife clearly it was still a crime since it was prosecuted And the reason he was found innocent came down to a lack of evidence not because there was a misogynistic loophole that he took advance of   Other court cases ruled on interpretations of English common law which is taken to help legitimize the idea that some form of wife abuse used to be legal However those court rulings consistently found insufficient evidence to justify an exception including for cases of  mild discipline of your wife   Which if anything seems like evidence against this not in favor of it Domestic violence wasn t explicitly outlawed in the US at a federal level until the early     s which is another talking point you see about this But it was still illegal at the state level going back to the     s And would have also been illegal under regular assault laws This is because there weren t any legal exceptions granted to husbands to assault their wives the way feminists like to say there were Even more damning is that wife abuse  but not husband abuse carried with it very cruel and unusual punishments throughout most of history  Under one law a husband accused of beating his wife would be buried with just his head left above the ground so that his wife could do whatever she wanted to him in retribution In fact it was actually husband abuse not wife abuse that used to be legal in history  Under some laws a wife was not only allowed to beat her husband but if she did it was used as evidence that the husband had actually done something wrong and needed to be punished  even more   The assumption is that he had to have done something to piss her off bad enough to hit him  And him making her mad but not her hitting him out of anger was deemed to be a crime  Under some versions of this law the punishment for making your wife angry enough to hit you included being drug throughout town by horses The expectation both socially and legally was that husbands were supposed to be subservient to their wives not the other way around So not only is this feminist view lacking in evidence but the very opposite of it seems to have been true   Here is a source I ve been using for this for a while       The  Great Taboo and the Role of Patriarchy in Husband and Wife Abuse   Full text   Not only does it go into the background of this controversy the authors analyzed a bunch of papers that claim that wife abuse used to be legal to show that their citation trails basically go nowhere  The only legitimate primary source is something written in the     s by Sir William Blackstone an English judge He claimed that someone told him that you could use moderate discipline on your wife at some distant point in the past but even he couldn t find a reference to it in older law books He then went on to say that such a thing would be obviously illegal in modern times  meaning in     s England   Thus apparently refuting the claim in the very source that is commonly cited as evidence for it  Modern historians have of course found no evidence for this either Like a lot of things you come across in the context of gender and gender equality I was expecting this to be fairly unknown outside of the men s community  Obviously there are academic references but just because you have sources doesn t mean it s widely known about On a whim I decided to check out Wikipedia just to see how this was handled there  And I was surprised to find that not only was this mentioned as a myth but the article itself went into a good bit of detail over the history of this revisionist claim   Clearly there s been a bit of  debate that s played out on this page given the length of discussion that s afforded to this just in the intro section  where it goes back and forth with a few feminist talking points sprinkled in here or there  But ultimately the facts have prevailed What I found interesting is just how much time energy and money feminists have put into making this seem like a legitimate fact  To quote Wikipedia  gt In the   th century public concern with the problem of domestic violence declined at first and then re emerged along with the resurgent feminist movement in the     s    The first recorded link between wife beating and the phrase  rule of thumb appeared in      in a report on domestic violence by women s rights advocate Del Martin  gt  gt For instance the common law doctrine had been modified to allow the husband  the right to whip his wife provided that he used a switch no bigger than his thumb  a rule of thumb so to speak     gt While Martin appears to have meant the phrase  rule of thumb only as a figure of speech some feminist writers treated it as a literal reference to an earlier law        The following year a book on battered women stated  gt  gt One of the reasons nineteenth century British wives were dealt with so harshly by their husbands and by their legal system was the  rule of thumb  Included in the British Common Law was a section regulating wifebeating      The new law stipulated that the reasonable instrument be only  a rod not thicker than his thumb  In other words wifebeating was legal      gt Despite this erroneous reading of the common law  which is a set of judicial principles rather than a written law with individual sections the spurious legal doctrine of the  rule of thumb was soon mentioned in a number of law journals       The myth was repeated in a     report by the United States Commission on Civil Rights on domestic abuse titled  Under the Rule of Thumb  as well as a later United States Senate report on the Violence Against Women Act     gt In the late   th century some efforts were made to discourage the phrase  rule of thumb     which was seen as taboo owing to this false origin    Patricia T O Conner former editor of the  New York Times Book Review described it as  one of the most persistent myths of political correctness     During the     s several authors wrote about the false etymology of  rule of thumb  including the conservative social critic Christina Hoff Sommers    who described its origin in a misunderstanding of Blackstone s commentary     Nonetheless the myth persisted in some legal sources into the early     s    There are other myths floating around out there as well  For example it is often said that you could beat your wife on certain days of the week or in certain locations  commonly the courthouse steps on Sunday  Despite being widely repeated and endorsed by feminists as near as I can tell that one is a myth also   So why make these efforts to rewrite history And what does it say about your ideology that you have to make things up to help legitimatize it This isn t the only area that feminists have engaged in historical revisionism  Other examples include the nature of coverture under English common law  a type of marriage  the treatment of women as literal slaves to men and of course the history of the movement itself   First wave feminism and  second wave feminism weren t actually older incarcerations of feminism Most of those people didn t call themselves feminists and they definitely wouldn t have agreed with modern feminist ideology However a great deal of time and effort has been made to appropriate their accomplishments under the banner of feminism The good news is that a lot more attention has been given to this recently  Sources are easier to come by and there have even been a couple books written by impartial historians about this  including at least one book  The Privileged Sex  where the author went in to it under the assumption that women were oppressed and was surprised to find just how incorrect of a view that is  Facts can t be hidden forever  You can try to rewrite history all you want but people are going to find the truth when they actually go looking for it

MensRights,1614852498,  This is a long post and I didn t add tl dr because I need to explain everything briefly I am sorry for no tl dr but discussing these issues are very important to understand and help men s mental issues   We all know that a man s status can differ They can be working class they can be white collar working class they can be rich or they can be middle class Yet the society not only compare men within their socio economic class but also compare men within different classes a  cross class comparement At the end the measurement will be done by looking at two things How much the men earns and how many partners they get You can achieve something great scientifically you will be headlines for once Eventually if you can t turn it into huge money or investment you will be forgotten  This is not only done by men but women also values men based on these things After all we are a society and every gender is part of the society they live in   This is a huge problem Men who can barely sustain their life plus not getting laid are suicidal Yes They feel weak worthless and complete failures Men who can sustain their life can cope a little while men who can sustain their life and get married without divorce can also cope enough Marriage is somehow viewed as a  success by society even by most progressive ones Somehow marrying resets your past mistakes and you are baptised by marriage The man gets a life long partner so he must be succesful that s one of the highest levels of success for working class men If they can manage to avoid huge debts may be buying a house with debt or mortgage get their children in school and get them jobs and marriages they will reach their peak level of success  Now of course if their children can get into middle class that will be beyond their realistic goals Anyways My point is to feel successful secure worthful and complete a men has sets of tasks given to them by society To be worthy you need to complete them Each men according to their socio economic class has different sets of tasks And all link to earning money and getting laid We all know incels or heard about them If we break down their psychology or  lonely man psychology in general we can find that most lonely man even if they are surrounded by people can t feel  complete  They lack the satisfaction We humans have an evolutionary response for loneliness or not accepted by society depression This feeling is a defence mechanism of body to stop doing acts that secludes them from society Still if you are successful at work and have a social life but can t get satisfacted for varying reasons you will feel lonely And this loneliness eventually lead to depression Yes Getting laid won t make you more men and not getting laid won t make you a lesser men I did have many partners and girlfriends but it shouldn t be the main focus of our lives I see many young men feel bad for not being able to get a girlfriend That shouldn t bother you but the system and society wants you to feel bad It is designed in that way and our one of the first struggle shall be against these norms Men shouldn t be valued by how much they earn and how many partners they can find Also we all know what this means To get more money you either need to be rich because money attracts money or you need to get in a good earning job Otherwise like if you are the clerk at McDonalds cashier you are doomed And to get partners our today s society is very  lookist  I see many men being rejected because of them being at medium or short height or not being very well looking Money can cover up all of them but if you don t have money then your look really matters The system doesn t only forces men They also make women think they are worthless unless they get the best partner for themselves Like I said before the society is not made up by a single gender and both gender are victims of this system and society This is why we all dream about a united struggle a solidarity where men and women fight for their worth and rights against the system  Now let s talk about reasons of these problems in a very summarized way   Reasons    To breakdown these reasons societal norms are not enough to explain everything The capitalistic world where there is an illusion of choice freedom and  competition  makes everything worse There is no denying that capitalism uses every method to ensure it s own safety profit and presence and has no shame into destroying lives souls and environment in the process There is no freedom of choice but we are raised to believe that we have Getting different unhealthy snacks from supermarkets is not freedom of choice We don t have freedom after all we can t get in the hermit life just like that Ensuring survival and living in harmony with nature is near impossible in today s world The most brutal truth about it was colonisation of Africa You can never be left alone in any corner of the world And finally the illusion of  competition        There is no competition We  compete with each other to be best servants of their system They don t want you to start up your own small business and live peacefully They want everything to serve in their economic mechanism that allows them to earn most and be the dominant class If you can get into their chamber you are welcome Otherwise we are all equally piece of shits and will be treated in that way We will compete with each other harm each other block each other or even plot against each other So only the ones who can serve better will rank up And most of us I mean almost none of us will be CEO of McDonalds who earns millions of dollars per year   And men are also got into the plastic surgery trap This is a market and it targeted women first They made women feel inferior and worthless when they weren t just like celebrities they presented Celebrities are one of the aristocratic establishments of capitalism Their main task is to set up the standards for society and make it look like those standards are mere average Being       It s just average They don t even get any plastic surgery    they just drink lots of water Yes they targeted women first like I said Women who felt worthless because they couldn t meet these standards of course tried plastic surgery so they could feel better It s not their fault and we should be fair about it because sometimes I see people blaming women for these stuffs It s not their fault  Now men are being targeted by this beauty market Buy products to look handsome Get your nose and chin done Get some more jawline Because outlook and money are all that matters Nothing else has any meaning in todays society and we are both slaves and consumerists of the system Thanks for reading I hope we can help our fellow brothers with their mental issues We should encourage them We should tell them that not getting laid or not earning much is totally ok They need to find things that they love in this world and get on the track Don t let the system and society ruin everything It is a fight against the world designed to make us suffer and we are all veterans of this war 
MensRights,1614851959,Also if you vote for a wave  that does not mean you agree with everything they advocated for or did  it just means you support the wave as a whole  meaning if you were there at that time  you would support it Also this isn t a feminist poll  I am a MRA  View Poll  
MensRights,1614830393,First incident was when I was    I was trying to be friendly with a kid out in public and his Mom grabbed him away and gave me the filthiest look ever  Now I know to most people that would seem like a harmless minor incident that should be ignored But think about the implication I was just labeled as a PEDOPHILE And another time was when my friend brought his girlfriend over and she d keep getting annoyed uncomfortable every time I looked in her direction And then I had to consciously divert my gaze away from her and now think about where I was looking  And I was once walking out in the street at night and this girl walking in front of me burst out into a run and starting running forwards  And during university there were a couple of girls who d actively avoid me  I once offered a seat next to me to one of them and they ignored me and walked to the other side of the classroom  All because I was an introvert who wasn t outgoing Girls don t like reserved quiet guys  unless they re Robert Pattison   I know to most people these might seem like minor harmless issues But my self esteem is nowhere near as pristine as it was when I was a   year old All of these years of   women trying to be safe   has  damaged my self esteem And I know I m not the only one a lot of men have endured this  I used to know another guy with Aspergers who would always avoid women because he was afraid of   creeping them out    
MensRights,1614825132,E Oops Male sexuality that is attracted to women in some form that is   Disclaimer   I didn t feel like making a million fucking  sarcasm quotation marks apply them as necessary while reading lol This is hypocrisy in the purest form they use old anti porn feminist arguments and logic when dealing with issues that relate to female sexualization through the male gaze and call it objectifying and dehumanizing and yet they switch over to sex positive arguments and logic when it comes to their own sexualization and self objectification insisting that it is healthy or even empowering when a woman chooses to do it regardless of the circumstances or context The issue is that those anti porn arguments are fundamentally sexist and sex negative against women they imply that women are inherently demeaned by their own sexuality relative to a male s Yet this sexist logic that concludes women are sexually inferior to men is allowed to be weaponized against us and to shame our own natural biology without implying anything negative towards women They will assert that they are being sexualized in ways that are inherently sexist that sexuality itself isn t the problem it is because we view them as sexual objects but this is nothing but bullshit assumptions A woman being objectified is seen as more harmful than a man because of the implied sexual shame for women Women were primarily valued for their looks femininity and domestic role long before the sexual revolution ever took place Now just to clarify I want to express that my issue is that they simply twist their ideology to benefit themselves at every turn I am against the ludicrous double standard that this represents I am not in favor of shaming men or women for sex just because we have different biology I want to create a more sex positive and equal society apparently much more so than feminists do Feminists want to hide behind their victim status when it is convenient and put unnecessary suffering onto men in the process I can t express how fucking insane it is that their whole theory of objectification is widely accepted despite being a mess of contradictions 
MensRights,1614804882,I don t know how I managed to last as long as I did but I ve made the decision to leave the r Feminism subreddit I was always thinking  Yeah but not all men  and often felt that I was being indirectly attacked with the broad sexist generalisations  One specific post was along the lines of  All men benefit from sexism  All men are sexist  All men unknowingly or knowingly participate in sexism Its rather humorous and mind blowing that some of them are so indoctrinated in their one sided ideology that they don t  or do realise they are perpetuating the same evil they claim they are fighting against  I wanted to learn about the oppression and struggles women face in every day life not be demonized for being a man I hope there are some subreddits that purely focus on that and not the persistent  man bashing

MensRights,1614789596,while I dont think this is an injustice or unfair it is important to men s rights and feelings  amp  x   B when boys go into puberty and start looking for more mature content they will pop into those YouTubers who do low effort Reddit videos and reaction videos but they will show off cleavage this in itself is not an issue and younger boys seeing this is also not a big deal but I feel they should understand what is happening you know that they are feeling arousal or attraction to said YouTubers but they don t know that and whether this is predatory and manipulative is another topic altogether you see I fell into this trap of not understanding why I watched these YouTubers because at the time I was watching another more interesting and understandable Reddit YouTuber who made real content I did not understand the feelings I felt towards these YouTubers and I think that that isn t good I also see my younger brother finding these YouTubers and I think that boys should have the information to understand what is happening also some personal things are happening with my brother that are very personal and I will not share even though you guys have had the same thing also mods if you don t like can you direct me to a place where the mods will like this post   amp  x   B TLDR younger boys entering puberty are attracted to female YouTubers who show off their bodies  and that s fine of course but they don t understand and they also go through personal changes they won t understand until captain hindsight tells them I feel that boys should understand these changes

MensRights,1614775195,Not sure have this happened anywhere else but here it was a thing for my understanding it did not go trough but it was far off either Actually all these crazy things have happened after meetoo campaign and i know a lot of people who are not trusting women at all any more because of this Like how it would be a crime if women regrets it After it all have happened It is not rape if she was okay with it Even i have regretted one night stands but i never have even tought about that nonsense
MensRights,1615234513,With the Formula W series where no men are allowed now becoming an official support category for Formula   I wonder what the world would think about a Formula M Series with no women allowed  In motorsports after all there is no need for a women and men only category like in other sports because the car is    of what you can do as a driver 
MensRights,1615232980,So basically I was a temp at this job and there was a woman there who seemed a little interested in me as something more than a friend I do have above average looks so I m not too unfamiliar with this happening to me But I had a girlfriend and this woman coworker of mine was   years older than me at the time and divorced Anyways I got to know her over the weeks and one day she invited me to her house for dinner I accepted because she had been very nice to me and I know she s a good cook When I got there she gave me a glass of wine which was laced with some kind of roofie that made me become something of a vegetable but still conscious After about half an hour the roofie kicked in and she started with the raping When she was done she also took what I can only assume was another roofie because she laid down on the floor and soon she was in the same state that I was A couple hours later I started being able to move fully again and I left while she was sleeping probably high as fuck  I decided not to be a pussy about that and on Monday I talked to my female boss who just sat there and smiled and sometimes giving me the  are you stupid enough to think I ll believe that  look while I told her this story I wasn t too emotionally scarred by the incident itself honestly my biggest concern was that my girlfriend might find out and dump me But after I had told my story I could tell my boss was about to start laughing but she said she would talk with my rapist about this Her office had glass walls and I was looking into that room and could see my rapist crying I though that she had been fired and that was the end of that But no I get called back into my boss s office and she locked the door when I got in Then she told me that she had called the police and that I were to wait in her office until they arrived to take me away for rape  Fast forward a bit and I m in jail and no one believed my story Not the interrogation officer not the arresting officer and not even my family and friends The only one that believed me was my girlfriend and her parents Luckily they were rich and could afford a good lawyer  I also had the luck to get a fair judge and jury who eventually gave me a non guilty verdict Now what did the rapist get who drugged me with an illegal substance before raping me A promotion and a TV interview about speaking up against rape What did I get Kicked out of my apartment fired from my job and probably have little to no hope to get a good job in the future Life of  a man everybody Never the victim   
MensRights,1615232499,In honor of international women s day I would like to post some of my conclusions following several years of research on feminism men s rights and the gender war   What group is primarily hurt by the division of men and women resulting in the fragmentation of the family It is the lower classes who depend upon the cooperation of individuals who are primarily hurt by any loss of social cohesion The more money a person has at their disposal the more insulated that individual is from the effects of social deterioration They can simply purchase what they need and throw money at any problems that come their way The less money you have the more you need the cooperation of others for survival even more so to thrive  The upper classes have a long history of using social issues to fragment the lower classes one prominent example is the widespread use of race baiting on syndicated news programs who despite any claims to the contrary serve as nothing more than mouthpieces of the ruling economic elites Multinational corporate support of feminism serves this function and any divide in the family hits at the heart of the functionality of the working class as anything more than simple wage slaves a condition that corporate interests require to maintain a philosophy of endless growth   What group benefits primarily from the division of men and women resulting in the fragmentation of the family Since the rise of feminism the average wage of the working class adjusted for inflation has stagnated  if not dropped  At the same time the productivity of multinational corporations has steadily increased to the point that certain individuals in the economic elite have as much money if not more than the federal government At the same time social programs that benefit the working class have been systematically cut things like school funding welfare programs social security and unemployment insurance  all providing valuable safety nets and resources  in order to fund systematic cuts to the taxes paid by these individuals and institutions So long as they are divided against each other along the lines of race and gender the lower classes cannot mount an effective defense against the squeeze With this ungodly wealth the elites now have at their disposal it is an easy thing to buy off the government to turn a blind eye to their enslaving usurious practices From the legalization of corruption through citizen s united to the outright theft of elections the government is now their strong arm  From this we can clearly see what feminism is an ideology co opted by multinational corporations and the economic elite to hobble the working class and strong arm them into perpetual wage slavery in order to maintain a philosophy of unlimited growth So MRA s Don t expect the government to support you Don t expect wealthy corporations to support you When you fight for men s rights you are not just fighting for men s rights but also against their will to power Expect  resistance Expect to be vilified You are what they fear most men standing in unity

MensRights,1615231190,Hello I recently posted here that I  a   year old teenager support the Mens Rights Movement I want to be more active on this subreddit and voice my opinion as the communuty here seems welcoming and isn t mad at all I support gender equality for both men and women and it s wrong that women  and men too but women do it more statisticly speaking are treated better and get away with more stuff than men Anyways my post Correct me if I m wrong but in order for a female to  produce  a man would need to fertilize the egg Without men it would be impossible to fertilize the egg and both women and men would both go extinct So why do some women hate men when we are part of the reason they exist  
MensRights,1615230345,More often than not when I point out to people that the wage gap can be almost completely explained by job choices overtime work hours etc I get told that women are forced out of work to care for children because it is what society expects of them How would you counter such an arguement If you use sources which ones would you use

MensRights,1614896742,I m new to this sub but after being severely abused by two romantic partners in my life I ve become much more personally involved with men s rights I might get into it in future posts but here s my current concern     Just now on facebook I saw a post telling us to teach men to not normalize touching women s waists as you pass them by I ve never personally done this or felt a need and of course touching someone like that shouldn t be accepted but I ve become admittedly jaded Yes I agree it shouldn t be done but the wording of the post came off as bigoted and demonizing to men I immediately thought what about all the women I ve known that say  excuse me once and then proceed to push the man out of the way before he even has time to react It s not just they they push past them they do it aggressively What I observe is that the specific women who do this enter the situation expecting to be disrespected The last time I saw this was at a bar and a man was standing talking to a group of friends The woman said excuse me and he obviously didn t hear her simple as that She perceived it as him purposefully ignoring disrespecting her and proceeded to elbow him out of the way No one said anything no one did anything They allowed it to happen and let her get away with it without consequence To me this normalizes it because the woman who got away with it leaves the situation feeling as if she s in the right because no one told her it was wrong    It s funny to me because society views men as the aggressors but in my experience most of the aggression and hostility I ve experienced has come from women Now obviously I m not saying this to diminish violence women have experienced I m simply describing something men experience and nothing more In hindsight I see men being physically pushed around a lot concerts bars and subways to name a few It s not necessarily an every day occurrence but it happens enough that I notice it and no one seems to care enough to speak out about it  Has anyone else noticed this trend I know for a fact I wouldn t appreciate being elbowed and I sure as hell am not out to disrespect anyone If I don t move it s because I didn t hear you 
MensRights,1614890763,So me and my friend had a discussion today  We focused on US and excluded third world countries as women have it worse there It was about the topic if there should also be a month dedicated to men I was on the side that there should be to not create a toxic gap between both of the genders to bring awareness to mens problems as well Whether it would be sort of awareness month or just mens history month or something of this sort My friend however said that men don t deserve this kind of a thing As they didn t suffer enough compared to women My points were divorce cases men being forced to go to war false abuse or rape accusations suicide rates or just how media don t cover as much of the problems that men face as women do Over time it went from talking about if there should be a month like that to an argument of whether men s issues are equal to female issues It got to the point where there were  sides Mine Both genders issues should be treated equally and we should aspire to solve both of them My friends We should prioritise women issues over mens I said that we should be prioritising both genders problems as postponing the other genders problems would only make society root from the inside But I guess having this opinion makes me an incel Guess we should only focus on female problems and ignore the struggles that males have to face in the current day   Take into consideration it could be biased from my side as we both got frustrated at each other that argument   So what do you think  Edit I just wanted to say this because its been stressing me today Im allowed to study online or in person I study online and my friend studies in person We had the discussion on a discord call I just don t want rumours of me being an incel spreading and me not being able to do anything

MensRights,1615236949,I know this is a small move and I will keep using other google services but I will boycott Google search engine and Chrome app because of the double standards in Woman s Day and Man s Day I understand that women s rights were more of an urgence and it was a bigger development because women were more oppressed but using double standards is nothing different from what used to happen to women  I also encourage you to take the same action with me If we start a movement we can make them hear our voice For the thousands of men being subjected to double standards in courts schools and the social life I didn t make a research about that so maybe there was already a movement like that Then please let me know about it Also it will be nice if you add any suggestions

MensRights,1615378119,Just like sperm banks changed culture and power dynamics in society so will artificial incubation when it becomes commercially available   It will give men the ability to reproduce without women and will free women up to work more and be more productive for society without wasting time with  months of pregnancy or raising kids   The result In all honesty it will be negative for both men and women but especially women we all know how utilitarian policy makers and corporate leaders can be out there   but it will be especially affect women negatively in a way that will make the middle ages look progressive   I don t think either side realizes this   but establishing true unity and true equality and equal treatment is more important now than ever   for women s sakes as much as men I feel this is going right over many people s heads on reddit and in contemporary discourse 
MensRights,1615377013,Hey lads first time caller long time listener here  As the title says I fell down a reddit rabbit hole found  r superstraight and I m interested to hear if anyone s been watching this and what thoughts they had if any I followed it for a couple of days and  whew I m happy to be off the wild ride now I think the sub has been shut down as of a few hours ago  I was just about done anyway  but must admit it was a guilty pleasure to follow and there was just  something intriguing about watching the sub devolve in a matter of days  hours  as far as I can tell For anyone out of the loop I  believe  and stand to be corrected on any of this the whole  movement is less than  weeks old It apparently was started by a Tiktok user by the name of Kyle Royce who posted about being guilted and called out by others over being attracted exclusively to women who were born female and I believe he coined the term  superstraight at that point This meant acknowledging that trans women are indeed women and that if you re a straight man you re attracted to them just as much as any other type of women by default hence the need for this new term to specify that as a heterosexual man you re only attracted to biological women and this makes you  superstraight as it were This ended up catching the guy a lot of flak and he was called out as transphobic etc  This is where I m a bit hazy on the details  I really thought the subreddit was formed as a tongue in cheek response to the  ber woke reaction calling this guy out but in essence wasn t to be taken overly seriously  they were using the abbreviation  SS for God s sake of course I thought it was a joke I saw posts calling out  superphobes and calling for superstraights to band together and unite for a greater good  it was a parody a la the Super Best Friends in South Park  there was no way this was     for real I saw it as shining a light on the ridiculousness of the extent woke culture has gone to and holding up a mirror to their cause with a  cause of their own I was into it because I genuinely don t think anyone should be given shit over who they are and aren t attracted to or who they should be  allowed be attracted to and thought the ironic shitposts and memery was an  up yours to anyone trying to guilt straight dudes telling them what to do  but also just saw it as a good time as I procrastinate on reddit  Soon it wasn t just straight dudes anymore there were superstraight girls posting  transitioning pics going from non pregnant to pregnant people posting aryan looking  super families then supergays superbis even supertrans  trans who were only attracted to trans but hey the more the merrier we re just having a good time here Lots and lots of superlesbians posting I was still assuming at this point that there was a comedic air to all of this People would post and ask if the sub was for real and of course people would respond that it was a legitimate sub keeping in line with what I thought was the spirit of the sub I even responded to one myself to assure someone that  we were legit Another time I suggested we have our own flag emojis  I said it thinking it would add an obnoxious authenticity to the movement but I think people thought it was unironically a good idea and it got something like    upvotes lol  Extremely quickly the mood on the sub changed terms like TERFs were being thrown around  Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists posts were made about trans women raping biological lesbian women by coercing them into sex under the guise of being a fellow biological woman Charity posts for women s shelters that banned trans women were posted and stickied Someone commented with a link to a men s shelter that reached the top of the post and the OP responded that their focus would be on the women s shelter for now and that they wanted to concentrate on one at a time to give people a break in between asking for donations I didn t know that the sub had become a channel for fundraising or who the OP was as an authority to tell anyone who their money should go to while disregarding the other charity but the priority was stated clearly  I m not the sharpest tool in the shed but the penny had dropped at this stage that this was something else now it looked like a hostile takeover from the remnants of the  lgb drop the t crowd trying to make their reddit comeback A quick Google and I saw a post on Ovarit from feminists who were rallied behind the superstraight cause for their own reasons but were giving a stark reminder to their own that straight dudes were appalling in general and that any allied common interest was an unfortunate coincidence They were not to join in with the memes and humour because the straight dudes didn t care enough about women s rights or radical feminism and that women could not be funny in their eyes anyway  Tl Dr  Piss takey subreddit suggesting straight guys should be allowed choose who they wanna be with in the form of memes and shitposts becomes subject of hostile takeover by radical feminists within days who enforce their own agenda astonishingly quickly and lead to the sub having a transition of its own sucking any and all fun out of it turning it into a dour political black hole for humour Men resume their rightful place as cause of all pain and suffering and are asked to fund a women s shelter shortly before the sub is driven into the ground altogether 
MensRights,1615375211,This is more of a mental health post than anything else I ve noticed that a few of the men on here get obsessed with the level of hate and inequality that gets levelled towards men and that s fair but you gotta stay away from toxic communities like the feminism ones on here and in other places In exposing yourself to all that hate every day you will be impacted by it Men please take care of yourselves Have open and honest discussion here and in other spaces that are actually interested in equality but when you go to those other forums that are only interested in female supremacy you will be shat upon from dizzying heights and I can only assume that s what you might be looking for because at this point you shouldn t be expecting that conversation to go differently You re actively seeking out people who hate you stop it just live a good life do good work and take care of your communities Toxic ideologies like feminism always die it might be popular today but a lot of hateful things used to be popular all you have to do is keep speaking up for yourself in your every day life Think of it this way a black person making an impassioned speech about racial equality at a KKK rally is stupid because no one there is interested in their views and in fact actively hates them for being black so making impassioned equality speeches and paragraphs in feminism groups is stupid because they do not care about men s rights and in fact actively hate you for being a man who loves himself Stop feeding yourselves to these wolves it s having a detrimental effect on your mental health Please take care of yourselves

MensRights,1615355820,Sorry for the format and also if is not allowed or correct but I need to share this This time surrounding the march  th protests in my country put me in a critical point  I fully support the critique against the Mexican government for the lack of actions towards violence and their misogynistic behaviour Nevertheless seeing all the hate speech shared in the social media towards men by the common folk by women that at one moment I considered friends or colleagues   All the media coverage for the protests also seeing my male friends arguing with my female friends about which gender is more  victimised and how the feminist are too violent or too extremist made me realize that the problem is not the injustice or violence from one gender to another   What I realised is that all the modern society is showing the true idea women s life is instrinsecally worthy Therefore all their problems are important worthy of attention and action to be taken  The underlying message also is Men s life is worthless men are expendable therefore their problems can be ignored as there are and there will be more men to fill the gap And that s what hurt me the most If we raise the banners to protest for men s rights that our life is worthy we will find ridicule jokes and be minimised That we should man up that is not a big deal We are treated as mere numbers in the statistics And that will be my stand point from now on Not fighting the feminist not contradicting but raising awareness on the men Issues as the feminist did But not asking for special treatment only what is fair 
MensRights,1615352589,  Note Read the whole post before you comment and dont just skim read it or you will probably miss some big and important things I have said   There are a lot of people out there especially online that say that white men rule the world and receive extra privileges because of it but I very rarely see this I have never been treated any different because Im a white dude Not in school not in public not by family or friends And I have never seen any different treatment of white males compared to other people that was helping the white men I am even to go out and say sometimes it feels like I get treated worse because I am a white male For example this post    and most of that sub If I said something like that about women unless I said it to the far right I would become twitters new poster boy to hate receive a lot of brutal comments and probably receive a death threat But she  presumably and i feel its a safe guess can make fun of a issue that a lot of men face that affects their mental and physical health with encouragement Now does the porn industry dehumanize women Yes I agree with that but it also sets unrealistic expectations for men too and I sure as hell have never seen anyone say that Theres also this post   which isnt upsetting but the comments are brutal Theres one comment that really pisses me off too because its full of lies  Because men only ever pretend to care about men s issues when they re trying to shut down conversations about women s issues  No Just no Remember when the boyscouts were shut down over the sexual abuse of boys I dont know about all men but a lot of the ones I knew were happy that something like that was being put to an end Then theres the thing that every day is mens day Im genuinely concerned here I guarantee you     the only men who agree with this are so far to the political right there wives arent allowed to speak unless spoken too and they arent the proudest examples of a man The last thing is mens mental health When women post something about depression or anxiety they are called strong and heroic  that isnt a bad thing its a fucking amazing thing but when I do it somewhere that isnt centered around mental health I see a dramatically less happy comments Ive been called weak and it hurts Im expected to be strong and emotionless in public because I am a man  The mens suicide rate is nearly  x times higher and the homeless mens population is double So I sit in bed tonight wondering is there actually any privilege for men because it doesnt seem like it Am I overlooking somethings Maybe being a little dramatic What do you think reddit   Important Note I am not trying to downplay womens or minorities issues I see that they too face hurdles in life but in my opinion  white men are facing large hurdles and  hate I do not encourage hating on anyone including the comments or the people in the post mentioned above Do not do that it is a really bad thing to do     I will try and link the post down below in the comments

MensRights,1615333636,So I just found this sub and without thinking much I hit the follow button   After looking thru some comments I ve noticed a lot of people absolutely shitting on feminists I can understand that I am guilty of that on occasion especially the extreme ones I just want you all to know that there are women out there like myself that actually have good intentions and truly just want equal rights not special treatment I do identify as a feminist for lack of a better word but I normally just show it thru actions rather than saying that out loud I may be the exception to the rule but we do exist Not quite sure if this is just a place that angry men come to bitch about women or if you all truly have good intentions as well but I find it interesting that you have such a large community here in this sub and I think it says a lot about our society and how men really feel oppressed in certain ways  Anywho if y all ever want an objective female perspective I can provide that otherwise I ll just lurk 
MensRights,1615329476,So my sisters are your classic university  liberal SJW s and whenever i m with them they will constantly be saying things like  Why are all men like that  Or  I hate men   One of my recent favourites is when one of them and I were arguing about this and she was like  You have no idea what it s like to be a woman but yet she thought it was completely fine for her to prejudge what it s like to be a man Another classic from the other one is the  Well we don t need men  She ll go on about how women could essentially just kill off all men and just use sperm to artificially impregnate people but when I hit back with well men could do that as well with eggs she was like no My main point of this is that it s really starting to annoy me and it is really isn t helpful during everything that s happened recently for myself to be constantly bombarded with  Men bad and  Kill all men  Any way I just wanted to get that off my chest for once 
MensRights,1615324241,Everyday I come on here and see more and more posts about how feminism is hurting our cause or how some dude has been charged with rape or some dude has been killed today It s honestly quite depressing to see all this This sub is now becoming more negative than positive and we are just proving our hater s assumptions about us correct with how we behave This place has become less about men s rights and combating the misandry we see on a day to day basis and more for complaining about life s frustrations We claim to have absolutely no tolerance for misogynists but there are several MGTOWs who haven t been downvoted to all hell yet Sooner or later we won t be any better than r MGTOW   amp  x   B For example take a quick look at the sidebar We have for more negative flairs than we do positive flairs A lot of them haven t even been used enough to appear on the sidebar Almost every post here are flared as either   Social Issues   Discrimination   Feminism   General Sometimes you may see a post flared as  Progress or  Humour  but those make up the vast majority Why do we call ourselves a movement if we aren t doing anything big to benefit our cause People have already disproven the wage gap feminism and even the patriarchy So if these are the major things standing in our way why do we not at least try to change it We have an already solid list of problems men face on a daily basis pinned to the sidebar as well as an even broader list in our back pockets Why do we continue talking about how hard life is when we aren t even taking the steps necessary to improve it And I know that men can t win in today s world and we d get hate from incels screaming about how misogynistic we are for being fed up of the bs we face on a daily But if we band together and protest a lot we could make this work Take the Women s Rights Movement as an example Remember all the boomers shooting them down when they started out Well they persevered and managed to succeed at their goals If they could do it so can we Maybe then we ll have less  Discrimination in our feeds and more  Activism Support and  Progress  amp  x   B So who s with me Let s get off our butts and start gaining those rights

MensRights,1615506062, Remember Freedom is the right of all sentient beings More importantly it is a privilege Many have honored it and do honor it today Some have greatly abused it Few denied it to others for various iniquitous reasons such as prejudice Whether freedom is a right or privilege no one has the right to take it away from others    Optimus Prime from Transformers  amp  x   B I m pretty sure we can all agree that that there are a lot of problems men face that women often don t have to because of gender I E Men commit suicide more often the majority of homeless people are male and so on But one thing we as men might come to think is that women are born with more entitlement than men and men have often used that to say that all women are bad But that s just simply not true Now before you tell me things like  Oh You re one of the lucky ones  or  Oh You re probably not even a real male for saying stuff like this  let me tell you a little story about myself I remember growing up in a small town in Montana and would go out of town almost every Wednesday night to go to a Christian youth group However this circle of cliquey popular girls would often tease and prank me but not on the biases of gender Instead they were teasing me because of my mental disability  being Autism  But as much as I know many females that have been like this  and even worse in some cases  I also know many females that aren t even a little like them Such as my principle who has given me many amazing opportunities to improve myself and where I am and my mom who has also done just as much as my dad to provide for me  not dissing my pops Love you dad  Also let us not forget that there are so many women out there who while speaking for women s rights have also advocated for ours like Helly Shah or Allie Stucky These brave women and more have advocated for us and risked being labeled as bigots and traitors for it At the end of the day I know there are a lot of men who have had a lot of bad experiences with women and have used those experiences to hold a grudge against all women but in my experience that s because they haven t met any women that are better Trust me there are better women out there people I think my point is we should judge people based on character and not their gender  amp  x   B  This is one of the reasons why beings like us exist We may be aliens to this planet but we still have a responsibility We have to save them from our war Even though we are strangers sometimes a stranger can be a great teacher Even a savior And perhaps soon It will be up to us to remind them of where they stand So then they have more knowledge on how to make progress as a civilization so they can finally be one with each other Like how we once were Before the Decepticons When we were peaceful and just And I promise you We will be again peaceful and just    Optimus Prime from Transformers

MensRights,1615498701,I really love my mum And normally we are able to talk about controversial issues quite well But recently I tried to have a conversation with my mum about the men in the criminal justice system I complained at a quote that said that men got away with crimes saying that was completely untrue and its a disgusting thing to say Men face significant discrimination in the criminal justice system But the problem is that my mum was a victim of domestic violence So she sees her experiences in the criminal justice system and when i challenge them I m essentially delegitimizing her experiences from her point of veiw When I have conversations with her about these things i try to avoid the subject because i know its something she went through But whenever i try to explain that I m not trying to minimise her experience by saying women also commit domestic violence she shuts down and refuses to talk I m kinda fine with this more or less because i know she s not trying to be rude or ignore me she just finds the conversation hard But for me it really sucks cause I m not trying to make my mum feel like any less of a victim but i don t see the harm in having more people know things about mra I also hate leaving things unsaid Like this is something in really believe in and we can disagree but i want to at least be able to have a conversation with my mum about this especially considering we never really talk about it as a family IDK maybe i brought it up in the wrong setting I just really want to have the conversation in general and i think it would be hard if every time I say something it comes off as I m either delegitimising her experiences or am just not listening

MensRights,1615486206,    Have you ever wondered why you could put everything into a relationship with a woman and still have her disrespect you Why is it that women look fondly and respect men that have no respect for them Find out what the  Female Chakra tells us about women s behaviors around men that help them versus men that crave women to do for them 
MensRights,1615485734,So just take a breath Put down the phone for a while Social media is not a reflection on the truth A savvy loaded Instagram story is not a reflection of the truth All the girl s on your timeline being temporarily feudal against the entire male sex is not a reflection of the truth It can feel hostile right now Between IWD and the death of Sarah Everard people want answers A carte blanche ultimatum to men to  step up their game is not a reflection on how you act towards women or anyone else It can also be sickening when it s posted by a woman who has caused you anguish in the past Again it s not a reflection on the truth it s just optics from people who want attention Or who want to empower themselves because they as individuals have not done enough to empower themselves It s a really charged time so don t forget to look after your head Get sleep get a walk in do something productive in the fresh air It ll all pass 
MensRights,1615483747,I don t know if you guys know but in the UK literally in the last few days a news headline has blow up over the disappearance and murder of a women named Sarah Everard The reason I bring this up is let s be honest if it was a man who disappeared or was murdered nobody would care and it wouldn t break local news let alone national news Not only that but it was apparently done by a male police officer and yet again the feminists are at it saying how women are too afraid to go out at night I saw one post on Twitter that was a rant about this and it got over    k likes with people agreeing women are being hurt Even tho men are the largest victims of violent crime Clearly this is discrimination Of course it s bad she was murdered no doubt by the bias and blaming of men is absurd   Link to article   
MensRights,1615481894,Can t help but laugh at the irony You preach that  no means no  but that didn t stop you from shoving your hands down my pants despite my protests You laughed as you took off your clothes and forced yourself on me You claim to have been too drunk to remember but I know you wouldn t accept that excuse from a man The crazy thing is I m on your side I consider myself a feminist I m a firm proponent of equal rights No woman should feel afraid for her safety when walking down the street at night In a way this has helped me understand your struggle even more That was the most powerless I have ever felt despite being strong enough to repeatedly push you off me But I let you escape with your dignity I didn t tell our friends what you had done It s a slap in the face for you to come out and post this when I know you don t uphold those values yourself  The thing about equality is it s a two way street Take a look in the mirror before you post something so hypocritical 
MensRights,1615475444,In the UK at the moment the disappearance of Sarah Everard has been a huge talking point This has led to discussions on twitter and other social media outlets over women s safety One of the most common points raised by women on this issue that I ve always struggled with is  Men need to hold other men accountable for their abusive behaviour and I ve never figured out what they mean by this and how to tackle this particular point Where have women gotten the idea that these awful rapists murderers and violent men are sharing the information of their crimes with their friends  If they have any the majority of the time the more serious ones are loners How can we convince women that we are just as clueless as to who in particular we need to be calling out The second dilemma I ve got is the safety at night thing All people  Particularly in a city should be wary at night I went to Uni in Southampton and I always made sure I was walking home with someone at night or on the phone to someone the whole way home I ve never thought it was a gendered issue it s just what I ve been raised to do to stay safe in fact it s what my Mother insisted I do I would really appreciate some insight or advice into this topic 
MensRights,1615471055,I ll start by saying that I m sorry for failing you guys I should have known better or expected less I didn t get a lawyers help because I didn t want much just for the curriculum to be changed for the sexual assault talks Basically I told them what happened and they said the new administration is different and that they already do the things I say So basically they aren t going to do anything and it was all a waste of time  I m sorry for letting everyone here down I guess I was too stupid to expect to get results with my lack of help or expect something good to come out of this

MensRights,1615424349,I m honestly too sick after hearing this to write anymore If you want to hear for yourself the link is below Maybe I passed over it but I couldn t find the original post in AITA or I d provide the link to that too I need to lay down  
MensRights,1615421687,  do you have the glasses from my last post keep them on    Heterosexual men always have and always will despise women      well uh thats a bold statement switch the genders and that sounds like what an incel would say  It is because they cannot both respect us and be sexually attracted to us those things are always mutually exclusive    you can respect someone and find them hot  Their brain just somehow functions so that what they re attracted to sexually always has to be less than    thats not how it works   nobody sees their significant other as less than or their suboordinate they see them as idk a   significant other     Heck the whole Madonna whore complex is a great example of this mindset As soon as a woman becomes something he might even respect a little bit  she s still just an object to him now gone from sexual to motherly  the sexual attraction disappears    we dont see you as objects you ve been on IncelsWithoutHate   you can be attracted to someone you respect  chances are if we dont like you we dont respect you no matter how highly you think of yourself you can be however attractive but with a personality like that we dont respect you if anything you re  objectified when we no longer respect you  we might not like your personality but we like your body  but if we respect you too thats not the case  If a man is sexually attracted to women he just simply cannot see us as actual human beings    we recognize you as actual human beings   like I know you re a real person behind Mutteriman   I dont think I d like you but I know you exist   and there are various girls who I ve been equals  even suboordinate  to and attracted to   both romantically and sexually     It has something to do with power just think about how much some many men hate homosexual men especially the ones who are more submissive and feminine    we dont hate gay people   we just don t respect those who dress as a clown   and before you call me out  I mean those who literally look like a clown   RuPaul is fine he s just looking feminine   but the netflix thumbnail for his show has a literal guy with the clown hair and the white powder and all that  They aren t  men anymore and hence not human To men a person cannot be respected if he she is in a receiving end sexually    to you maybe  What makes this all so sad is that women are not like that at all We ve loved men and women all over the world continue to love them in such an innocent and pure way We believe in romance and deep emotional connections We are capable of seeing them as more than just objects    bruh really insulted half the human race and explains how the other half is perfect  We can have male friends but  heterosexual men can not fathom the idea of being friends with women that would mean they d have to see us as actual human beings first    just because none of your male friends dont want to be around you doesnt mean they objectify you because you re female   I assure you its an attitude problem the same way how incels arent rejected cause they re short  misogyny is bad for getting girls  They always want to benefit somehow    sex isnt neccesarily a perk though  Some might argue that there are so many gold diggers and shallow women but it s really men who have made us that way We ve been taught to be dependent on men We ve been taught that only our looks and youth matter How can men complain about a system they created    you   literally have an entire guide  that states men will immediately leave you if you arent perfect     A LITERAL FDS HANDBOOK THAT SAYS THAT      AND IT USES THE SAME WORDS INCELS USE LIKE  a becky and  a chad I SWEAR  anyway have a good one edit but its not an actual edit was abt to submit and I got  your post needs flair  and I remembered to highlight a reply     you are making the problem      she is saying that if he wants to fuck its fine      and you are jumping and saying it means he disrespects her  wanting to have sex does not mean we cant respect you
MensRights,1615420268,    Context     the post in question in and of itself  dishonesty in a relationship is a reasonable issue   the response however is not     put on your glasses you ll need them   gt TLDR Being a working woman is the goal because if you have your own money you can leave SAHM is a precarious position and risky A HVM can turn low value after       or   years So you should always be financially stable of your own accord  okay this is literally saying you should be a career woman so you can leave marriage   right off the bat    gt Majority of women who stay in abusive relationships do so because they do not have the financial ability to support themselves alone especially if they have children Case in point above  alright this is true and to be fair thats a serious issue    gt There also doesn t even have to be abuse You could wake up one day and realize you have now become a  mommy bangmaid or just plain old realize this is not the life you desire and newsflash you need money to leave   he doesnt have to do anything you can decide that you re a mother who takes care of the house or realize you just dont like working and leave   this is literal irresponsibility and   exactly  what deadbeat dads do  they decide they dont wanna rise to being a father and just leave you cant just decide you dont want to be a mother and walk off    gt Some women on FDS say that if you want to be a SAHM you should have a rock solid prenup passive income before marriage have a stash sufficient for your possible escape    gt    gt Bullshit that is not enough    gt    gt Firstly that isn t even realistic for most women since majority of households in America need two incomes to survive In           of all household in America were  dual income      gt    gt Secondly a woman would need enough money to not just sustain her during a divorce but for a few years after Losing out on career advantages and progress derails financial stability She will need extra time to either go back to school or work her way up the ladder to a wage until she reaches a median salary for the country    gt    gt Not to mention no one wants to employ someone with a   year gap on their resume and if they do happen to get hired it s for well below the average salary It s been proven statistically that  divorced women are significantly poorer than their married counterparts   And while women s livelihood   decreases  after a divorce men s livelihood   increases  after a divorce    gt    gt Thirdly even a HVM is not going to sign a  rock hard prenup that will entitle his female partner to    of all assets But I ll bite Who s to say in the culmination of a divorce that he won t hide assets or properties What will you do if your HVM is no longer a HVM and pulls LVM moves A HVM can turn low value after       or   years The person you marry is not the same person you divorce true   you need money to leave  gt   Thirdly even a HVM is not going to sign a  rock hard prenup that will entitle his female partner to    of all assets  because its      this literally isnt even equality or maybe       since hes asking you to marry him this is outright stupid  gt Clearly being a stay at home mother isn t working out in our favor no matter how many women    desperately   want to stick to this traditional ideal  did someone say   our       again working as a class does not help individuals  individualism is why some are better off than others and you must accept that   gt The  only way this would work is    if you come from a well off family that provided you with a padded trust fund    you are highly educated in a lucrative easily employable career  doctor orthodontist optometrist etc  or    your husband gives you half of every paycheck    gt    gt If this isn t you don t be a SAHM if your parents give you money if you re a doctor or your husband gives you      off every dollar he makes otherwise dont be a stay at home mother   bRuH   alr rant complete
MensRights,1615412961,we all know how feminism wants to claim women are so  objectified and all that and they want to say men are privileged and it s a man s world stuff like that they will say they re objectified while we get drafted in wars because we are literally considered disposable and they ll say they re objectified after leaving a disaster first because of  women and children  since men are literally considered disposable they ll say we are privileged despite nothing being truly catered to us I get that feminism has some valid points as does  meninism  I mostly advocate for egalitarianism over feminism or  meninism but that s besides the point  point is everybody in society views men especially white men as  privileged scum pos  because society views us as so privileged they actively ignore anything truly wrong with how society treats us and hates us for being so  privileged when arguably women are more privileged imo but even then the whole concept of  privilege is silly I never have ever called someone  privileged and as a whole I dont think anybody is really truly  privileged in society unless you re a filthy rich corrupted elite  Anyway the only people who will care about you are other men men are supposed to be the care giver and anything that they deal with they re just told to man up or whatever you re expected to care for others when others arent expected to care for you even then most men wont care about you either most men only care about women either for relationship purposes or to try to get sex or whatever but really go around saying  I m a man and depressed or  my wife abused me  and see how little anybody cares  ever since I made close friends with my  bros I ve felt so much happier since I always had girl friends beforehand I never had to worry about if this new girl I met was trying to manipulate me into sex by saying she loved me and leaving after or how a girl friend is complaining about how privileged I am and how much she  hates all men  I just can play video games with my bros and it s a genuine experience not that I didnt hsve good experiences with girl friends but it s just such a different thing  bros better ourselves for each other because honestly  nobody else cares never had to worry about a friend of months years blocking me for having a different opinion when they all can just talk about it and even if they disagree it s fine because we are bros and we dont let that shit get to us it s just much more genuine

MensRights,1615400894,I am aware of this sub s rule about mentioning activity in other sub reddits but what happened to me in another sub is a reflection of what is happening to me in real life too In a sub that discusses moral issues I posted my opinion about abortion My post was more in the form of a question as I am still unsure about how I feel about abortion I was immediately attacked by dozens of people and I was downvoted into oblivion I do not mind being downvoted as long as the person who downvotes me also explains why they disagree with me  But many people kept telling me that since I am a man I am not allowed to have an opinion about what  women do with their bodies  As always I was polite in my replies and I did not even react when insulted in the most vicious and personal way They went so far as to say that a fetus is just a parasite To my surprise a day later I was banned from the sub but I received a message from the moderators telling me that I had to apologise for being a bigot and for trolling I decided to humour them and I apologised They kept asking me to apologise again Eventually they told me to send them no more messages What is so shocking is that it has become acceptable for men to be denied from expressing their opinion let alone having a say in any action that involves women  In the case of abortion men should also have a say If a woman decides to abort a child I have had with her I think that my views should have some weight too 
MensRights,1615574854,Men have to serve  years mandatory in the Israeli military while women only have to serve  years This is neither fair nor right for women Either decrease the years of mandatory service for men or increase them for women Otherwise give women less rights in other areas if you are cutting male rights in military service Women can t say they want equal rights and then go back and defend policies like this 
MensRights,1615565312,I am currently writing a masters thesis on impulsivity and emotional regulation a process underlying practically all mental illness and I believe there are some important parallels to be drawn between these processes and the current climate of proposed female vulnerability that I think is worth sharing  It is first important to understand that we are machines constantly recognising environmental cues These cues e g the sound of running water or the smell of a fast food joint guide us toward beneficial resources such as food and water Furthermore cues such as the howl of a wolf guide us away from potential threats Our dopaminergic reward system plays a really important role in regulating our behaviour directed toward these cues Take the example of smelling the fast food joint the irresistible familiar smell guides you through the door and drives to purchase the divine greasy treat Subconsciously your brain has observed a cue and predicted a reward based on your previous behaviour toward the cue Due to your brain s correct prediction of the reward it releases a large amount of dopamine to help you remember your response  buying the burger is a beneficial reaction to the cue On the flipside not buying a burger is likely to make you a bit sad as your brain incorrectly predicted the response to the cue and less dopamine than expected is released  Impulsive disorders such as OCD substance and behavioural addictions all stem from maladaptive responses to cues In other words a cue may have a much more substantial effect on cognition than it deserves You can think of this as the snap of an opening can of lager to an alcoholic an otherwise normal cue that is now tied to intense craving of alcohol  What has this got to do with women and their perception of safety Well being the plastic malleable creatures we are our response to environmental cues can be learned from others Most of us know to steer clear of a rattle snake without having any prior experience of its bite This is the issue The continuous conversation about female safety has taught many young women to recognise men as a cue  especially in the presence of other cues such as the time of day that something horrible will happen to them This leads to maladaptive responses to the cue such as crossing the road calling a friend or getting in a taxi that results in you guessed it  Nothing The fact that nothing happens results in a nice dose of dopamine reaffirming their response to the cue no matter how unnecessary it was Why is this a problem Men are unfairly being associated with horrible people and are being mass generalised as such This is damaging not only for men but for the women who are conditioned into thinking that any man is after them The only way we can counter this is through education In a twist of narrative I believe it is now time not to have a conversation with your son about how to make women feel safe but to educate feminists and others  men and women alike who perpetuate a notion of constant murder and abuse toward women It was never men telling women to be vigilant dress a certain way or avoid the streets at night that fearmongering came from within the feminist community that constantly reduces women to nothing more than perpetual victims 
MensRights,1615561805,I have been seeing ALOT more of these on some girls I follow on Instagram adding to their story talking about how afraid they are of walking out at night because of men is there something that has happened because the amount more this has been showing up for the last day or two can t be a coincidence   
MensRights,1615560895,There s a new ad on the local radio that is advertising conjugal violence In it a men is saying that he has prepared her favorite meal after a week of going through her phone messages calling her names insulting her friends and so on Then at the end the announcer says  Report violence against women  I mean my wife does and says worst things to me on a daily basis Even my therapist told me recently that I m in an abusive relationship based on what I shared with her However if I was to report it it would probably back fire and I would be the one being scrutinized and punished  I m just tired of this inequality and I m scared about my son s future in this sick feminist world 
MensRights,1615559482,Metropolitan police had suggested women don t walk alone at night until the killer is found Your usual army of  activists have taken this as an attack on their rights and have replied with an barrage of abuse at men  Dangerous people exist I myself have been attacked walking home in the UK These killers and abusers aren t going to listen to someone saying  don t rape  The idea that they take advice of personal safety  respinsomsibility as an attack but then put the blame of one individual on  billion men is insane  Also on twitter a  CURFEW FOR MEN has been suggested amongst the usual of us having to cross the road when walking near them to ensure their optimal comfort These women hate men so much they would prefer men not to exist purely so they feel a smidgen safer when walking home 
MensRights,1615557091,I know there s some very anti female  anti feminist feelings in this sub and there s a lot going on to justify those sentiments But I moderate a new platform that s dedicated to TRADITIONALISM  ie The nuclear family   So what I m asking is what should I incorporate for men s issues   Should it be a section on feminist rhetoric hatred against men or just something to discuss the daily challenges men face in this age I m very much open to suggestions and truly appreciate the feedback 
MensRights,1615535675,I m curious to hear what other people here think about the new  TooManyWomen hashtag that s trending It seems that people have gotten sick of the  not all men responses that inevitably show up when women s issues are being discussed due to the inevitable  all men are dangerous type of language that tends to be used when sexual harrassment and rape are being discussed In order to avoid that they ve shifted to saying  too many women  as in too many women have been harrassed assaulted and raped Too many women face these problems on a regular basis for the problem to be ignored too many women get harrassed on a regular basis to stay silent about it At first glance it seems to be a great idea it addresses the real and serious problems that women face without condemning every man for it and should help the discussions not devolve into the usual men vs women arguments 
MensRights,1615532162,  Some quotes  Boys are more likely than girls to die in their second decade of life    But even more troubling Blum s team  found   that boys suffered higher levels of physical violence neglect and sexual abuse by adults than girls   In  one study   of       children age   and younger three quarters of the boys who reported being sexually victimized said the person who violated them was another child    In a little more than half those assaults the violator was a girl      The overwhelming majority of male rape victims say that the person who violated them was another male but    most male victims of other kinds of sexual violence say they were violated by a female      When we convey to boys that unwanted touch is a serious issue of sexual assault only when it affects girls and not when it affects boys we are sending a message that only girls bodies are worthy of protection   As the trial approached lawyers representing the school board asked the judge to prohibit Martin s legal team from using certain terms in front of a jury rape aggravated rape sexual battery sexual assault  Finally a real gem  Lara Stemple    told me that her efforts to bring attention to male victims  and to the surprisingly high rates of female perpetration of such violence  have at times triggered false accusations that she is aligned with men s rights activists who are known for anti feminist and misogynistic language and ideology  Even in an article about sexual violence against boys MRAs are  misogynists  God forbid aligning with them That s the Washington Post to you 
MensRights,1615513646,I think the original text was written by feminists demanding all men change their behaviour to suit their irrational feelz and fears but what shocks me is how bad things have gotten that seemingly sensible men are now so cowed and beaten over the head with feminist lies everyday that they too also believe we should have to behave differently in a discriminatory way just because of our gender Seems a sad number of men are now becoming the white knight propaganda filled self loathing cucks we knew feminism would make them

MensRights,1615511728,I think it would be more accurate to say men AND women are responsible for shaping social norms Of course they re also subject to social norms which will affect their role in shaping them In times of societal change you will always find those who struggle with the new societal demands Here it seems that society is trying to shift away from sexism Consequently we re seeing a lot of people struggling with change Some object to this change and are frustrated to discover that rejecting emerging norms does not foreclose their effects So I think we re seeing attitudes and behaviors reflecting this frustration Frustration is understandable It s also confusing because the source is not always clear I sympathize with frustration but we can t lose sight of the real issue Is it reasonable for women to want a less sexist society and are women using reasonable means to pursue one Those who disagree with the first question will not accept any answer to the second one And I think this is how social change always leaves some people behind Those who simply cannot concede the reasonableness of pursuing social justice ultimately reject all methods of doing so But this doesn t prevent changes from affecting them so frustration naturally follows And though I sympathize with frustration that doesn t really change anything Pursuit of a reasonable and necessary social goal justifies the frustration it inevitably creates Would it really make sense to prioritize things the other way

MensRights,1615509550,I hate the idea that we live in a patriarchy and men have life so fine and dandy However i really struggle to find remember where the data is that shows things like suicide rate in men compared to women how men are more likely to get arrested and then get a longer sentence for committing the same crime how in the UK  i think a woman LEGALLY cannot rape a man  I am from the UK so if anyone has any good studies or articles about these points could you put them below  Thanks 
MensRights,1615652962,Not once have I ever seen any man  or any woman claim something to the effect of  She was wearing that revealing halter top therefore it serves her right that she got raped   Not one person  Ever  Yet I keep seeing this supposed rebuttal of  not asking for it    Granted my personal experiences are not the sum of all knowledge so I wanted to put this out there  Has anyone here ever actually encountered a person who has claimed that a woman deserved to get raped because of the clothes she was wearing or because she went to some party in a bad area of town or whatever  If there actually is someone making claims like that I m totally opposed to them of course  But I suspect this isn t a real thing but rather a straw man   However if you have encountered this type of attitude do speak up  I m curious 
MensRights,1615651618,I find this extremely bizzare because mensrights movement are not every one i know supports womens rights as much as mens I dont see mensright activists starting trends like KillAllMen TooManyMen CurvewForMen etc We seem to be more polite we seem to do more research and suggest actual changes we are not shouting how future is female we think future is all of us The fact that we point out equalaty problems men and boys face do not make us misogynists it means we are fighting for rights that belongs to everyone Feminists instead have only misandry towards men they dont even feel bad when little boys have tough times etc Mensrights movement seems to be the only movement who wants real equality not supermacy 
MensRights,1615646914,Anybody who s used tiktok will know what I m speaking of Lately I ve been seeing a lot of people generalise men with  We don t know which men are good which is why we say All men  and so many people are spreading statistics that at best are questionable This subreddit highlights a lot of big issues but I think we need to start doing more We should have a pinned thread dedicated to killing misinformation surrounding men and link changes that need to be made to fix many of the issues men face today  For example women can t be charged with rape in the UK women who force men to have sex with them aren t legally rapists family court issues paternity allowances the lack of support for male domestic violence victims the lack of funding towards suicide prevention for men the high rates of suicide amongst men amongst many other issues We need to combat the hate speech against men on whatever platform you see it on and the best way we can do that is with facts and statistics highlighting the issues and pointing out flaws in the arguments used to support the hate speech that is being said I highly doubt governments will talk about this evident issue so I think its important that we work to fix it ourselves Yes having a subreddit is good but we need to do more if we want a change  In Britain a petition with        signatures is brought before parliament If we could get even just  of these petitions to that number we will have done a lot for the cause

MensRights,1615640422,There seems to be bit of a misconception with this case being taken out of context  too seriously She has explained later that the proposal was not  entirely serious  more so suggesting is as a point of hypocrisy in victim blaming circles with ideas of  preventative measures where women have been advised to act on a sort of natural curfew themselves to keep them safe  This isn t some legitimate attempt to suppress men it s someone highlighting a presumed double standard a fear instilled curfew for women is tolerated but a curfew for men isn t Treating this seriously is counterproductive it would be much more helpful to focus on more genuine issues rather than let a non serious attempt to point out a double standard dominate the conversation  Using this point to devalue the current situation or as a demonstration of extreme views isn t effective there are many other better talking points you could use rather than recycling something people aren t taking seriously anyway
MensRights,1615639935,I feel like this is a very real topic because it s so called incel ideology People like to insult men for not having sex but it s actually risky to have sex nowadays for men because women can falsely accuse us of rape falsely claim that we got her pregnant or even falsely claim that we abuse them A lot of young men feel like losers because they are virgins because society acts like the more sex you have the better person you are  I m a virgin at   yo I would say I m a good guy but then I ll get labelled as a  nice guy but because I m shorter than  ft women don t care about me but it s okay I ll work on myself Retire early if I can I m not spending money that I can grow in the market on women using me or possibly exploiting me Anyways for any good guys out there when these women are    no kids divorced with kids they ll look for you Don t fall into the trap of raising kids that are not yours if women can pick their mates you can too just do it better

MensRights,1615600864,Apologies for posting a second time about the same article    But a comment to my previous post   Even the Washington Post admits female predation of boys and men  prompted me to quote the end of the last paragraph in full  I noticed my own knee jerk resistance to the reality that unwanted sexual contact can traumatize boys just as it does girls  and to the reality that it can  matter just as much to them Deep down somewhere under my skin I was holding on to some seriously wrongheaded assumptions  ideas so ingrained I did not even notice them ideas that rendered    boys as something less than human     Now if women like the author of this article are capable of  rendering boys     children     as subhuman then what do you think they think of men Less than dogs perhaps 
MensRights,1615599336,Interesting tidbit that got buried deep into page   of the report   gt While our initial analysis of overall rates of self reported harassment and assault behaviors showed that perpetration did not differ in statistically significant ways by the gender of the respondent this equivalence altered upon removal of the  sexist slurs item from our definition of harassment Upon removal of this variable we see a marginally statistically significant trend suggesting that men are more likely to engage in behaviors of sexual harassment and assault as compared to women     of men vs    of women p          It s interesting that they try to also cherry pick out the  sexist comments part so that they could twist the numbers against men However even with their cherrypicking they acknowledge a p value of       which as anyone who has ever taken a stats course could tell you means that the difference is not statistically significant with a standard significance level of      So in the end they failed to find that harassment and assault is a gendered offense in terms of perpetration  I have a feeling that this little hidden nugget of information won t be featured in any media articles or stopstreetharassment org articles anytime soon 
MensRights,1615596063,Today I decided as one of the complaints of us MRA s is a lack of shelters for men to lodge a Freedom of Information request with the Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government  The aim of this is to see if there is a disparity in funding using information readily available on the proportion of men to women living on the streets and creating a mean cost per man and woman on the street to decide if there is an existent disparity between funding provided for both  This is short as I have just lodged the request however we will be able to answer the question in at most   days time 
MensRights,1615593892,That s a pretty tame headline in reference to multiple rapes of a minor  It s even pretty tame for the crimes she was actually convicted of   First degree sexual assault sounds a lot more serious than just the generic sexual abuse   At least she faces serious time 
MensRights,1615589828,I m seeing on all the major newspapers the BBC SKY news the guardian etc as well as Instagram posts getting a hundreds of thousands of likes How is this possible    would mean   out of every hundred women you meet has been sexually harassed which is without a doubt absolute bullshit Even in the least developed countries it would not be     It seems to be intentionally exaggerated figured to present men as a distant fiendish and out of control specie 
MensRights,1615588842,But I wanted to say I am a huge supporter of this sub and of men s rights I ended up in a heated debate on Twitter with some so called  feminists today because of the recent murder in the UK and it solidified even more within me that men get such a bad rap for things that women are just as capable of Their responses were absolutely diabolical and when I pointed out the    rise in female paedophilia and examples of where women have been allowed to get away with things such as assault    times with no jail time   they had no response other than  But look how they treat us I won t tell you what my response to that was but it wasn t nice  I ve seen the damage women do to men firsthand Please know that there are women out there that see the raw deals you get and we support you

MensRights,1615588598,This is just new theory I ve been thinking upon and wanted to get some feed back While we do have our extreme sexist people on both end of the spectrum my focus is on the people in the middle of the bell curve Most people in this group are they really sexist or are they selfish If their gender were all of a sudden changed would they still believing in the same things as they did before or would they switch sides to whatever that would serve their needs  amp be most beneficial to them  I started thinking more about this since I ve been seeing the  Notallmen tag  And I m a guy who had been harassed by females before but didn t really speak up on it because men just shrug it off  Quite recently I invited a girl over  amp she wanted to have sex I was into her but didn t feel like having sex so I made sure I was drunk that it was whiskey D She kept trying to push us to have sex the entire night and ran around flashing on me  amp doing things to provoke me I kept thinking that this is weird Switch roles I d be in trouble She apologized to me the next day The moral of the situations that I ve been in  amp  Notallmen is that  this is more of a power dynamic If women had the power they d be doing the same  amp I ve experienced this first hand I m not submissive guy at all but I ve been groped on first dates hit on my face on first dates  in a flirty manner but I don t like it  pressured for intercourse If women had more power and physical prowess we would see more of this across the board Which kind of brings back to my main point that this is more of a power dynamic to the vast majority of people  amp individuals being selfish Open to thoughts

MensRights,1615723095,So I saw a twitter post today with a few thousand likes and it was talking about how Gay men are included when women say   we don t feel safe around men  The OP then went on to reference her being harassed by gay men  which is valid and is an issue that should be talked about   However she then went on to say that gay men still have male privilege and well   um   Let me just quote it  Y all have still grown up with male privilege you ve been socialised to believe you re more important and have more power than us and that doesn t go away because you suck dick lol  Now I would really like you to tell me how I a gay guy was socialised to believe I m more important than women Was it the feeling of estrangement in school cause I grew up feeling isolated from everyone cause I was  weird and different    Was it me thinking there was something wrong with me Oh no it was definitely having no male friends right I think it shows that people will bring  male privilege into an argument to make them sound like they re being reasonable but they re not when they clearly haven t thought about who actually has the privilege The only people with male privilege are the privileged Joe from down the street who s a plumber isn t privileged The CEO of a company is actually privileged Rich privileged people have the upper hand in society they have influence your average dad doesn t  This is my first post here so it s probably not well thought out or anything I just felt confused as to why someone would make a post that was causing man hating against the people who are meant to be your allies Also many gay men in the comments spoke about their experiences with being harassed by straight women and guess what They got attacked dismissed and hated on How can one claim men are privileged and then go on to dismiss someone s harassment purely based on the fact he s a man

MensRights,1615692675, I am unsure if this is the proper tag but if it is not then I am sorry and would hope that the admins correct me instead of deleting my post So I saw a new post from TheTinMen and it got me thinking about the tragic case of Emmett Till What if feminism is in some ways another lever that can be or is used to reinforce white supremacy systemic racism and police brutality  Think about it By breeding distrust of men and avoidance of them you create or influence stereotypes that they are dangerous If you create that stereotype of dangerous men you potentially create a criminal bias against them especially towards men of color This bias impacts average people law enforcement and the courts who will treat false allegations as truth and proceed accordingly After all that s essentially what happened to Emmett Till He was falsely accused by a woman and the men who murdered him got off because they believed they were serving justice to a  perpetrator  We see this now with the curfew in the UK false rape allegations on college campuses and so on Apologies if this came off as incoherent Just figured I d create some discussion on the topic and wanted to see if I m wrong because I feel like I m not 
MensRights,1615692592,When people hear I m a MRA people think that Means I am a racist sexist bigoted and incel I don t believe that to be true for me or for anyone here What I think MRA means is calling out what feminists believe to be true and to call out the bad things that they do in the guise of  social justice   The reason I joined MRA was because I began to understand the harm that feminism is doing on young boys and how it is just wrong that men are being treated unfairly in family court school and society in general I came to this realization in high school when I had a teacher give all of her attention to the girls in the class to help them succeed and punish the boys with extra homework and an unfair grading standard I didn t realize at first but later in the term I figured it out as it seemed that we had to do more work for no extra reward and it just seemed weird that my female classmates loved her but my male classmates and I absolutely HATED her It came down to her projecting her home life on the students I am now almost out of college so it was a long time since then but I still remember it like it was yesterday  It is just shitty that women are allowed and encouraged to be sexist and racist and just down right psycho but if a man does any of that it is a crime in the public court I just love reading tweets calling to  kill all men or to  teach men to be better  If I replaced man with woman I would be dragged all over the internet and my life would be absolutely ruined I have seen it happen with many people even men I know For example a friend let s call him John went to a party with some really popular girls and proceeded to hook up with one of them will call Jane After the party Jane regretted sleeping with him and wished she didn t Her friends told her that she could claim it was rape and encouraged her to report him to the school Luckily for John she never went through with it as she knew that it was consensual She told that to her friends and they said that if she didn t report him they would First of all it is extremely inappropriate to tell someone what they want when it isn t even true So the friend who will call Amy told the school that John raped her friend Jane and she wanted to tell you but felt she couldn t Again John got lucky that Jane told the school and the police that she didn t say that and that John didn t rape her and it was consensual Why do I mention this Because it is just one of the many ways that feminists hurt us guys and that it would be so wrong for a man to do  I simply don t understand how people think that it is ok to be sexist to men and racist towards white people as if reverse racism isn t real It just sickens me to see society turn its back towards men Judge not by the sex of the person but by the content of their character

MensRights,1615670935,I wanted to share this story I created a throwaway account because I don t trust putting this on my main account I live in the U K where in the news there s been stories of the tragic murder of a woman  Anyway my girlfriend who lives with me ordered some baking supplies from a local shop as she was making a cake for Mother s Day for her mum in our coronavirus bubble she asked me to pick them up this evening I got in my car to the bakers shop to pick up the yeast and some fresh flour and pay for them Inside the bakers shop was two women who work there it was dark outside at this time I enter the shop and said I came to pick up an order for my GF placed One of the women looked at me and spoke to the other women and whispered one of the women went out the back and I was expecting her to bring the stuff we ordered so I could pay and leave  But I was kinda shocked when the other woman told me that she wouldn t serve me as her friend who was now at the back of the shop didn t feel comfortable with me there due to my  over bearing masculine presence and said they d call the police if I didn t leave I respected their decision and left as I was more afraid at this point they may make up I did something when I never I have no idea what I did wrong I m a rather tall and fat male but I did nothing to make them feel unsafe at all My girlfriend was furious and called the owner as she knows them  a couple who deeply apologised and said the younger girl was new and with everything going on in the news it s to be expected  I guess no harm done but this is the first and hopefully last time I was refused service because I presume of my gender My girlfriend is still furious Edit for anyone wondering I went to Morrison s instead and the lovely baker guy there gave me some fresh yeast for free and bought some flour

MensRights,1615661392,tl dr Against popular opinion men more likely to be killed walking down the street men get sexually harassed too many posts on social media in the UK atm is a false and dangerous narrative calling for curfews for men and for men to  teach their sons yet this is baseless slander  amp  x   B Recently a woman by the name of Sarah Everard went missing a week later her body was found and a UK Policeman has been arrested for her murder This is a horrible situation and I hope the guy who did it rots in jail Following this there has been a massive campaign over social media and the media claiming statistics such as    of women have been sexually harassed and that there should be a curfew for men and that men need to teach their sons This was quite a lot to take in and at first I was just going to just get on with my day but since some friends asked my opinion I decided to look into it a bit Firstly it should be understood that statistics can be easily twisted to argue any point so take everything including what I have said with a pinch of salt investigate things for yourself and make your own opinions Where I have used data it is from the  Office for National Statistics   by the UK government which has data about murder over the last   years I used data for the year        chosen by random however while researching I realised I could choose data from        which would support my arguments even better but decided against it as I don t want to cherry pick data like other groups do For instance  Femicide Census   report that    of women are killed by men are from a current or former partner as it fits their narrative at that moment Recently women are now claiming that they are killed mainly while walking down the street by random men So which is true Through the data it says that women killed by a current or former partner are around     That is quite a significant difference to a point where I can t even explain how they got that number Have you heard about Kieran Campbell He is a    year old boy and he went missing the same day as Sarah   rd March and thankfully was found  days later however in all that time I saw nothing from social media or the media except for this  News Story   which contains more information about Sarah s disappearance yet in no news story on Sarah have I seen information about Kieran Why the difference Looking more into the stats I found      men killed    women killed      of which for men killed    from someone they didn t know      of which for women killed    from someone they didn t know      So women saying they re killed by random men just for simply walking down the street is a lot less likely than they are implying it is far more likely they know the guy AND it is more likely men get killed for walking down the street by someone random   Looking at where people have been killed residential vs public places in percentage Male      Women           Therefore men are far more likely than women to be killed on the street      Women are much more likely to be killed in a home than in a public place  just walking down the street which is against their current narrative   A bit off the topic but for the suspects of these murders      Female suspects are more likely to NOT be convicted of murder    of women aren t convicted of murder whereas    of men aren t convicted      Of those convicted    of men get life imprisonment whereas only    of women get life imprisonment for their murder      So basically women are REALLY unlikely to be killed by a stranger on the street yet men are more likely and spoke about less Enough of statistics let s just use some good old logic   There has been a call for men to be given a curfew of  pm to  protect women      The thing is if you single out one group and give them a curfew that is quite horrific but you can say it about men A good tool I use is can you change gender for another identifier will it still be okay to say Think race LGBTQ etc      Think about the number of people men save men are the massive majority of jobs working for public protection think police fire army etc   The    experience some kind of sexual harassment         I m not going to invalidate someone s personal experience although many posts on social media claiming that men do not experience sexual harassment is invalidating our experiences   ironic right      I find that stat quite insane I can t tell if it s accurate or not but I do have important questions         What counts as sexual harassment I ve heard some people say  being stared at by a male counts More often than not the dude was probably just daydreaming on the bus         How did they get this data did they interview random women on the street      I think that men also get sexually assaulted quite a lot but don t realise it Think about a man flashing a woman that s sexual assault Now a woman flashing a man will he if interviewed say he was sexually assaulted Me personally I have been touched inappropriately by women on multiple occasions non consensually  grabbing my butt and rolling their hand up to my inner thigh and I also been cat called  which was odd but I never really thought I has been sexually assaulted until I considered it the other way round So I wonder what  of men have been sexually assaulted And if so I don t think we should be teaching boys to not sexually harass women we should be teaching our children to understand boundaries and respect everyone    Teach sons to respect women    So this is going to be quite controversial But boys raised by singles mothers tend to be more likely to grow up and commit crime including harassing women So surely women aren t even teaching their sons And moreover can be inferred that men ARE teaching their sons and women are not Now this is maybe a bit too much of a blanket statement I believe anyone raised in a single parent household can grow up and do amazing things and won t become criminals but I think it is something worse considering   Commonly we are told that men are normalising rape due to making rape jokes I thought about this I have not ever heard a rape joke about women and only ever heard about rape jokes about men dropping the soap in the prison shower So I decided to search  rape joke on YouTube and what I found was many many videos of women making some kind of speech saying rape jokes are bad a video of a man affected by prison rape jokes as he had experienced it a comedian making jokes about how saying jokes about rape are taboo and an American Dad clip which did contain a rape joke I decided to take this further and asked people to  tell me a rape joke  no one I have asked can think of one except for the prison shower one   so please tell me a rape joke because I don t know if it is a thing So all in all what s going on right now on social media is perplexing But here s the great thing about social media you can turn it off For those who feel a

MensRights,1615657644, I appreciate any views on this but mostly I just want to open my mouth and complain about this situation and spread the word that this kind of misandry exists tl dr GF s friend is complaining about men all the time and tries to manipulate her into breaking up with me as she hates me too GF doesn t want to lose the others in the friend group but I don t like the idea of her hanging out with this toxic idiot My girlfriend has two social circles other one being her friends from uni One of her friends is really radical feminist a lesbian and someone who proudly tells people  she has no men in her life  other than her dad    Red flag   Well first I saw no problem in this everyone has the freedom to an opinion But now that I know the way she talks My GF and her friends have been meeting in our aparment for some time now and I have to listen to them At first I was happy cause I wanted to meet new people Lately I have been distancing myself from them for a reason This one girl complains about men  and straight people literally  all the fucking time  If they are watching TV  who there s so many men in this series   that male character is stupid  If they re talking about studies  this male professor is really racist and sexist and  If they re talking about politics or feminism  fuck all men   are you implying that men matter   ironic joke or is it    men are rapist pigs  I know she has asked the lecturer if she can change groups because she doesn t want to work with men ofc she worded it in a way that it s  men who are always harassing her She has also demanded that her essays must be double checked if the professor is a male Great  I have also heard her complaining about me she probably didn t realize I was home lol Apparently I m  mansplaining if I discuss things with them  even tho I mostly agree with them on many issues  I don t understand the world can t handle emotions  what     and I listen to  mens fantasy music full of rape and whores  she went thru my vinyl collection lol  Of course I have been furious at my GF for allowing her to talk like that in our home My GF told me she has also suggested breaking up with me  for no reason   and that my GF should take precautions because I might hurt her or rape her Nice Apparently this woman is a central person in this social circle and my GF is afraid to talk about this issue The others in this group are not as radical most of them being quite  normal people I would say My GF ofc wants to keep these friends as she doesn t want to study alone She also fears that she might become a target for bullying or something for example they already know shes not as left wing as they are and she gets some shit for this   My feelings   to put it shortly I don t want my partner to hang around toxic people who want to manipulate them and who apparently hate me for being a male We re afraid that if she doesn t want to be with them anymore they will accuse me of being a manipulator or something or accuse her of something else

MensRights,1615803516,Previously I posted   gt  It hurts i m just tired of it all I want to hug my mom     I was having an anxiety attack Thankfully talking to a friend actually helped     Why   I didn t know why but I was feeling very attacked by all these posts surrounding the tragic death of Sarah Evarard I sat in the shower for two hours and was recollecting my thoughts I decided to call a friend and while trying to talk I just burst out crying I realized that I felt like I was once again living in the moment I was  falsely accused  It felt like my victim hood was being stripped away because I was a man  I may have been oversensitive about it flame me or whatever  The only reason why after a whole year I could talk to women again is because another individual told me  not all woman are monsters and that was the self realization that my generalization of individuals to their group identity was dangerous    But this isn t about you   It really isn t I m glad that a lot of woman are sharing their experiences and shedding a new light on what they had to experience on a daily basis While I knew it was an issue I didn t think the scale of it would be this large So I do agree that women face the adversary of needing to be worried walking alone in the streets and it is a fair assumption for them to think the man behind her is a perpetrator  And yet I felt alienated unwanted and once again I found myself fearing women So I decided to look at it more constructively The conversation is about the struggle of being a woman needing to take more taxi rides than required   It is a real issue   But does generalizing men comparing us to ticks and even setting rules not set a negative tone towards men It feels more like  men are the issue than any solution really    I m no expert in stats  I don t care really While most post seem to always try to cater to stats towards making one community oppressed I am certain of one thing and that is my group identity does not define who tf I am    What s next   Next step for a solution to the issue is  What can we as every individual him her itself can do  rather than  What men should do because I really don t think that pushes the conversation forward  What do you guys think 
MensRights,1615803146,I understand this may not be directly linked to Mens Rights but I thought I d share it here in case anyone feels like using it So a lot of people know that radical femenists like to spread the lie that  Women earn    less than men for the same job  or some percentage of wage indifference However I thought of an argument which  should shut down a lot of liars Here s my example  Jim works in an office He earns some amount of money a year from his boss One day Jim decides that he wants to become transgender so he goes to the hospital and has the surgery Now Jim is sexually identified as a woman and goes by the name Lauren The next day Lauren goes back to  her job in the office  Now under the equal employment act Lauren s boss cannot change  her pay even if they have decided to change a part of their body  Lauren goes to her desk when the boss walks over   Sorry Lauren but you re a woman now That means I have to pay you    less of your wages I know you understand  Now here s the argument  Would that scenario ever happen in real life Lauren is a woman which means she  should be paid    less but that exchange between Lauren and  her boss would never happen because it s illogical So for that reason it proves that woman aren t paid less for the same job as that conversation would never take place

MensRights,1615769074, I just got censored for the first time I posted my men s rights view on a literal debate thread where we were supposed to debate I argued that the wage gap isn t bad and only exists because of personal choice the higher competitiveness of men and the distribution of intelligence  men are more likely to be really dumb or really smart while women are more average  However a couple days letter out of nowhere I was permanently banned I had a lengthy proper debate with others  no insults and even managed to change some views so I don t understand why I was banned My only guess was that maybe liberal woman decided to ban me for espousing that view and  offending her and didn t have the guts to debate me instead Or perhaps a male social justice warrior decided that they didn t want me on that subreddit because my views didn t align with theirs I asked multiple times why I was banned but it seems that the moderators have completely ghosted me and aren t responding 
MensRights,1615761176,Not sure if this has been seen outside of the UK but the news recently has been of  a man who killed a woman    Lots of vigils were held over the weekend  some being broken up by police   as we are currently in a national lockdown and large groups of people cannot gather This has been hailed as  police not protecting women and there is a lot of talk about there being too many women being killed by men and  women matter less than cars   and no one is talking about men I did a little research on the  Office for National Statistics   website and saw a very different picture  The increase in homicide between the year ending March     and year ending March     reflected a    rise in the number of male victims which increased from    in the year ending March     to    in the year ending March      Over the same period the number of female victims increased from    to        increase   A little more reading supports the idea that more men than women are victims of homicide in the UK  In the latest year there has been a    increase in the number of male victims     to      Conversely the number of female victims fell by     from    to      the first decrease since year ending March      Why is it that only women are being talked about It wouldn t make sense if the ratio of male and female victims was    to only talk about women but it s not it s worse for men

MensRights,1615751491,A manchild is essentially a man with means  or who has the potential to earn a decent living who focuses on himself instead of on women and starting a family  Such a man is seen as selfish and immature  And this is because the default expectation is that he should settle down get married and have children  His money isn t seen as belonging to him and his happiness isn t taken as a priority  People instead think about all the women out there who could take his money and spend it on themselves and their happiness But can t because he s too busy spending it on things he wants to do According to at least one article about this some of the signs of a manchild include   Talk of children or commitment brings panic to his eyes    He avoids serious conversation meaning he changes the topic when you try to convince him to marry you or have kids with him   His interests and friendships carry a middle school vibe  In other words he likes to have fun instead of getting serious about that marriage and children thing everyone wants him to do The default gynocentric view is that this is harmful to women  That these men who are living their lives for themselves and not for women and children are doing something wrong  And the articles you see about this definitely take that approach  The message is that a proper mature man does everything he can for women  Including handing over his money so she can live in a big house possibly have kids with him and then not have to work a job anymore Society condemns and criticizes men who don t do this which I don t think is fair  If women are strong and independent then we shouldn t be shaming men into being providers and  good husbands for them  Let him have his hobbies and spend his money how he deems appropriate  His time money and energy do not belong to women  And if you want to talk about being selfish that expectation itself is what s selfish

MensRights,1615747812,Trying to not be long winded here but this is bugging me to no end    One regular argument we hear from feminists and women s rights activists is how women must fear being raped by a random man on the street  Our typical reply is along the lines of men are  times more likely to be violently assaulted including murder more so by a stranger  Which is imperially true So this extremely sad and unfortunate murder of Sarah Everard is showing the true colors of feminism what happened to her IS A MALE ISSUE  She was murdered not raped or kidnapped she was murdered the very thing we as men show is a real problem for us at triple the rate of women  So a male victim dominated crime happens to a women and it s all about women  The issue murder has been hijacked and turned political This is something we can not let happen or allow the opposite to happen either when something exceptional happens to us  We must speak up and point out this victim championing  The media is not helping of course and we can t really contact them so it s important we point out what happened to Sarah is the very thing we men are expressing we have to worry about being murdered at triple the rate   The women s right movement is taking something that is a primary male issue to the degree of triple the rate and taking a single instance and claiming the entire problem is not only theirs but using it to place blame  This is not productive for them or us it helps no one because it s changing the narrative of who the victims  usually are which takes focus off a problem and shifts it to a smaller one Please speak up  Please make note this is the exact issue we are bringing up when women bring up walking down the street in fear of rape men have to worry about exactly what happened to Sarah and it falls on deaf ears regularly  Use this as an example of something that happens to men more than women women are not excluded from it Sarah Everard is your example and express how there are issues that happen to women more than men but do still happen to men We need to take the high road here and use Sarah Everard s untimely death as something for progress positivity and unity instead of adding fuel to the hate and blame fire with silly arguments and being defensive  Let s be positive and use this as a mutual point to talk not a contentios point to argue

MensRights,1615865126,A lot has been said and written about the Sarah Everard case except about one aspect of it the broadcast and social media reactions to it which barely got any coverage That s regrettable because I strongly feel that in the longer term exactly the media aspect will be the case s true legacy What I see currently is a mass hysteria triggered by the broadcast and social media s treatment of the case What I see is the unrestrained and uninhibited exploitation of an in and by itself anomalous case no matter how tragic When such a case is weaponized for political purposes especially when the purpose is to extract changes in legislation and public policy the result can lead or at least contribute to an unmitigated disaster It would be better if cooler heads prevailed than to risk such a disaster The Sarah Everard case is completely atypical Kidnapping a woman from a street is extremely rare both in the UK and elsewhere Crime statistics are dropping for decades and at least in the US are at a record low Men are the main targets of violent crime       of violent attacks are against men  US data  Moreover the overwhelming majority of victims of homicides by a stranger are men while women are killed more often by people they know So women are much much safer walking down a street than men But these facts never bother extremists and the propagandists serving them What they want is the weaponization of a single atypical case and anecdotes are used the same way This how propaganda is made The propagandists  in this case feminists and women who approve of them pick atypical cases or anecdotes and hype them up by the media that regrettably they control Then they use them as bludgeons to extort female friendly and anti male legislation and policies When there is no atypical single case or anecdote they just make one up Like in      when they published an entirely manufactured  study claiming that  schools shortchange girls  when it wasn t true then as it is not true now The  study got hyped up in headlines in the MSM which never performed any reality check about it The hype resulted in a faux moral panic about  shortchanged girls This panic led to legislation in      the Gender Equity Education Act  GEEA that is still not repealed even though it is clearly proven to be based on a falsehood The genesis of this piece of legislation perfectly illustrates the process from anecdote atypical case to hype to faux moral panic to ill conceived legislation that goes counter to all available facts and data and even counter to reason The success of such a tactic convinces the propagandists of the tactic s effectiveness Rightly so because despite its immorality it produces the intended results regardless how sinister those results may be From this point on the propagandists don t want to waste a single suitable  crisis  without turning it into an opportunity for hatred and extortion If there isn t a  crisis  they fabricate one What I sense as danger in this case is that the seductive power of a perfect  opportunity to enact policy changes or legislation might prevail again leading to even more baseless hatred against men even more misandry than what we already face with the appropriate policy consequences Think of the ill fated comment of a British MP about imposing a  p m curfew on men and the wide acceptance it immediately received Not universal acceptance but a wide one Many pieces circulated pondering the practical use and justification of such a curfew until even broader disapproval forced the MP to retroactively proclaim it a joke  in typical retroactive feminist fashion  It is just not very believable that a British MP would be joking in the middle of a national uproar about a murder It stands to reason that she was serious about it and meant every word Then think of the consequences if it had been taken seriously and implemented That s what  ill conceived means and the unethical use of propaganda is the fastest way to ill conceived policies Let s not fall for it this time

MensRights,1615836397,So hey  I have been on social media and hearing a lot of posts about woman being discriminated  which is disgusting and should never happen  I assume this is because if the Sarah Everand murder  again hope the perpetrator rots in jail  However the backlash against men in general is extremely worrying     So let me get something straight     I FULLY SUPPORT the movement tk encourage safety for women and making the streets safer However I have been recently seeing posts that have said  k llallmen and people suggesting that men should have a curfew  And some posts I have seen on insta  by  feepaints the one with nearly    k likes have truly got we worried Whilst posts makes some excellent points I feel as if it has some serious flaw overlooked points The final line on this post was  Not all men but probably You Excuse me what So a small percentage of men  who should be ashamed who do this suddenly represents the entire male gender If anything it wants to make me cry thinking that now I am  to the people who commit such atrocities How can people be so insensitive to the fact that males have emotions to say something so demonising To demonstrate its stupidity some of their statements sound I d like to show you what happens when we substitute a race  religion into that same statement   not all men but enough to be scared of all men    Not all  insert race people  insert crime  but enough to be scared of all  insert race people  Imagine if someone on social media posted that That would basically be a speedrun of getting cancelled lmao And before I round off I d like to lead you to the insta post from earlier   feepaints  It quotes  men who are really scared of being falsely accused are apparently part of the problem Now this is BS Now it s only a small amount of women who falsely accuse But according to their ideology it doesn t matter if its a small  of women who do I should be scared of all of them  Sounds dumb right Cos it is Finally I would like to say I love the idea of equality but does preventing discrimination against one group  require  the need to discrimate against an other No This is one way to take an organisation cause which I fully support with all my heart and then absolutely discredit everything they said and make them seem downright stupid  Rant over Love to see your opinions everyone Unlike some of the other people who discriminate against men  again I have seen good posts who don t do this I won t count out any opinions

MensRights,1615828128,Alimony in principle is gender neutral  The way it is actually applied is could be wrong But in principle seems correct If there are  people who had children together Partner  cuts down on his career to support partner the kids Now partner  has a life long obligation to support partner  financially It is because if partner  did not compromise on his career for them both he could have been much better financially  I am using he as a universal pronoun here could be a she And partner   indirectly through childcare contributed financially and is entitled to a share in their combined income If one employs a baby sitter or cook one has to pay them Partner  took up that role for free Even after a divorce even if partner  is self sufficient his career has still been set back by several years due to compromises involved in childcare So a lifelong alimony seems just There is a famous married couple husband and wife The wife is an international sportswoman and the husband took care of children and household so she could proceed in her career In case she divorces him he deserves a share in her money by right This topic was discussed before but most people here felt alimony shouldn t be a lifelong deal But if partner  could have been a ceo but is instead in a significantly lesser position thanks to career compromises isn t compensation warranted in the event of divorce 
MensRights,1615827294,The first incident that made me question my own feminist label was this incident in India A female actress and celebrity named kangana ranaut in India claimed that Hrithik Roshan a famous and beloved celebrity and  a married man courted her but made sure she was not given a role in his movie after their break up Hrithik filed a defamation case against her but media took kangana s side Even after facts revealed themselves kangana was respectfully invited everywhere to shit on hrithik The facts of this case are bizarre because kangana literally made up a relationship Here is what investigation revealed      kangana did not submit ANY proof and refused to submit even her own laptop and phone to the police She had no practical proof for a  year affair  or      Hritik submitted his phones and laptops and police traced their activity Hritik contacted kangana  times in the entire duration of the alleged affair Police actually declared that they are convinced hritik is innocent   Kangana only wrote mails to an a c that was traced to usa was probably a catfisher using hritik s name Or else ya hritik was at  places at the same time   hritik s passport had no stamps of foreign travel to paris   where allegedly he proposed to kangana   Mails where kangana obsessively stalked hritik even admitting he never talks to her were sent from kangana s mail id to hritik s  kangana said hritik hacked her a c and sent those mails to himself       Kangana s team tried photoshopping images from a party to prove an affair Hrithik s ex wife  wife at the time of the alleged affair came out in Hrithik s support and revealed original photos in which bollywood celebrities were all partying and she was present along with hrithik in that party If kangana were male media would have CHEWED her but is hypocritically silent ONLY because she is a woman Also when her ex adhyayan suman came forward bravely to reveal that kangana was abusive people made fun of him something that would never happen to women  This is to not say that women in India donot get abused But there are  sides to every coin A similar case happened in south korea kim hyung joon His ex falsely accused him of abuse and dragged him down In these cases people say there is no smoke without fire A man who makes good money is a pervert 
MensRights,1615826624,I have a feeling the answer would be HELL NO  because there are no issues whatsoever in social justice where women are blamed for anything unless it harms other women in which case it s called  internal misogyny  The issue would probably be  nonexistent altogether if there were no male abusers  But I also have a feeling that men are being harmed a lot worse mentally and physically than most people know We are still at the point where most people believe that men cannot even be victims of violence in M F relationships let alone need help  Feminists have been denying women s role in domestic abuse even though several studies have come out shedding a light on it You still see feminists trying to discredit these studies which leads me to believe that they weren t done by feminists why would they  For most of them the whole thing is a foregone conclusion and any evidence to the contrary might discredit their religious beliefs upon which so much depends See the Duluth model for example Men are pretty much on their own to deal with this

MensRights,1615930972, Part I Anthropological Analysis    Women are not sexually attracted to men   They are disgusted by the male form disgusted by our veiny musculature and disgusted by our body hair A man can never be attractive like a woman can As you can imagine this makes life unfairly difficult for men and unjustly easy for women    If you are a woman you will simply never understand what it s like to be a man   What it s like to walk down the street in public You will never understand how we are treated by society Truly you would not last a week as a male in       Good hard working well deserving men are rejected and left to rot in loneliness for no other reason than simply because they were born male For as far back as humanity goes good decent men have been tortured in this way You have twice as many female ancestors as you do male ancestors That s right   women are twice as successful as producing offspring than men   You might be thinking  what that can t be right   Just take for example this say there are two men and two women Each women has kids with one of the men We can see in this example     of the women pass on their genes but only    of the men do  Being born a man is like being born an anal beetle Females are living life on easy mode they will never have to struggle and they will never have to fight Females live a life of blissful ignorance love and acceptance   Even the most unintelligent uninteresting unsuccessful unlucky physically disabled female lives with a level of privilege far beyond    of men     Part II Sexual Anarcho Capitalism  Of course there are the  Chads  the upper echelon of men that are hoarding all the sex leaving almost nothing for the rest of us Gee sound familiar It s almost as if free markets lead to wealth inequality and   a free anarchistic overly sexual dating marketplace leads to SEXUAL INEQUALITY   Like how bootlicking capitalists will convince themselves that every poor person in America  just isn t working hard enough  so too will blue pulled normies convince themselves that incels just need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps The world is completely fair bro if you can t find a date the only reason is because you need to take a shower and hold frame Why do people think this It s because if you admit that the system is unfair you must thereby admit that your success in the system is unjustified Once you admit that the economic system is not a meritocracy it is no longer possible to say  I earned it fair and square    And by acknowledging that the dating marketplace is unjust you relinquish some of your sexual power   Sure you ve fucked plenty of girls But you didn t earn it You just got lucky Your sexual conquests in life are not based on your own merit but factors that were completely outside of your control   Think about that before you go online and give  advice to struggling men   Remember that you have no fucking idea what you re talking about when it comes to attracting women  I m trying to open your eyes You are deluded You are wrong Please have the strength to just admit you are wrong It s better to look like a fool once and admit you re wrong than to stay wrong and look like a fool for the rest of your life Men are not the problem You are not the problem kings It s everybody else that is the problem Just because someone is poor this does not mean they are lacking in some moral capacity Just because someone is sex poor does not mean that they are of lesser moral value   Part III Collective Responsibility vs Individual Responsibility Also I m not absolving myself of personal responsibility Nice try though Just because you admit that racism exists doesn t mean you re going to give up on life until the whole world is no longer racist I m just saying that your life can be shit and it s not even your fault   You wouldn t tell someone living in North Korea  Hey man quit complaining about the system you live in and only focus on yourself Have you tried going to the gym     I know as a redditor this may seem SHOCKING to you but we can work on self improvement AND point out problems in society all at the same time I know crazy right Isn t that just the most insane thing you ve ever heard   Part IV TL DR TL DR Ideas from the sexual liberation movement have been taken to such an extreme that we are now living in a hyper sexualized coomer wasteland For women this has led them to having infinite access to sex and very little access to committed relationships A incredibly small minority of men have access to more sex than any human needs in      lifetimes while the vast majority of men are sex poor and sex starved The data reflects this  There is only one whole in my argument I m an incel so therefore everything I say is automatically wrong

MensRights,1615906145,Yet my school who has a UN sort of group  can t really explain it too well is talking about violence in the home and is painting it as a women s issue I m sure these numbers don t surprise any of you but everyone I know has told me women are victims of violence more often than men     
MensRights,1615906016,Hello r mensrights Tl dr falsely accused almost lost everything if you are curious read the whole thing and if you re really curious read my post history A tl dr cannot express this adequately  I ve been a longtime lurker and occasional poster here I am a guy in his    s who was falsely accused of domestic violence and I have been active on r supportfortheaccused since just after my case started but I wanted to share here to bring visibility to this issue In May of      an ex girlfriend that I refused to date again decided that I said something just a little too mean to her and decided to go nuclear I had been dating another girl for a couple months after our relationship ended about five months before My ex was in a rough place She was  probably still is a dancer who had no real family to speak of and just could not find her way Despite the crappy end to our short relationship I still wanted to be in her life if only to show her that there were other ways to live and she didn t have to do what she was doing to survive In April of     I had decided that enough was enough A mutual friend of ours killed himself because of her treatment of him and she had done what she did to me to the guy after me Her kicking and screaming finally didn t work and I let go She did not take our friends suicide well and she started spiraling She regularly tried to contact me and I ignored her The day before this happened she showed up at my door and I saw the state she was in and felt horrible for her She had some old bruises on her neck from according to her a guy she met at a BDSM club while she was out of state They were yellow and fading so it had been some time I knew she tended to be into that sort of thing and it is the   reason in a long list of why we broke up She asked if we could go talk and I said yes like a moron We went out for drinks that night along with the girl I was dating at the time My girlfriend had to work the next day and left about halfway through the night I ubered with my ex back to her place and was worried about her suicidal ideation and wasn t in a place to drive myself considering my car was still at home and the drinking so I stayed on the couch The next morning after I had made breakfast and was getting ready to leave she started talking about rekindling our relationship which I refused I told her I couldn t carry her deteriorating mental health anymore and that this would be the last time She seemed to have taken this unusually well and proceeded to hop on a video chat with that guy she met at this club and started telling him all the same things she would tell me All the gushy nonsense When she got off with him I explained that this was why I could never be with her She had screwed me over and done this when I was with her then she did it with the guy right after me and she had done it so badly to our friend that he killed himself It was like a bomb went off She jumped on top of me and started wailing on my face and torso and screaming incoherently I didn t want to hurt her so I just tried to block her arms and calm her down I ended up with two black eyes lacerations all over my face bruises on the left zygomatic bone and a fractured floating rib I pushed her off of me and she ran and locked herself in a bathroom Some time goes by and the police show up and violently take me into custody She proceeds to tel every officer wildly different stories and had had her guy in another state call for her who s story was also wildly different from hers He had never met me and identified me as the wrong race and in the wrong clothes as noted in the police reports Every report is different actually and not on little details They re wildly different The neighbors only heard the screams from when she was beating me and none of the supposed cries for help as I  strangled her one handed I won t go into the ins and outs of everything since my post history is a pretty good play by play as this stuff was happening The biggest kicker is that she continued to text me during the time I wasn t talking to her and one of these texts is a selfie from the BDSM club out of state where the bruises I mentioned earlier are clearly visible and it is from a good while beforehand  I think I m set I show the arresting officers and     they don t care I am charged with a felony and class I misdemeanor I spend  days in jail and denied PR bond My family posts bail and I come out to my EMS licensure being  suspended while an investigation is underway  facing expulsion from my college seeing the applications I had put out for medical school since I was a junior being  no longer under consideration given the circumstances  She had called everyone important in my life My mentors my friends my family my college everyone to tell them  what I did  I faced losing everything I fought for    months I fought the allegations in court but I fought myself most of all I wanted to die every day and a few times I tried I told the world what was going on anyone who would listen as I fell apart inside I had my family and friends behind me as well as the girl I was with  she is now my fianc lol and they pinched every penny to pay the cost of defense something I am blessed for Then I noticed that nobody believed me guilty I showed the reports anyone who would listen like a freak  The courts though they didn t care The prosecutor on my case reviewed the data dump of my phone  all her messages her threats of false accusation to me and others her harassment after the fact apologizing for everything etc and the photographic evidence I put forward and added an additional felony I was facing FIFTEEN YEARS in prison My ex harassing me every day didn t matter my evidence didn t matter her blatantly inconsistent statements throughout didn t matter I was at a loss  One month before resolution my family retained a new attorney who had been a DV prosecutor for the most liberal county in Colorado for more than half of her career In this time the original prosecutor on my case was fired for undisclosed reasons Still they would not dismiss it I was offered a deferred deal of  months of probation and   hours of community service and I could plea Alford  maintain innocence and accept the sentence  The case would be dismissed at the end and the record sealed  for all time   My family and my now fianc wanted me to keep going but it was destroying me and destroying them Not only had I lost almost everything they had too We sold everything and my grandfather no longer has a retirement I could not live with what I had done to them anymore and my attorney said that trial was risky because even if they just convicted me of low class misdemeanor harassment my future would be destroyed anyway I took the  deal  The statute for harassment in Colorado criminalizes everything and if you don t believe me look it up  The case is set to be dismissed and sealed in mid July but healthcare licensing departments are exempt from the sealing order  the list of exempt entities is longer than you would think and I cannot find out if they will approve me for licensure unless I go through all the schooling and try Myself my fianc  my parents and my grandfather packed up and left Colorado We are the first to do so in over a hundred years The individuals involved in probation and the treatment they make you do believe I am innocent They have been kinder than I expected and have done everything they can to help but their hands are tied in most ways My ex continues to harass me monthly and has admitted through traceable electronic means that she lied about it all I have posted an example here so you can see  it s in my post history as well  I get death threats from her criminal friends weekly The state of Colorado does not care They will not file charges nor will they vacate them I can attempt to file civilly to the tune of      k that I nor anyone in my family has anymore It has cost nearly        not including the costs post plea We are financially destitute at this point and I have to live with destroying my family s lives This is the face of false accusations Lives are destroyed every day Not just the men whom are accused but any who stand with them I barely made it out alive and tens of thousands of others at a minimum live like this This must end We cannot as a society abide this anymore I lived through regular sexual assault as a child at the hands of a woman I was beaten daily the first ten years of my life by the same woman She faced no repercussions I was beaten again by a woman and faced the extinction of everything I had sought to achieve and she faced no repercussions despite admitting she lied and everything else I have said I can tell you having lived through all that that there is no more horrible thing to live through than a false accusation I would live through my childhood a hundred times before going through this once I am still broken and slowly picking up the pieces of my shattered life and I still do not know if it will ever be the same again I know that MRA s stand with men like me I know that we can do this I am begging you and the world do not leave the falsely accused behind There are too many of us who s voices are silenced forever That is why I keep going  PS I am willing to back up everything I have said here I ve got a nice fat dump of thousands of texts photos witnesses all the case files everything I am not full of shit
MensRights,1615905517,I read feminist post and it makes me wanna blow my brains out Like the fact that they are so uneducated is just amazing It s funny when you pin them in an argument and they won t have anything to say Another great thing is that they work  together but once one of them does something wrong they act like none of them even know each other I wonder what they will do when so many false rape accusations come out that people will start not believing anyone so when a real rape victim comes out no one is going to believe her They are fighting for nothing and they are never to accomplish anything nuff said
MensRights,1613068275,I was talking to a   year old young man and he told me that when he was    for a whole Summer he would have sex with a   year old woman on her husband s yacht  He told me that the first time he was in a paddle boat and as he approached a yacht a topless woman called him and told him to climb aboard They ended having intercourse regularly for several weeks This happened while her elderly husband was either away or sleeping below deck The crazy thing is that the boy s mother knew what was going on and saw nothing wrong So no police report was made When I asked him to mentally reverse the roles and picture an adult man inviting a   year old girl onto his yacht for sexual intercourse he realised that what had happened was illegal

MensRights,1613055604,I have seen a lot of  teach men not to rape type conversations play out  Usually one one side you have a person wearing a feminist mask who will say something like  gt You have every right to live your best life  Be yourself  Express yourself  Dress how you like and go where you please      gt Nothing that you do will make a man entitled to your body or your sexuality  gt If a man looks at you in a way that makes you uncomfortable  have him arrested or thrown out or have your brother kill him as is your right       gt Assuming you are of legal age you have the right to drink and your drinking does not give men the right to rape you  If under the effects of alcohol you beg a man to take you home and nail you to the wall  of if you just find yourself dropping to your knees and pawing at his jeans  you have been raped        On the other side we have a person who says this is a bad policy  who recommends women NOT place themselves in such situations   He will be accused of  victim blaming but I often find his arguments compelling  How was the  rapist to know that yes did not mean yes  How could he have known that she was drunk  what if he was drunk himself   Well  it s     and I begin to see a new species of this dilemma  It has not fully gelled yet in the wider discourse so I have no handy name for it  for lack of a better name I will call it the  teach women not to use the tools we have given them and begged them to use argument   One one side we have a person wearing a  men are human beings mask  who says things like    gt You have sexuality and that is OK  You can be attracted to women  it does not make you a monster  You can ask a woman out  that does not make you a rapist     The conversation has not fully formed yet  and because he has never been challenged he does not need to add  gt And if she takes this the wrong way and decides  for her own safety and the safety of all women  to have you expelled or fired or murdered or jailed  as is her right  well that s on her  It s not your fault  You do you take your chances  maybe you will survive  maybe   And because the conversation is only beginning there is no clear other side  no one saying    gt Men  this is self destructive  Do not place yourself in such danger  Avoid women  they have the legal right to have you jailed on a whim  You have no defense  Many of them have been taught that they have a moral imperative to beg their friends and families to kill you  and their friends and families will jump at the chance    gt Avoid women  Do not engage  Do not make eye contact

MensRights,1613044770,  Basically France wants to set an age of consent to   and eliminate problems by not having an official one    is average in Europe  and although it seems good a justice minister said that penetration is what makes it rape Not the best wording and immediately raised a red flag in my mind Also when they write about what Olivier Duhamel did with his stepson they call the accusations just abuse instead of rape Looked it up almost every source calls it abuse and only mentions rape when they write about the actual legal side of how difficult it is right now to prove that something was rape they don t seem to be calling those incidents rape At least this is something   A notable change is the  MeTooGay movement gaining momentum which details long suppressed sexual abuse against gay boys and men   But not enough also I don t think all children under   know their sexual orientation I m not French but I hope they won t make the mistake of limiting what rape against children can be to men raping girls or men raping gay boys

MensRights,1613028251,So I just found out that fetishizing is a thing people care about My immediate thought was it s kind of a matter of perspective If you re a person who can have sex almost at will sure you might have a problem with that But if you re a person that receiveds so little interest from the opposite sex that you barely notice it when you get it being fetishized seems like a boon I m a black male We don t even need to go into the stereotypes we re all well versed Matter of fact we re probably the MOST fetishized men Those stereotypes are probably a good chunk of the reason I ve ever dated hooked up with ANY non black women Am I saying pol s feelings don t matter or that all black men feel like me No But what I am saying is THAT IT MUST BE NICE TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU RE SO SOUGHT AFTER THAT YOU GET TO CRITICIZE THE REASON YOU GET IT

MensRights,1612987912,I made this post on another sub and someone told me it would be a good idea to post it here as well I always thought that sexism be it misogyny or misandry can be best understood through experience I am transsexual which means that I have experienced both being perceived as a woman and as a man by society So here s my experience Background I m ftm transsexual I spent the first   years of my life as a girl woman and these last  as a man My experiences as a woman The good Most people treated me very well and those who didn t mistreated me because I m autistic not because I was a girl I was never made to feel bad whenever I asked for help and when I did people were happy to help me Guys were happy to help with emotional issues particularly They were always happy to be there for me if I needed to talk Overall my mental health and well being was taken more seriously Additionally it was easier to make friends It just seemed like others were more comfortable around me and felt safe to open up more around me The bad Nothing really I never experienced misogyny  and I grew up in yeehaw land  I wasn t exactly attractive so I never received sexual romantic attention from guys be it positive or negative When it came to other girls there were a few that were shitty but I think this too would have been worse if I was attractive as they would see me as competition My experiences as a man The good Socially nothing really improved I hear some people say that men are taken more seriously especially when it comes to the work place But at my work men and women are treated the same I am more confident now but that s because my gender dysphoria has lessoned considerably The bad I don t ask for help much anymore especially when it comes to my mental health Whenever I do ask for help people are less enthusiastic about helping me And I ve also noticed that the quality of help I receive has decreased I find that it s harder to talk to people They just don t seem as comfortable around me anymore nor does it seem that they trust me nearly as much it s hard to make friends compared to a couple of years ago People just treat me neutrally and sometimes even negatively I noticed strangers are more wary around me Nothing like pulling their kids closer or clutching their purses tighter but they stay farther away and don t make as much eye contact  not that I mind but I m sure many people would  Final thoughts It was a very jarring experience I went from being treated how a person should be treated  trusted listened to supported etc  To being treated like well a man In my experience I ve been treated far worse as a man I by no means regret transitioning in any way but I do wish that someone would have warned me about this Keep in mind my experiences are my own For some people it can be very different Additionally I ve only been treated as a man for  years now Maybe that  male privilege I ve been hearing about will kick in soon  s Or maybe I ll just more and worse misandry especially as I progress in my transition and become even more masculine  Shared from r LeftWingMaleAdvocates

MensRights,1613352671,What is the best age to circumcise  Circumcision removes healthy genital tissue that is prima facie valuable while imposing  the risk of a number of surgical complications ranging from mild to severe the full extent of which is understudied and unknown The favorable attitude of non voluntary neonatal male circumcision  proponents toward the procedure appears to be at odds with that taken towards medically unnecessary surgeries more generally especially when the affected person cannot consent      Accordingly from a moral point of view which includes a medical cost benefit analysis as only one part of the overall ethical analysis we find that medically unnecessary circumcision should not be performed on minors who cannot provide ethically valid consent to the procedure   Neonatally circumcised homosexual males or heterosexual males who practice safe sex will receive virtually no HIV related benefit whilst bearing the burden of unsafe choices made by others It is also worth remembering that circumcision is not a failsafe intervention it does not prevent HIV  or any other sexually transmitted infection  Rather it may merely reduce one s risk of contracting the virus by around half per coital act assuming  for the sake of argument that the African findings are both accurate and generalizable   The point is that no one other than the owner of the penis is better positioned to determine whether they wish to assume the risk that circumcision might permanently compromise their sexual enjoyment A person who seeks circumcision in adulthood also has the advantage of  being able to explain to the surgeon exactly how they want the procedure performed   In the case of an adult any complications that do occur are the result of a procedure that was voluntarily undertaken after the adult had been informed about the nature and likelihood of these very risks This is not possible in the case of the neonate or young child  Generally speaking risks imposed on a person who is aware of the risks and agrees to assume them in light of their own considered preferences and values are much less morally objectionable than risks imposed on a person who is not aware of the risks and or does not agree to assume them

MensRights,1613220859,It s no secret the US Family Court system is discriminatory against fathers gaining and retaining custody of their children Some states are really good about considering both sides but some like mine just believe the mother because shes the mother They CRY  shes the mother she has rights  but what about the father What about his rights What about the kids rights What about the child s right to not be abused In too many cases that I ve seen the father is the obvious choice yet custody is still granted to the mother who just abuses the kids  Let me tell you a little bit of my and my fathers story I was born in the US to my amazing father and my thundercunt mother I m not exactly clear on the time line but I know meth was involved before my birth I know my mother was using it when I was in utero But it wasnt long after my birth that my father told thundercunt he had enough of the meth and they needed to stop NOW She didnt like that and after a physical altercation there was a legal battle where she had falsely accused my dad of rape and assault It was so obviously a lie my dad got off with only a minor assault charge that he got only because he took a plea to get me back  Meanwhile me and my  half sister are living with thundercunt her boyfriend and his kid Let s just say it wasnt good for us We had almost lethal amounts of meth in our system we were starved beaten and our childhood ruined from the start But Sisters dad got her tested for drugs and when that much meth was found in her system we were taken and she was given to her dad I was given to my maternal grandparents for about  months But I was taken after more neglect specifically medical care Then I went to my dad again I lived with my dad from  to   And there I had an actual childhood So many good memories we share from that time One of my favorites is that when my dad had a day off he would take me to this awesome amusement park Hed tell me we were going there and I d be so excited I drop whatever I was doing  probably drawing on my big easel and I d be running out of the house half dressed Hed have to chase after me like  Babygirl Come back You need your pants on  Wed get there and my dad would be conservative with his money of course but one day I reeeeeallllly wanted to go on the go cart track again after we had spend all the money loaded onto our pass My dad just tried it even if nothing was on it   and it worked  He asked the staff at the ride how many credits he had left and he had over the max credits Whoever last loaded that card made it a master card where you cant run out of credits My dad says he thinks it was a mistake But I think we ran into a certain staff member who saw this dad with his little hyperactive shadow who was just so excited to be there with her dad They probably noticed my dad didnt have terribly much to load onto the card so they made it into a master card Why the hell not It s just a button on their computer away And we certainly deserved it It s amazing the little kindnesses you ll notice if you look around  But anyway from day one my dad and I have been two peas in a pod I am him just little and female One glance at us and its obvious And we go perfectly together even in conflict we still have that harmony I was a really easy kid I was fine doing my own thing most of the time and even though I liked playing with other kids I didnt need other kids to feel content I m a quick learner I just need the how what and why answered and I understand But I definitely struggled with some things really hard Coordination to name one I d eat shit pretty much everyday Once I hit school age my dad knew from my teachers and his observations that I obviously had a learning disability of some kind  Then re enter thundercunt Thundercunt left us alone until I was  which was when she wanted visitation My dad fought hard against it because I didn t want to see her AT ALL But in the end he had HIS OWN LAWYER AGREE that she should be allowed visitation So then I started having supervised visits with her And those were fine only a couple of hours Then she got overnight unsupervised visitation And things got weird I d come home and for a few days I d be in this weird mood I d be shut off shit down nervous anxious unable to sit down and not very responsive I wouldnt look him in the eye When my dad would press me a little for answers as to what happened during these visits I d be very vague never giving him a clear answer Which that just isnt me I was a joyous kid Ask me a question and I ll answer  more you didnt know you had And whenever my daddy said my name he immediately got my attention and my eyes This just wasnt me at all And what made my dad even more nervous is that when he asked who was there during the visit I said  Mommy told me not tell you who was there  So then thundercunt starts to pick on my dad for every little mark on my body accusing him of abusing me She tries to make a CPS case against him over every little thing But all the marks were from me eating shit all the goddamn time So it wasn t working for her Until one day I had a mark on my face from the dog and thundercunt said I had a bite on my face My dad checked again and again and there no such thing But the next day when I had a visit with her I had a huge bite mark on my face And it was ugly I never got to talk to my dad after that to tell him what happened Thundercunt took me into her work during our visit and into the bathroom She kissed my check then bit me and HARD She apologized and locked me in an office as I cried She left me there who knows how long and then called the police at her work  And I was taken away I was given to my maternal grandparents then my thundercunt mother And I hated it I just shut down I became chronically depressed at age   She tried at first I could tell but it wasnt long before I was being locked in my bedroom for hours and hours I had my first suicide attempt at age  because I felt so alone and sad She hated me even mentioning my dad I d get hit if I dared refer to him anything other than a sperm donor  My dad fell into depression too suicide attempts too   But child support took so much of his money It got to a point he was only getting     of his paycheck a month And they took away his professional license so he couldn t work then his driver s license so he couldnt even drive to work if he wanted to and it just got him stuck in this hole And of course he never got visitation with me When he went to court for his visitation  thundercunt got a slap on the wrist and was told to attend visitation But she never did So my dad was stuck going into debt because of child support he was paying for the little girl he couldnt even see anymore  As the years go on thundercunt gets a boyfriend who s a peice of shit A MONSTER I ll spare you the gorey details but from age      this dude physically emotionally mentally sexually financially ritualistically and religiously abused me and other kids they took in They drugged me to abuse me make me forget and manipulate me It s a horror movie like situation I tried many times to report them to CPS but COS would come around investigate talk to thundercunt tell her EVERYTHING I TOLD THEM then leave me at home with them again They seemed to care about what I had to say until they talked to thundercunt who would tell them I am developmentally disabled and the case would be dismissed on that note Or thundercunt threatened me into dismissing the case  After I hit   they kicked me out with nothing No life skills no money no job not even a high school diploma So I was homeless most of      But they were still claiming I was living with them for child support  Now me and my dad have been reunited and we re going to be seeking justice for the both of us We couldn t be happier just being together again Which just goes to show we shouldn t have ever been separated in the first place  The sad ing is that this isnt close to the only story like this I ve heard If I had a dollar for everytime I heard about a similar situation I d have enough to pay for my college tuition   So yeah the family court is against men and it shouldn t  be just because of a spike of father led abuse almost    years ago This needs to stop because I am a lucky one who made it out I didnt make it out okay or even in one piece but I made it out So many dont make it out Either they re killed or they just shut themselves off to everyone GIVE BOTH PARENTS A FAIR CHANCE AT CUSTODY STOP ASSUMING THE MOTHER IS THE BEST 
MensRights,1613607040,Hey guys I just started a podcast to work on trying to struggle my way through some harder conversations talking to friends and professionals who have different viewpoints than me I feel like the tribalism and group think dynamics that social media is teaching us is killing the art of the conversation so I wanted to work on getting better and speaking and listening for long periods of time  long enough periods of time that I could begin to genuinely get to know people and perspectives that I don t understand That s the project of  This Could Be Interesting  In this first episode I took some time to talk to my friend Ken Paradis who s a lit professor at Laurier University in Brantford Ontario He has a bunch of interesting things to say about religion especially evangelicalism and cultural identity We took some time to sit down and talk through some of his ideas and ended up spending a lot of time trying to sort out the role of masculinity in the modern postmodern postpostmodern world    If you make it through our fumbling around let me know if you agree with any of the points we made What does masculinity even mean Is it defined by society evolution both or neither Does it have something to do with individuality I don t know exactly but I m still working on trying to figure it out

MensRights,1613542897,Hi I don t usually do things like this but It s     AM and I found something which made me so upset and angry and I feel like if I don t let this out I ll explode this is difficult for me to talk about it here s the video   A few years back  when I was    a girl from my class used the defenetition sexual harrassment to get me kicked out of a college  It was from a FB message I didn t write and that I apologised for  She not only said this message was harassment but also fabricated things I didn t even say  this was as a revenge for a series of unrelated events between me and her  the principle  woman and deputy principle  man took me in  while I was accompanied by my dad not only did they not ask or listen to my side of the story in any way but the principle started screaming and shouting at me  and my dad calling me  underdeveloped and essentially making me out to be a sexual abuser while the deputy principle just powertripped and said things to me to get effect Even when my dad argued with them they didn t budge  amp  x   B After this experience I left my country  Ireland honestly for the better because this college wasn t benefitting me I found myself feeling dirty and ashamed over having any kind of sexual thought I had trouble even looking at an attractive woman  It made me feel weird which hard to explain on here It also made masturbation very difficult and my libido was continually getting lower  I m getting over the experience but my libido is still very low I also felt very humiliated and was unable to talk to my dad for a long time I only recently addressed this with him last month actually My problems with this video   It makes incredibly angry when the media or people act as If men don t understand boundaries or how not to abuse women as if they re animals with no morals    sexual harassment by defenition even though it was and is still sometimes a legitmate problem is way too vague and which can cause alot of problems  this is just my personal opinion and this isn t new It s actually been like this since the    s   Women abuse and sexually harass men too and this is continually ignored   alot of young men have issues with sexual shame guilt psychological problems etc and I really feel all this just backs these anxieties and problems up I ve been trying to avoid this stuff as much as possible as of late but I just really slipped up tonight I really hope this idea of men needing to learn consent ends eventually but It s hard to tell If I said something that might be considered offensive I do apologise this just really had an effect on me and I had to let it out somehow

MensRights,1613478480,Found this in an article in a site called swaddle It s from india and by their logic and reasoning men can t be victims of sexism I can t comprehend this idea and do care to enlighten me  Finally feminism can t be sexist towards men because of how oppression works It has a unidirectional systemic flow from a group at the top that has social and cultural sanction to misuse power toward the group at the bottom Patriarchy hurts everyone  even men  but as long as men are in a greater position of social power that allows them to oppress women culturally socially legally and financially they can t be victims of sexism  This is the link to the article   arguments against feminism research data  
MensRights,1613470834,So it s just a little thing I d like to share  I live in a post soviet country so it s already a bit depressing But that s besides the point What I want to talk about is the military  In my country if you re a man  from   to twenty something  don t remember it of the top my head you get called for an examination  to determine if you re  fit to serve twice a year And starting at   if you don t have a good reason not to join the army  I e chronic illnesses broken bones but that only helps for a time being gay for just not straight also works here you might just get enlisted against you will and send to peel potatoes god knows where  If you re not showing up you can get fined and even jailed  Getting higher education helps because if you prove that you re actually studying they ll stop bothering you for around  years  And it s not like the examination itself is any good I can really find the words here the best I can come up with is  dehumanizing  There isn t really a single part of the process that all that bad it s just doctors who aren t interested in anything asking you things and checking if you really have these problems But the part that just pisses me off is the last part you just walk in a room alone with a doctor and he just goes over every health problem you claimed to have And I get it they re trying to figure out if you re just lying to get out of service But the whole process is so god damn frustrating because at every turn they just assume you re a piece of crap who never tells the truth and every proof you present is also crap  It s obvious that only men have to go through this And in my opinion the whole process wouldn t be too bad if not for the societal pressure of it all If you don t want to join the army most teachers  only in school treat you like shit for not wanting to slave away a year of your life I mean my own dad didn t serve he just worked in construction when he was in uni  in the USSR  yet he always says that I m a wimp  or something like that Language barrier and so on for not wanting to work for free for a year  Quite a lot of people think that it s fine that a man has to either serve or he s not a man  There s always getting a contract but it pays relatively little and lasts a minimum of  years It is also almost impossible to get a contract because the bar is set very high But that s only for men Women have the bar set unbelievably low plus they get a payed education guaranteed after service  Sorry for the rant just needed to get it off my back Also sorry for mistakes in grammar second language and all

MensRights,1613454092,I ve been trawling through UN documents and in the lastest one the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women comes right out and states redistribution of power and resources to women is one of their goals The Committee makes recommendations to States This one was about the application of  temporary special measures which are intended to make up for discrimination  Here are a couple of choice quotes which I found shocking   General recommendation No    Article   paragraph   of the Convention  temporary special measures    amp  x   B  gt    Measures taken under article   paragraph   by States parties should aim to accelerate the equal participation of women in the political economic social cultural civil or any other field The Committee views the application of these measures not as an exception to the norm of nondiscrimination but rather as an emphasis that temporary special measures are part of a necessary strategy by States parties directed towards the achievement of de facto or substantive equality of women with men in the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms While the application of temporary special measures often remedies the effects of past discrimination against women   the obligation of States parties under the Convention to improve the position of women to one of de facto or substantive equality with men exists irrespective of any proof of past discrimination   The Committee considers that States parties that adopt and implement such measures under the Convention do not discriminate against men  amp  x   B  gt    Although the application of temporary special measures may not be possible under all the articles of the Convention the Committee recommends that their adoption be considered whenever issues of accelerating access to equal participation on the one hand   and accelerating the redistribution of power and resources   on the other hand are involved as well as where it can be shown that these measures will be necessary and most appropriate under the circumstances    Source PDF

MensRights,1613409280,I ve been raising hell any time I encounter someone who uses the sexist and hateful slur  mansplaining   I wrote a letter of complaint to the Mars Corporation over their use of the term in their Super Bowl ad  There is no legitimate use of this word  It s used to shut down discussion via shaming and it implies that a man s explanation is automatically invalid based on gender alone  Our society would never tolerate targeting other groups with this kind of word creation  Imagine if a major company like Mars had used words like  jewsplaining   blacksplaining   femsplaining  or even  chinasplaining   There would be an uproar and rightfully so  So I wrote them back to let them know that s not acceptable   I ve also complained on social media any time someone uses that bigoted word  It s a word dreamed up by hateful feminists to denigrate men  There is no legitimate use of it  I ve seen feminists claim it s needed to express the idea of a man explaining to a woman in a condescending way but that s a cop out  That s still stereotyping men as people who act that way  Condescending speech has no gender  We have non gender biased terms in English for expressing that idea   I ve encountered people being very surprised that someone would object to this term  They try to belittle me to shut me up by saying the same old cliches like  fragile male ego   which is another sexist and hateful term   But I won t back down  I ve had it up to here with this bigoted term and so I m fighting back   I m curious if any of my brothers out there have had similar experiences and what you ve done to fight back against this hate speech  I won t stand for this hypocritical and sexist word being normalized  There are other man bashing  sexist terms but this is the one that really disgusts me   If you ve been fighting back as well please let me hear from you  But if you wish to write to try to justify this term of hate please don t bother  You should not try to justify misandry on a men s rights board  You can go find some other forum where this type of hate speech is tolerated   But to those of you who have been fighting back against this bigotry thank you

MensRights,1613404606,Yes I generalized the question just so you can make a sense out of it for me I m a big puzzle enthusiast and love everything about them   important   Someone was arguing with me about how it s unfair that men and women don t compete against each other I gave her not one but three examples and she told me that they don t count These are the examples   There are competitions for Rubik s cube type twisty puzzles known as speed cube competitions In those competitions both guys and girls compete against each other to get the fastest time There are many types of events for multiple puzzles But most of the time both guys and girls are competing against each other   The same is the case with chess Both men and women compete against each other Yes there might be events for women only or men only but it doesn t mean men and women don t compete against each other even in a professional competition   Similarly in the competition of Sudoku both men and women compete against each other I m sure there are a lot but these were the ones that came on top of my head Generally speaking I may not know any competitions related to strength but I know at least  competitions related to wits where men and women compete with each other Why is it that these examples don t count if they are not that famous or not related to strength As a puzzle enthusiast my opinion might be biased in favour of puzzles so I would like your opinion about it

MensRights,1613699823,To be honest I was very surprised to see this sympathetic article from the ABC  Australian Broadcasting Corporation  since my impression is the ABC is very pro feminists and anti men s issues  I m glad to be demonstrated to be wrong in this case at least    ABC article here   
MensRights,1613697172,I came across a interesting fact recently In a survey done by the CDC in      the most recent gender comparison survey by the CDC  called the  National Intimate Partner and Sexual Abuse Survey   more men reported intimate partner domestic abuse then women  I will be rounding to the thousand in this post for simplicity           men reported it compared to          women Now we already know women will victim blame men so let me drop that right here The difference between these two numbers is around          which would be    of intimate partner domestic abuse reported in this survey Domestic abuse in gay relationships is thought to be about    so let s do the math That would be        of the total           So now we still have a        difference between both numbers and          cases left Since we accounted for homosexual relationships all of those          cases are women abusing men Now to be fair we will take the    lesibian and gay relationship abuse is about the same and subtract that from the           Now since the same amount was from both sides we have a difference of        again and the numbers for women are now           all come by men Now that we ve accounted for homesexual relationships and covered all the statistical mumbo jumbo we can get to the interesting part If men are abused so much more in relationships then why are abusive relationships stereotyped as men abusing women and women get more support in this aspect   They twisted the narrative and told half the truth As an major example of them getting more support let s talk about the good ol VAWA  or was it VAVA  Basically they use government money to support intimate domestic abuse shelters and such But they have a large bias against men  mEn CaNt bE AbUsed ThEy ArE StRoNgEr and won t fund men s domestic abuse shelters but will gladly give money to a women only one On top of that this bias actually harms men in abusive relationships a lot Not only are they usually turned down from most domestic abuse shelters they are even arrested after they call the police for help because they assume  man stronger  man instigator  Now why are people ignoring this It s because feminism told white lies and made  reinforced stereotypes of men being abusive There s basically this same attitude towards men being raped but that s a different story And the worst thing about it is feminists always victim blame and say  well men are the ones doing it  I already disproved that and  it s the patriarchy s fault  feminism slang for  some men were in power   years ago so it s mens fault for all this  It may sound like I m going a bit over the top here but it s just so hypocritical Any suggestions comments This is my first time making such a large post on such a large topic

MensRights,1613647099,Just want to preface this by saying that I am a trans guy A female to male trans person for those that don t know I m a masculine man in all aspects of my life  Growing up as a man with a female body I got to see the true side of womanhood I can t say I stopped being a feminist after I begun to transition because I never was one Even when the world viewed me as a woman I never agreed with modern day feminism and I never agreed in the saying that men were evil  Woman were always the ones who put me down Tried to put me in these little boxes Told me things like all men were rapists and that every time I leave the house I had a   percent chance to be kidnapped raped and murdered And yet all my best friends throughout my life have been males They ve never judged me never put me down nothing Men have always been there for me when I needed it Women Not so much  As I ve transitioned I realized that men actually had life hard More expectations harder work shorter life span having to hide emotions always being shit on etc Yet I can honestly say that I enjoy being a man I like myself I have some dope ass dudes in my life and for the first time I have no female friends and my life is actually drama free  I think women need to take a step back and stop being assholes to men and fear mongering the Hell out of young girls into hating us Most of us just want to live our lives But it seems like being a man is the worst thing these days

MensRights,1613625098, At my high school I had this incident with this one girl and she ended up claiming rape even though it didn t happen Then some of her friends joined her and added some fake stories to add credibility and went public  I guess my question is how to prove my innocence to a public that ll believe whatever the girls say even when it s not true 
MensRights,1613625096,The law ratio  laws lobbied for by feminists for women and for men and growing bias towards men shows the original motives of the  st wave Since people didn t have stats and surveys to see the downsides of being men they meant by equality to move up and be equal that way because they saw the obvious fact they were put below men therefore they mean  get better laws to be on par with men rather then  make men and women equal in all ways which explains why the act the way they act and why it doesn t seem to live up with the latter defention They didn t know how bad it was I think this makes fair sense do you agree

MensRights,1613614239,I absolutely hate how people say men need to talk about their feelings more That if only they talked about their feelings more like women they wouldn t commit suicide  When homosexual teens were committing suicide disproportionately as recently as the early      s it wasn t because society was discriminating against them or treating them as sub human It was because they didn t cry enough When Natives commit suicide it isn t because they d been marginalized from greater society and face abuse it s because they need to cry more  Right It has nothing to do with any of the societal injustices that create the depression in the first place It has nothing to do with fathers losing their children and all their assets in a divorce It has nothing to do with being displaced at work by an under qualified woman It has nothing to do with blatant discrimination in schools It has nothing to do with lack of social services which women have plenty of It has nothing to do with false accusations that destroy a reputation and a life     we just need to cry more

MensRights,1613867100,I just got out of this mess happening and thought I needed to vent a bit to get this thing out of my mind and move on with the movie I was watching beforehand     So I a        cm engineering student live in a condo  many houses enclosed by a wall with my family for the time being during the pandemic My brother was playing football in the courtyard when out of nowhere a dog comes running in his direction and grabs the ball out of his feet and proceeds to destroy the ball We my family is pretty close to our neighbors and the dog was not familiar  which directly led him to think it might have rabies which is why we didn t fight back  He get s home is very sad and irritated because it was his only birthday present for last year  of course no party thanks to COVID and says the dog is still in the courtyard and is worried he may go after the balls that were still there from the younger kids from the other side of the street My father who has a history of very complicating diseases and if catches the virus is sure to be dead within the week goes out to help me pick up the other balls and we proceed to lock the dog in the court to keep it from running away before we find it s owner     Right after we do that we hear one of our  what pandemic  female neighbors who parties every week coming out calling the dog s name and obviously does not have a mask on I repeat  five times calling her to  put your mask on as she hurries down the hill She stops no more than   cm   foot from my face when I tell her  will I have to hold you back  and she replies with  If you touch me I ll call the cops on you   Nervous but level minded as I could be I reply with  No problem now put on your mask  She goes right back to her house picks a mask goes down the hill no problem and I even make sure to get at least   feet away from her She picks up her dog says we can put the destroyed ball on her mom s check and we both head back to our respective houses     Now it is important to point out that this was only the second time I really interacted with this woman and the first one was when we she threw a party right when I had just come back from S o Paulo doing some volunteering at a hospital there  I ll just say I could not last long there  It s also very critical to point out that nobody is vaccinated yet and she know my fathers medical history pretty well     A few minutes after we get back this girl s mother calls saying that her daughter was threatened by my that I grabbed her and basically assaulted her I would not be too worried in many circumstances but the damn girl in a freaking lawyer with  month old baby  who did not deter her from partying like crazy of course and threatened to sue me for assault     And the worst part is my parents are now shouting at me saying that I m on my own and that the whole judicial system is geared against me and if there are expenses I ll have to find a job to pay it All because I DID NOT WANT MY FATHER DEAD     I m gonna be honest that I really want to move out and get on with in person school as soon as I possibly can Those friends who really know me know I could not hurt a damn bee if I wanted to  generally I just spend way too much time trying to get them to fly back through the window to safety   and now I m scared to death because I now that just an accusation like that regardless of court decision could haut me for the rest of my life According to my parents she won t bring charges or anything but I should not be so scared for my life just because of standing my ground and telling her to put on a mask during a fucking once in a hundred years pandemic that may I just remind you guys has killed more Americans than the entirety of WWII     I m just angry scared tired and just want to get back to working on telescopes and spacecraft like I was a year ago       If you guys have any advice I would greatly appreciate it I m just a young person and have never felt so scared of having been born with the wrong bits down there   If it helps I m based on the southernmost state of Brazil       Just to prove how non  alpha male I am the movie I was watching in Notting Hill  I know I know 
MensRights,1613865746,First of all please don t ban me I like reading and interacting with posts on this subreddit Second of all most of the posts on this subreddit make me more aware of problems but  the comments blame women and generalize women as if all women do this You complain about feminists doing this but do it yourselves People act like some men don t contribute to hurtful comments about men   You can t be abused by a woman  You can t be raped by a woman  You re gay if you paint your nails A lot of people in this world have old views on how the sexes should act women should clean or whatever men should do physical work whatever But both women and MEN can contribute to these telling young boys they shouldn t cry or express their emotions isn t good it was mostly the women in my life that told me I shouldn t play soccer because it isn t  ladylike Literally anyone can make offensive comments If I see a post that implicitly blames men for rape which I have before on the  Feminist account on Instagram and I say that rape can happen to anyone including boys and men    my comment gives off  All lives matter energy but to this sub im a patriot who doesn t blame men for everything  rightly so   but if I mention that men can also contribute to hurtful comments about men and boys on this sub I m  disregarding what happens to men just to mention that Women don t do everything I know that people will assume I ma feminist just because I mention this but it s true Stop acting like the people no one likes
MensRights,1613863315,A comment that I made to another post about the MRM vs Men s Liberation The men s rights movement was an inevitable and required pushback against feminism No ideology should be allowed to run unchecked  Think Nazi Germany and North Korea  A pushback is necessary to keep them from having absolute power or disaster ensues From a feminists perspective feminism was the inevitable and required pushback to the  patriarchy  I despise that term btw   Feminism wants to quash the patriarchy  I think that is pretty standard methodology for all feminism Even though the patriarchy doesn t exist but that s besides the point Did they expect that society would just give into all their demands without question That s where the MRM comes into play Men s Liberation lol This is a feminist construct to make it look like feminism is good for men It isn t Feminism isn t going to  liberate men Look at what feminism has done to due process and innocent until proven guilty Two of the pillars of modern democracy and the legal system No There is a response to every ideology  There has to be And the MRM is the required response Not Men s Liberation   And I m going to listen to the one that the ideology in question doesn t want you to hear Not the one that it does Because I m smarter than that

MensRights,1613961784, So I had a friend who got falsely accused of rape And I ve been thinking of this almost problem for a while but can you ever completely prove one received consent  It just seems like almost anything can be said to vitiate consent at any time But to me more accurate this is my example in words Let s say this guy does it all He asks the girl for verbal consent before he starts periodically he checks up on her to make sure the consent is still ongoing The girl is completely sober Etc etc  Then she goes and claims rape And her argument is yes I consented but I only did it out of fear as the man is a  ft      lb African American varsity athlete  Can one even argue against that The only argument I even see that could go against that would be arguing that one is not a physical threat And that seems impossible given the stats
MensRights,1613953187,While circumcision is an perfect example of male disposability effecting male children   there are also other examples of male disposability effecting male children too Like an example is that boys are more likely to get in trouble at schools than girls are even if the girl is misbehaving more than the boy is Also I heard that a study found that female teachers are likely to grade students tests lower when they knew the test taker was a boy And also in movies and in TV shows and in other forms of fiction male children are much more likely to be shown getting hurt or killed than female children are That really makes me mad since male children are just as vulnerable as female children are and they deserve the same protection and respect that they get

MensRights,1613937742,On the Ben Shapiro show there is a point where Ben talks about Harry Styles wearing a dress and complains about it At one point he talks about how a woman he knows admitted she would punch her husband for wearing something like that He treats this as perfectly okay This woman is objectively an abusive wife but Ben Shapiro is fine with that He says nothing even implying he has a problem with it On his sister s channel  Classically Abby she complains about the same thing and literally objectifies him claiming that he should stop wearing the dress because he doesn t find it fuckable This is literally a gender bent version of classic misogyny It didn t even occur to her that this is a questionable thing to say In fact multiple Republicans have expressed similar opinions It is perfectly normal among these people to tell men to change themselves to cater to their personal tastes The insistence on manly men is the same as the insistence on feminine women 
MensRights,1613931170,Hi so this is kinda a story analysis of the stuff that made me an MRA and my experiences with sexism Let s start from the beginning During my childhood my mother was emotionally manipulative and abusive towards me my sister and her husband As a kid I always felt like home was a potential war zone as we never knew when she was going to snap and start yelling and emotionally abusing us I never really had any connections as a kid and felt all alone  During my early school years I found it hard to make friends and was often sad I tended to be reserved and ungodly quiet It didn t help that much of the trauma from at home stuck with me throughout most of the day I would sometimes try to tell my teachers about how I didn t like seeing my mother so upset at my father  she primarily yelled at him but would also yell at me an my sister from time to time  and they would just say that that s what all parents do During my later years of school I did eventually make friends and opened up a bit more to others My mother still berated me and my family during this time During my middle school years and elementary school years I always felt inferior to the teachers  who were primarily female as well as the girls in my grade I think it was mostly due to my situation with my mother at home It still didn t help with my self esteem During high school I transferred school systems and I was back at having zero friends I was shy as usual and felt like an outsider During this time the modern wave of feminism was starting to creep in as well as the     election During high school many of the male degradation campaigns started to creep into the high school and lectures Also I was online a bit more and more of the things about how men are unable to know what pain is or are inherently inferior This is where some of my MRA attitudes came into play I knew that being treated as a lesser being was not right and I would not bow down to the women who were  constantly being oppressed and unable to be mean or abusive because I knew dang well that was a lie I had seen and felt firsthand how women could be abusive and that men had their own set of problems just like them During college is when it really took off I started college in      and this is when stuff was really getting out of hand for radical feminism and anti male propaganda While I  thankfully was never accused of assaulting or raping anyone it still didn t mean that my experience was positive During freshman orientation we were given a speech on sexual assault and rape Not once did they mention men being victims It also didn t help that I was very sexually inexperienced at this time unlike everyone else I didn t have a girlfriend or boyfriend since high school or right before college so some of the stuff they were saying about sexual assault and rape was new to me It was infuriating hearing a bunch of girls snarking on how anyone who hadn t heard of the stuff they were talking about was an idiot There was another talk less than a month later and it was similar in the fact that there was zero sympathy for men and zero mention of male victims As time wore on in college things kept getting worse with the university pushing for more female oriented talks about violence and sympathy It worsened my already bad anxiety and depression My two trips to the mental hospital didn t help either and I received little sympathy Anyways all this showed me that the modern  world did not care for the problems that men had It made me  and many on this sub feel like lesser people I do not hate women in the slightest and I don t blame them for everything wrong in my life In fact I support women s rights and wish them the best in life However I have no sympathy for misandrists and the ignorance of male suffering and demonizing of men as a whole TLDR Grew up with an abusive mother and school system that downplayed my experiences at home lead to severe depression and a rejection of modern anti male propaganda and modern feminism

MensRights,1613909846,I  m got into a debate with my friend  f who claimed there are no differences between men and women aside from physical strength and body parts My argument centered around behavioral differences and I made the point that on average men are more aggressive and interested in things and women are more agreeable and interested in people but there is more behavioral variance within each group then between This is why you see the most violent humans skew heavily male  She blamed all differences on externally driven forces like societal norms and felt male behavior is a result of how they are raised and what they are told they should be like rather than biologically driven forces  I m looking for more examples to prove my point that the majority of male female behavior is driven by biological forces One thing I remembered was car insurance is more expensive for men than women But that that could still be explained away by  external forces

MensRights,1614098969,I m sick and tired of this attitude  First marriage puts massive demands on a man  Feminism has demanded that women be released from their gender roles but men are still expected to adhere to theirs and more so than ever  You re expected to be a great provider by making lots of money  Then if you do and you get married any quick no fault divorce can swipe half of that wealth away from you plus possibly alimony and child support  For a man marriage is a great way to become financially destitute  So then if a man makes the rational decision to not participate in marriage society looks at him as some kind of creep  Who s life is it anyway  You can either get married and have those huge demands put on you and likely be destroyed financially and emotionally or you can opt out and receive a heaping helping of social stigma as unmarried men are constantly suspected of being up to no good  If you even look at someone the wrong way you re assumed to be some kind of child molester   I m so tired of all this crap I d rather live alone in a cabin in the woods and spend my days reading or canoeing on the nearby lake  Maybe I could write some stories on a manual typewriter  But being stuck in corporate America and simply expected to earn a lot and support a woman   that sucks  I m sick of it  I don t understand why any man would take the massive risk that is marriage

MensRights,1614083654,Currently I m a    year old guy and am in a much better place than I used to be when I was falsely accused of rape and sexually assaulting this girl in school and thankfully things didn t get out of hand for me during the whole situation and I got away from it relatively quickly   So this story occurred  and a half years ago when I was in school   I was always the quiet kid in school unless I was around people I was very comfortable with I was an above average but not a superb student I was in the school band and in the school table tennis team  and most of the band members were a part of the table tennis team we were almost always together and represented my school till the state level once   I was a pretty reputed student around the school and was considered as one of the nice kids who were kind always submitted homework before time worked hard in school projects and most of the teachers  who didn t teach me as well knew me pretty well   I wasn t socially great but still recognized well throughout the school   So in  th grade a week after the midterm examination we were having a PE lecture after which we had our recess I spent all of that time  one hour for PE and   minutes in recess with my friends all of us played table tennis together and then ate our lunch together  in the class our class teacher was in the class as well  right after the recess during lectures I was called by one of the peons saying that I was called by the principal   I ve never been called by the principal outside of a couple of situations where they called me and my table tennis team just to talk and congratulate us for doing well but I ve never been called alone   so I was a bit confused   while going to the principal s office the peon gave me many weird disgusted looks which I didn t know why he did so at the time   I enter the principal s office to see a girl crying with her hands over her face  I don t recognize her and the principal looking at me with a VERY angry look   I ask what s going on she tells me to shut up and said  what you did is completely disgusting you don t deserve to be on this school premises and I am considering suspending you for this which really caught me off guard cuz she s never spoken to me like that before   I ask again what happened and she tells me in a very condescending manner  oh so you don t know what you did just a few minutes ago  to which I replied that I was eating food with my friends in class   and then she asks the girl to tell everyone her story again    Back story of the girl she s a student from the other class and she s one of the entitled girls who wasn t that super popular but still had many friends she apparently had a crush on me and she asked me out a few weeks before the midterm exams to which I rejected her very respectfully telling her that I wasn t looking for any form of relationship nor am I interested in dating anyone and it was nothing against her her story mentioned that during PE class I went to the  th floor where she was and while she was going to the washroom I followed her and went into the washroom right behind her and also then manage to keep her quiet with my hands pull down my pants and rape her for   minutes and then leave her in the washroom floor and back to where ever I was   and I was devastated on listening to the story cuz I ve never even thought of doing this to ANY woman I know  or even not know and I would never wish it upon anyone ever   I immediately started stuttering and struggling to speak cuz I was still trying to interpret what she said I kept trying to say that I was with my friends the whole time struggling to say anything and mumbling most of the things almost on the verge of tears the principal then threatens to call my parents and I get very scared cuz they re very abusive to me and I don t know what they would do to me even after I was proven innocent I kept repeating that I was with my friends the whole time to which then the principal  said  okay then call your friends I want to hear from them and I ll be checking CCTV footage of where you were  my friends were called and the principal had the footage of my class the  th floor corridor and the table tennis room pulled out cuz those were the places I either was or claimed to have been there  I was in the table tennis room during PE and in my classroom during recess I was playing table tennis with my friends during the time period the girl specified and my friends also testified for the fact that I was with them the whole time and even my class teacher was called and she testified for me too   it was clearly visible that I was innocent and that I didn t do anything remotely close to what she said and then the girl says that all my friends were in on it my teacher was in on it too and started saying more and more lies and tries to maneuver her way out of the situation   my friends and I were told to leave the room and we did so too   I couldn t sleep for a couple of days after that cuz I was so scared because of the whole situation and thought that I would be treated like a rapist put in jail thrown out from my school my parents would disown me and a lot of other thoughts   a couple of weeks later after the whole situation I m told that I ve been from the table tennis team and won t be allowed to represent my school in any form of competition ever again I was also from the school band the girl was told almost nothing other than the fact that she had to go through an hour or so long lecture from the principal she still told her lies to all of her friends and many other teachers even though I had proved my innocence within mere minutes of being accused I was treated like a criminal in school my friends spoke to me less as well cuz they didn t want to be painted as a  rapist s friend  and I don t blame em for that I got bullied a whole lot more than I used to be my teachers would be more sarcastic towards me everyone gave me the looks and made the last year and a half of school a living hell for me   thankfully these topics were never brought up to my parents in any way and my teachers didn t bring it up to my parents during the parent teacher meetings though they were passive aggressive during em overall   it was a really rough time for me cuz I was treated like an outcast it made me go into depression and get into self harm telling myself that I was actually a rapist beating myself up for rejecting the girl even having suicidal thoughts and considering that life just wasn t of any use anymore everyone would treat me like this even after school was done   it made me miserable   but I m glad I hang on to dear life then   after school was over everything was a lot better for me   since the whole situation never got out of the school  cuz the school didn t share it basically shut it down to keep their own reputation high as well and since I ve gotten into college I ve gotten away from the whole story and it isn t a tag attached to me anymore   nowadays I always keep my distance from all the women I know surrounding myself with people who could testify for me staying around CCTV cameras at all times so that I can prove my location at any time   and I really suggest you all do so too   never having girls as friends ever again   I was reminded of this story today cuz of a nightmare I had with a very similar story   and just wanted to vent about it and also spread awareness that just stay away from women and surround yourself with trustable people    gt Note I won t be sharing the names of the girl principal peon teachers myself or my school in the comments or anywhere to maintain my own privacy you all are completely in your right to doubt or question this story in any way because you should never trust a random story completely and always have an ideology of innocent till proven guilty   these concepts go both ways   I m not in a court battle to give any revealing information about myself to anyone here

MensRights,1614066325,The inability to cooperate with others and consider others perspectives is key in narcissistic personality disorder very often as I hear people discussing attributes held by a man said to be narcissistic I think  that sounds fairly common among women   I have come to the conclusion that feminist talking points are specifically engineered to disguise toxic feminine narcisism as righteous indignation  As an example of what I am talking about I draw your attention to  Second to last paragraph of this post   OP said Roommate was  tearing down other women because she  at an appropriate time place and  on   asked OP to be a bit more modest when Roommate had company over the whole rhetorical method of representing such a respectful request as an attack makes it so OP can ignore how she imposes on Roommate and focus ONLY on how Roommate s polite request was an imposition on her what do you think Does feminism disguise and buttress narcissism Is it a coincidental function of dogmas created with no regard to it or am I seeing links that are not present

MensRights,1614422284,Linkedin Study    amp  x   B This LinkedIn study from     used their internal data to examine differences between men and women when job searching Among the key findings are the fact that men and women view a similar number of jobs though women apply to    fewer A recruiter is    more likely to view a man s profile which she described as result of a problematic bias that must be corrected  even though they also found that recruiters will still contact both genders at equal rates  However the author  Maria Ignatova makes no effort to hide her own bias  and sexism by writing  gt The good news is that when women do apply to a job they are    more likely than men to get hired In fact if the role is more senior than their current position that number goes up to        gt    gt While this is an uplifting stat it does show that women do a very thorough job at vetting roles  sometimes maybe too thorough If women only apply when they feel extremely qualified this could also indicate they are not pursuing stretch opportunities Linkedin is a mainstream website not a fringe feminist blog Yet blatant discrimination in hiring practices is celebrated as  good news and as  uplifting stat s   This doesn t lead to equality it s just another piece of evidence that equality isn t the actual goal Her analysis is also very weak and uses the usual strategy of reframing all issues so that women are the real victims I think a more plausible hypothesis for why men apply to    more jobs is because if we are getting rejected more often then we need to submit more applications to increase our chances of finding work Of course I would submit fewer if I was getting offers at       higher rate For most of us this is just seeing statistics that support what we already knew is happening The worst part is just being gaslit and told this is  equality and if we have a problem with it we are misogynist or examples of  toxic masculinity  I just wonder how far it will continue to go

MensRights,1614393381,After doing lots of research on the topic of circumcision and other forms of genital cutting I have identified a clear double standard that I would like to talk about and address here There are forms of FGM today that are less invasive than male circumcision such as the  ritual nick which are criminalized illegal and seen as a severe human rights violation and yet the more severe male procedure is legal and not frowned upon as such  Davis        writes      federal and state laws criminalizing genital alteration on female minors are so broad that they cover even procedures   significantly less substantial  than newborn male circumcision       a complete laissez faire attitude toward one practice coupled with total criminalization of the other runs afoul of the    free exercise   clause of the First Amendment There are also troubling implications for the constitutional requirement of   equal protection  because the laws appear to protect little girls but not little boys from religious and culturally motivated surgery   Arora et al        wrote in a paper published in  The British Journal of Medical Ethics    Male circumcision is legal in USA and tolerated in most of the world even when done by non medical practitioners in the home Yet comparable or less radical procedures in women are deemed misogynistic and human rights violations      the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics as well as WHO have labelled all forms of FGA as a human rights violation as it violates  bodily integrity in the absence of any medical benefit and victimises vulnerable girls However male circumcision is also a procedure that violates bodily integrity and up to recently was thought not to have justifiable medical benefit but was instead tolerated due to religious and cultural freedom and the lack of long term harm   Earp        also noted   There are now legally prohibited forms of medically unnecessary female genital cutting including the so called ritual nick that are   less severe  than permitted forms of medically unnecessary male and intersex genital cutting  He also writes about the differences in  khatna  which is the genital cutting procedures practiced for both sexes in Islam The male procedure is more severe and yet completely legal whereas the female procedure is criminal in all   states and treated as a  mutilation    The Bohras practice what they call  khatna  an Arabic word for circumcision  on both girls and boys within their community   In the female case  a pinch of skin is typically cut or from the clitoral hood often leaving no visible sign of alteration In the male case the entire penile foreskin is leaving an unmistakably altered sexual organ According to the ruling by Friedman discussed in the previous section the less severe female procedure is already illegal in all   states as a criminal assault It might seem then that the more severe male procedure must also be a criminal assault In fact that has been a dominant view among legal scholars who have addressed the issue since      However the male procedure continues to be treated as legal regardless of jurisdiction including in its more dangerous forms  The double standards don t stop there There is a procedure that ultra Orthodox Jews perform called  metzizah b peh which is an ancient unhygienic form of male circumcision where the  mohel  traditional circumciser tears the immature foreskin from the penile glans typically without pain control and then takes the baby s penis into his mouth to staunch the blood and supposedly  cleanse the wound This has been known to have caused many cases of herpes and led to two cases of serious brain damage and two deaths in one year alone Not only is this practice not treated as illegal it isn t even regulated City officials ultimately dropped even an informal plan to require that parents sign a consent  form   However any forms of female genital cutting including ones done in sterilized and anesthetized manners are seen as illegal and criminal   full stop   Now some might respond with something to the degree of  Circumcision has health benefits whereas FGM has none  Well the question I would ask is  If it was demonstrated that FGM had health benefits would you concede your position that it is a moral wrong  Presumably not and this is merely a moral red herring If so then you might have to be prepared to give up your view as some health benefits have also been noted for FGM in many scholarly sources For example there has been found  a lower risk of vaginal cancer  fewer infections from microbes gathering under the hood of the clitoris and protection against herpes and genital ulcers    Source      Source     Moreover at least  two studies   by Western scientists  have shown   a negative correlation between female genital cutting and HIV The authors of one of the studies both seasoned statisticians who expected to find the opposite relationship described their findings as a  significant and perplexing inverse association between reported female circumcision and HIV seropositivity  Again no one would ever consider making FGM legal on the basis of these potential prophylactic health benefits I would also like to bring to your attention something known as  cosmetic female genital cutting which typically consists of medically unnecessary procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other alterations to the female genital organs for perceived cosmesis widely practiced in Western countries and generally considered acceptable if performed with the informed consent of the individual These consist of the   same  procedures that are typically classified as FGM Given that there is overlap  or a close anatomical parallel between each form of WHO de ned  mutilation and Western style  cosmetic female genital cutting neither of which is medically necessary one must ask what the widely perceived categorical moral difference is between these two sets of procedures Controlling for clinical context varies across the two sets and is often functionally similar the most promising candidate for such a difference appears to be the   typical age   and hence   presumed    or likely consent status   of the subject But if that is correct it is not ultimately the degree of invasiveness  which ranges widely across both sets of practices  speci c tissues affected or the precise medical or non medical bene t to risk pro le of medically unnecessary  female genital cutting that is most central to determining its perceived moral acceptability Rather it is the extent to which the affected individual desires the genital cutting and can consent to it This suggests that the core of the putative rights violation is the   lack of consent  regarding a medically unnecessary intervention into one s sexual anatomy This consideration applies regardless of the sex or gender of the non consenting person Thanks for reading

MensRights,1614733524,We ve all heard the arguments saying that the feminists saying all men are rapists are only a small radicalized minority and that this group makes feminism look bad when in actuality like    of feminists on the planet or some shit are actually for equality for both men and women Next time you get into one of these arguments hit them with this    Let s say for a minute that this is indeed true that radical feminism is just a minority that speaks over the whole movement and makes actual feminists look bad Why would you rather go through the vast lengths it would take to clear feminisms reputation when you can simply just call yourselves men and women s rights activists You could spend the nanoseconds worth of time and energy to just stop associating yourself with an already widely unaccepted movement amongst men but you choose to waste months of time and energy on end trying to fix the rational repulsive attitude men have towards feminism why is that Also You know that men as a whole at this point are on edge most of us have severe issues due to the inherently destructive behaviors that we were  and still are slammed with via social conditioning from a very young age  You know that men s issues are being either created or sent to the next extreme every day by feminists across the globe You know this point men as a whole are so unprotected and left so vulnerable in our society that a group of women with a decent level of social political standing could come up one day and say    of all men need to be castrated at birth for the safety of women and the only reason that wouldn t happen is cause men make up like    of world governments and military You know the reason men react in such a negative way towards feminism is cause we fear for our lives which feminism is putting at risk more and more each day with its words and actions You know men are hurt and are acting like women do when their rights and lives are being threatened And most importantly you know feminism is the biggest threat to men today and you know you could do something to help men Yet you choose to support and even defend feminism then choose to tell us men that we re wrong for reacting to attacks on their well being we re wrong for despising feminism we re wrong for going  oh boy whenever someone says they re a feminist etc Sorry if this sounds a little harsh but saying you support my rights yet you claim you stand with and support the people who took them away from me doesn t make you sound credible or trustworthy in any capacity if you truly were for men s rights you d acknowledge that feminism is the last thing men will stand with or for and stop associating yourself with a clearly sexist and deceptive movement  
MensRights,1614703389,  that is the link to the evidence that askfeminists is sexist
MensRights,1614700612,In the     s feminists attempted to create a false etymology for the phrase   rule of thumb    It was claimed that husbands used to be able to beat their wives so long as they used a stick or a whip no thicker than their thumb This is of course not true and the real etymology for the phrase comes from a practice of using the length or width of your thumb as a unit of measure You d be surprised just how many people believe this to be true though  The idea that men could legally beat their wives is a cornerstone of feminist dogma that they ve tried to push for decades  The evidence for this practice however is basically non existent  There are a couple court cases from the     s where men have seemingly gotten away with hitting their wives but it has never actually been a legal practice under US law or under English common law And even those court cases that some feminists try to cite seem fairly lackluster In one such case the husband was found innocent due to a lack of bruising or marks on his wife  Which feminists try to interpret as  it was fine so long as you didn t beat your wife too severely   Even if such a husband did get away with hitting his wife clearly it was still a crime since it was prosecuted And the reason he was found innocent came down to a lack of evidence not because there was a misogynistic loophole that he took advance of   Other court cases ruled on interpretations of English common law which is taken to help legitimize the idea that some form of wife abuse used to be legal However those court rulings consistently found insufficient evidence to justify an exception including for cases of  mild discipline of your wife   Which if anything seems like evidence against this not in favor of it Domestic violence wasn t explicitly outlawed in the US at a federal level until the early     s which is another talking point you see about this But it was still illegal at the state level going back to the     s And would have also been illegal under regular assault laws This is because there weren t any legal exceptions granted to husbands to assault their wives the way feminists like to say there were Even more damning is that wife abuse  but not husband abuse carried with it very cruel and unusual punishments throughout most of history  Under one law a husband accused of beating his wife would be buried with just his head left above the ground so that his wife could do whatever she wanted to him in retribution In fact it was actually husband abuse not wife abuse that used to be legal in history  Under some laws a wife was not only allowed to beat her husband but if she did it was used as evidence that the husband had actually done something wrong and needed to be punished  even more   The assumption is that he had to have done something to piss her off bad enough to hit him  And him making her mad but not her hitting him out of anger was deemed to be a crime  Under some versions of this law the punishment for making your wife angry enough to hit you included being drug throughout town by horses The expectation both socially and legally was that husbands were supposed to be subservient to their wives not the other way around So not only is this feminist view lacking in evidence but the very opposite of it seems to have been true   Here is a source I ve been using for this for a while       The  Great Taboo and the Role of Patriarchy in Husband and Wife Abuse   Full text   Not only does it go into the background of this controversy the authors analyzed a bunch of papers that claim that wife abuse used to be legal to show that their citation trails basically go nowhere  The only legitimate primary source is something written in the     s by Sir William Blackstone an English judge He claimed that someone told him that you could use moderate discipline on your wife at some distant point in the past but even he couldn t find a reference to it in older law books He then went on to say that such a thing would be obviously illegal in modern times  meaning in     s England   Thus apparently refuting the claim in the very source that is commonly cited as evidence for it  Modern historians have of course found no evidence for this either Like a lot of things you come across in the context of gender and gender equality I was expecting this to be fairly unknown outside of the men s community  Obviously there are academic references but just because you have sources doesn t mean it s widely known about On a whim I decided to check out Wikipedia just to see how this was handled there  And I was surprised to find that not only was this mentioned as a myth but the article itself went into a good bit of detail over the history of this revisionist claim   Clearly there s been a bit of  debate that s played out on this page given the length of discussion that s afforded to this just in the intro section  where it goes back and forth with a few feminist talking points sprinkled in here or there  But ultimately the facts have prevailed What I found interesting is just how much time energy and money feminists have put into making this seem like a legitimate fact  To quote Wikipedia  gt In the   th century public concern with the problem of domestic violence declined at first and then re emerged along with the resurgent feminist movement in the     s    The first recorded link between wife beating and the phrase  rule of thumb appeared in      in a report on domestic violence by women s rights advocate Del Martin  gt  gt For instance the common law doctrine had been modified to allow the husband  the right to whip his wife provided that he used a switch no bigger than his thumb  a rule of thumb so to speak     gt While Martin appears to have meant the phrase  rule of thumb only as a figure of speech some feminist writers treated it as a literal reference to an earlier law        The following year a book on battered women stated  gt  gt One of the reasons nineteenth century British wives were dealt with so harshly by their husbands and by their legal system was the  rule of thumb  Included in the British Common Law was a section regulating wifebeating      The new law stipulated that the reasonable instrument be only  a rod not thicker than his thumb  In other words wifebeating was legal      gt Despite this erroneous reading of the common law  which is a set of judicial principles rather than a written law with individual sections the spurious legal doctrine of the  rule of thumb was soon mentioned in a number of law journals       The myth was repeated in a     report by the United States Commission on Civil Rights on domestic abuse titled  Under the Rule of Thumb  as well as a later United States Senate report on the Violence Against Women Act     gt In the late   th century some efforts were made to discourage the phrase  rule of thumb     which was seen as taboo owing to this false origin    Patricia T O Conner former editor of the  New York Times Book Review described it as  one of the most persistent myths of political correctness     During the     s several authors wrote about the false etymology of  rule of thumb  including the conservative social critic Christina Hoff Sommers    who described its origin in a misunderstanding of Blackstone s commentary     Nonetheless the myth persisted in some legal sources into the early     s    There are other myths floating around out there as well  For example it is often said that you could beat your wife on certain days of the week or in certain locations  commonly the courthouse steps on Sunday  Despite being widely repeated and endorsed by feminists as near as I can tell that one is a myth also   So why make these efforts to rewrite history And what does it say about your ideology that you have to make things up to help legitimatize it This isn t the only area that feminists have engaged in historical revisionism  Other examples include the nature of coverture under English common law  a type of marriage  the treatment of women as literal slaves to men and of course the history of the movement itself   First wave feminism and  second wave feminism weren t actually older incarcerations of feminism Most of those people didn t call themselves feminists and they definitely wouldn t have agreed with modern feminist ideology However a great deal of time and effort has been made to appropriate their accomplishments under the banner of feminism The good news is that a lot more attention has been given to this recently  Sources are easier to come by and there have even been a couple books written by impartial historians about this  including at least one book  The Privileged Sex  where the author went in to it under the assumption that women were oppressed and was surprised to find just how incorrect of a view that is  Facts can t be hidden forever  You can try to rewrite history all you want but people are going to find the truth when they actually go looking for it 
MensRights,1614488775,A few months ago we were gathered in a flat chilling A few men and women People started drinking and having fun dancing   Not one person in the room was drunk by definition cause most had to work the next day  I recall the story better than anyone because I was the only one who didn t drink because I simply don t drink and I could see whether someone was getting out of hand Wasn t the case from start to finish The  started making out aggressively and full of passion just in front of me and they went to the  st room on the left Every room was connected to the living room so you could hear what was happening in any room even if you didn t want to They just started having sex and were loud doing their thing both dirty talking I can t tell you exactly what they said cause I wasn t paying attention but that tone of voice was dirty talking undoubtedly Fast forward a couple of days ago I heard that there s a rumour going around town  I don t live in that town but I used to so I spend time there regarding that night  their hookup  Her friends apparently asked her whether it was true that she hooked up with him and she allegedly said that she was too drunk and remembers having sex but not even with who Which is absolute bs The friends told her that that s assault and are persuading her to take action without even trying to ask her anything related Both were in immaculate condition my friend isn t what you would deem as popular and apparently only I and another girl knew they hooked up She s  refusing to take legal action but they keep persuading her I m     sure that her intention wasn t to get to this point but more like to give an excuse as to why she fucked the nerdy guy no one fucks it backfired and now she probably doesn t know how to manage the situation or is willing to admit it I spoke to her very politely and told her that I was there sober and she didn t seem to be drunk whatsoever and nobody did drugs She said that she doesn t want to go forward with the law but she was drunk I didn t argue cause what s the point I know that she knows the law isn t something to make a joke about and that the truth will get out there and will destroy her and her reputation like it is doing to my friend right now The guy is scared shitless because even though he knows myself and the other girl would come forward if necessary anything can happen if they end up persuading her The town is divided Most women haven t even questioned him and are assuming he assaulted her and the other half of people trust the facts that I gave them To me this isn t a matter of friendship If I heard anything odd whatsoever I would have undoubtedly walked in the room and see what s going on Wasn t the case and now the guy can t even sleep just from thinking about it What would you guys suggest

MensRights,1614852498,  This is a long post and I didn t add tl dr because I need to explain everything briefly I am sorry for no tl dr but discussing these issues are very important to understand and help men s mental issues   We all know that a man s status can differ They can be working class they can be white collar working class they can be rich or they can be middle class Yet the society not only compare men within their socio economic class but also compare men within different classes a  cross class comparement At the end the measurement will be done by looking at two things How much the men earns and how many partners they get You can achieve something great scientifically you will be headlines for once Eventually if you can t turn it into huge money or investment you will be forgotten  This is not only done by men but women also values men based on these things After all we are a society and every gender is part of the society they live in   This is a huge problem Men who can barely sustain their life plus not getting laid are suicidal Yes They feel weak worthless and complete failures Men who can sustain their life can cope a little while men who can sustain their life and get married without divorce can also cope enough Marriage is somehow viewed as a  success by society even by most progressive ones Somehow marrying resets your past mistakes and you are baptised by marriage The man gets a life long partner so he must be succesful that s one of the highest levels of success for working class men If they can manage to avoid huge debts may be buying a house with debt or mortgage get their children in school and get them jobs and marriages they will reach their peak level of success  Now of course if their children can get into middle class that will be beyond their realistic goals Anyways My point is to feel successful secure worthful and complete a men has sets of tasks given to them by society To be worthy you need to complete them Each men according to their socio economic class has different sets of tasks And all link to earning money and getting laid We all know incels or heard about them If we break down their psychology or  lonely man psychology in general we can find that most lonely man even if they are surrounded by people can t feel  complete  They lack the satisfaction We humans have an evolutionary response for loneliness or not accepted by society depression This feeling is a defence mechanism of body to stop doing acts that secludes them from society Still if you are successful at work and have a social life but can t get satisfacted for varying reasons you will feel lonely And this loneliness eventually lead to depression Yes Getting laid won t make you more men and not getting laid won t make you a lesser men I did have many partners and girlfriends but it shouldn t be the main focus of our lives I see many young men feel bad for not being able to get a girlfriend That shouldn t bother you but the system and society wants you to feel bad It is designed in that way and our one of the first struggle shall be against these norms Men shouldn t be valued by how much they earn and how many partners they can find Also we all know what this means To get more money you either need to be rich because money attracts money or you need to get in a good earning job Otherwise like if you are the clerk at McDonalds cashier you are doomed And to get partners our today s society is very  lookist  I see many men being rejected because of them being at medium or short height or not being very well looking Money can cover up all of them but if you don t have money then your look really matters The system doesn t only forces men They also make women think they are worthless unless they get the best partner for themselves Like I said before the society is not made up by a single gender and both gender are victims of this system and society This is why we all dream about a united struggle a solidarity where men and women fight for their worth and rights against the system  Now let s talk about reasons of these problems in a very summarized way   Reasons    To breakdown these reasons societal norms are not enough to explain everything The capitalistic world where there is an illusion of choice freedom and  competition  makes everything worse There is no denying that capitalism uses every method to ensure it s own safety profit and presence and has no shame into destroying lives souls and environment in the process There is no freedom of choice but we are raised to believe that we have Getting different unhealthy snacks from supermarkets is not freedom of choice We don t have freedom after all we can t get in the hermit life just like that Ensuring survival and living in harmony with nature is near impossible in today s world The most brutal truth about it was colonisation of Africa You can never be left alone in any corner of the world And finally the illusion of  competition        There is no competition We  compete with each other to be best servants of their system They don t want you to start up your own small business and live peacefully They want everything to serve in their economic mechanism that allows them to earn most and be the dominant class If you can get into their chamber you are welcome Otherwise we are all equally piece of shits and will be treated in that way We will compete with each other harm each other block each other or even plot against each other So only the ones who can serve better will rank up And most of us I mean almost none of us will be CEO of McDonalds who earns millions of dollars per year   And men are also got into the plastic surgery trap This is a market and it targeted women first They made women feel inferior and worthless when they weren t just like celebrities they presented Celebrities are one of the aristocratic establishments of capitalism Their main task is to set up the standards for society and make it look like those standards are mere average Being       It s just average They don t even get any plastic surgery    they just drink lots of water Yes they targeted women first like I said Women who felt worthless because they couldn t meet these standards of course tried plastic surgery so they could feel better It s not their fault and we should be fair about it because sometimes I see people blaming women for these stuffs It s not their fault  Now men are being targeted by this beauty market Buy products to look handsome Get your nose and chin done Get some more jawline Because outlook and money are all that matters Nothing else has any meaning in todays society and we are both slaves and consumerists of the system Thanks for reading I hope we can help our fellow brothers with their mental issues We should encourage them We should tell them that not getting laid or not earning much is totally ok They need to find things that they love in this world and get on the track Don t let the system and society ruin everything It is a fight against the world designed to make us suffer and we are all veterans of this war

MensRights,1614825132,E Oops Male sexuality that is attracted to women in some form that is   Disclaimer   I didn t feel like making a million fucking  sarcasm quotation marks apply them as necessary while reading lol This is hypocrisy in the purest form they use old anti porn feminist arguments and logic when dealing with issues that relate to female sexualization through the male gaze and call it objectifying and dehumanizing and yet they switch over to sex positive arguments and logic when it comes to their own sexualization and self objectification insisting that it is healthy or even empowering when a woman chooses to do it regardless of the circumstances or context The issue is that those anti porn arguments are fundamentally sexist and sex negative against women they imply that women are inherently demeaned by their own sexuality relative to a male s Yet this sexist logic that concludes women are sexually inferior to men is allowed to be weaponized against us and to shame our own natural biology without implying anything negative towards women They will assert that they are being sexualized in ways that are inherently sexist that sexuality itself isn t the problem it is because we view them as sexual objects but this is nothing but bullshit assumptions A woman being objectified is seen as more harmful than a man because of the implied sexual shame for women Women were primarily valued for their looks femininity and domestic role long before the sexual revolution ever took place Now just to clarify I want to express that my issue is that they simply twist their ideology to benefit themselves at every turn I am against the ludicrous double standard that this represents I am not in favor of shaming men or women for sex just because we have different biology I want to create a more sex positive and equal society apparently much more so than feminists do Feminists want to hide behind their victim status when it is convenient and put unnecessary suffering onto men in the process I can t express how fucking insane it is that their whole theory of objectification is widely accepted despite being a mess of contradictions

MensRights,1614789596,while I dont think this is an injustice or unfair it is important to men s rights and feelings  amp  x   B when boys go into puberty and start looking for more mature content they will pop into those YouTubers who do low effort Reddit videos and reaction videos but they will show off cleavage this in itself is not an issue and younger boys seeing this is also not a big deal but I feel they should understand what is happening you know that they are feeling arousal or attraction to said YouTubers but they don t know that and whether this is predatory and manipulative is another topic altogether you see I fell into this trap of not understanding why I watched these YouTubers because at the time I was watching another more interesting and understandable Reddit YouTuber who made real content I did not understand the feelings I felt towards these YouTubers and I think that that isn t good I also see my younger brother finding these YouTubers and I think that boys should have the information to understand what is happening also some personal things are happening with my brother that are very personal and I will not share even though you guys have had the same thing also mods if you don t like can you direct me to a place where the mods will like this post   amp  x   B TLDR younger boys entering puberty are attracted to female YouTubers who show off their bodies  and that s fine of course but they don t understand and they also go through personal changes they won t understand until captain hindsight tells them I feel that boys should understand these changes

MensRights,1615232980,So basically I was a temp at this job and there was a woman there who seemed a little interested in me as something more than a friend I do have above average looks so I m not too unfamiliar with this happening to me But I had a girlfriend and this woman coworker of mine was   years older than me at the time and divorced Anyways I got to know her over the weeks and one day she invited me to her house for dinner I accepted because she had been very nice to me and I know she s a good cook When I got there she gave me a glass of wine which was laced with some kind of roofie that made me become something of a vegetable but still conscious After about half an hour the roofie kicked in and she started with the raping When she was done she also took what I can only assume was another roofie because she laid down on the floor and soon she was in the same state that I was A couple hours later I started being able to move fully again and I left while she was sleeping probably high as fuck  I decided not to be a pussy about that and on Monday I talked to my female boss who just sat there and smiled and sometimes giving me the  are you stupid enough to think I ll believe that  look while I told her this story I wasn t too emotionally scarred by the incident itself honestly my biggest concern was that my girlfriend might find out and dump me But after I had told my story I could tell my boss was about to start laughing but she said she would talk with my rapist about this Her office had glass walls and I was looking into that room and could see my rapist crying I though that she had been fired and that was the end of that But no I get called back into my boss s office and she locked the door when I got in Then she told me that she had called the police and that I were to wait in her office until they arrived to take me away for rape  Fast forward a bit and I m in jail and no one believed my story Not the interrogation officer not the arresting officer and not even my family and friends The only one that believed me was my girlfriend and her parents Luckily they were rich and could afford a good lawyer  I also had the luck to get a fair judge and jury who eventually gave me a non guilty verdict Now what did the rapist get who drugged me with an illegal substance before raping me A promotion and a TV interview about speaking up against rape What did I get Kicked out of my apartment fired from my job and probably have little to no hope to get a good job in the future Life of  a man everybody Never the victim   
MensRights,1615232499,In honor of international women s day I would like to post some of my conclusions following several years of research on feminism men s rights and the gender war   What group is primarily hurt by the division of men and women resulting in the fragmentation of the family It is the lower classes who depend upon the cooperation of individuals who are primarily hurt by any loss of social cohesion The more money a person has at their disposal the more insulated that individual is from the effects of social deterioration They can simply purchase what they need and throw money at any problems that come their way The less money you have the more you need the cooperation of others for survival even more so to thrive  The upper classes have a long history of using social issues to fragment the lower classes one prominent example is the widespread use of race baiting on syndicated news programs who despite any claims to the contrary serve as nothing more than mouthpieces of the ruling economic elites Multinational corporate support of feminism serves this function and any divide in the family hits at the heart of the functionality of the working class as anything more than simple wage slaves a condition that corporate interests require to maintain a philosophy of endless growth   What group benefits primarily from the division of men and women resulting in the fragmentation of the family Since the rise of feminism the average wage of the working class adjusted for inflation has stagnated  if not dropped  At the same time the productivity of multinational corporations has steadily increased to the point that certain individuals in the economic elite have as much money if not more than the federal government At the same time social programs that benefit the working class have been systematically cut things like school funding welfare programs social security and unemployment insurance  all providing valuable safety nets and resources  in order to fund systematic cuts to the taxes paid by these individuals and institutions So long as they are divided against each other along the lines of race and gender the lower classes cannot mount an effective defense against the squeeze With this ungodly wealth the elites now have at their disposal it is an easy thing to buy off the government to turn a blind eye to their enslaving usurious practices From the legalization of corruption through citizen s united to the outright theft of elections the government is now their strong arm  From this we can clearly see what feminism is an ideology co opted by multinational corporations and the economic elite to hobble the working class and strong arm them into perpetual wage slavery in order to maintain a philosophy of unlimited growth So MRA s Don t expect the government to support you Don t expect wealthy corporations to support you When you fight for men s rights you are not just fighting for men s rights but also against their will to power Expect  resistance Expect to be vilified You are what they fear most men standing in unity

MensRights,1615231190,Hello I recently posted here that I  a   year old teenager support the Mens Rights Movement I want to be more active on this subreddit and voice my opinion as the communuty here seems welcoming and isn t mad at all I support gender equality for both men and women and it s wrong that women  and men too but women do it more statisticly speaking are treated better and get away with more stuff than men Anyways my post Correct me if I m wrong but in order for a female to  produce  a man would need to fertilize the egg Without men it would be impossible to fertilize the egg and both women and men would both go extinct So why do some women hate men when we are part of the reason they exist

MensRights,1614896742,I m new to this sub but after being severely abused by two romantic partners in my life I ve become much more personally involved with men s rights I might get into it in future posts but here s my current concern     Just now on facebook I saw a post telling us to teach men to not normalize touching women s waists as you pass them by I ve never personally done this or felt a need and of course touching someone like that shouldn t be accepted but I ve become admittedly jaded Yes I agree it shouldn t be done but the wording of the post came off as bigoted and demonizing to men I immediately thought what about all the women I ve known that say  excuse me once and then proceed to push the man out of the way before he even has time to react It s not just they they push past them they do it aggressively What I observe is that the specific women who do this enter the situation expecting to be disrespected The last time I saw this was at a bar and a man was standing talking to a group of friends The woman said excuse me and he obviously didn t hear her simple as that She perceived it as him purposefully ignoring disrespecting her and proceeded to elbow him out of the way No one said anything no one did anything They allowed it to happen and let her get away with it without consequence To me this normalizes it because the woman who got away with it leaves the situation feeling as if she s in the right because no one told her it was wrong    It s funny to me because society views men as the aggressors but in my experience most of the aggression and hostility I ve experienced has come from women Now obviously I m not saying this to diminish violence women have experienced I m simply describing something men experience and nothing more In hindsight I see men being physically pushed around a lot concerts bars and subways to name a few It s not necessarily an every day occurrence but it happens enough that I notice it and no one seems to care enough to speak out about it  Has anyone else noticed this trend I know for a fact I wouldn t appreciate being elbowed and I sure as hell am not out to disrespect anyone If I don t move it s because I didn t hear you 
MensRights,1614890763,So me and my friend had a discussion today  We focused on US and excluded third world countries as women have it worse there It was about the topic if there should also be a month dedicated to men I was on the side that there should be to not create a toxic gap between both of the genders to bring awareness to mens problems as well Whether it would be sort of awareness month or just mens history month or something of this sort My friend however said that men don t deserve this kind of a thing As they didn t suffer enough compared to women My points were divorce cases men being forced to go to war false abuse or rape accusations suicide rates or just how media don t cover as much of the problems that men face as women do Over time it went from talking about if there should be a month like that to an argument of whether men s issues are equal to female issues It got to the point where there were  sides Mine Both genders issues should be treated equally and we should aspire to solve both of them My friends We should prioritise women issues over mens I said that we should be prioritising both genders problems as postponing the other genders problems would only make society root from the inside But I guess having this opinion makes me an incel Guess we should only focus on female problems and ignore the struggles that males have to face in the current day   Take into consideration it could be biased from my side as we both got frustrated at each other that argument   So what do you think  Edit I just wanted to say this because its been stressing me today Im allowed to study online or in person I study online and my friend studies in person We had the discussion on a discord call I just don t want rumours of me being an incel spreading and me not being able to do anything

MensRights,1615378119,Just like sperm banks changed culture and power dynamics in society so will artificial incubation when it becomes commercially available   It will give men the ability to reproduce without women and will free women up to work more and be more productive for society without wasting time with  months of pregnancy or raising kids   The result In all honesty it will be negative for both men and women but especially women we all know how utilitarian policy makers and corporate leaders can be out there   but it will be especially affect women negatively in a way that will make the middle ages look progressive   I don t think either side realizes this   but establishing true unity and true equality and equal treatment is more important now than ever   for women s sakes as much as men I feel this is going right over many people s heads on reddit and in contemporary discourse 
MensRights,1615377013,Hey lads first time caller long time listener here  As the title says I fell down a reddit rabbit hole found  r superstraight and I m interested to hear if anyone s been watching this and what thoughts they had if any I followed it for a couple of days and  whew I m happy to be off the wild ride now I think the sub has been shut down as of a few hours ago  I was just about done anyway  but must admit it was a guilty pleasure to follow and there was just  something intriguing about watching the sub devolve in a matter of days  hours  as far as I can tell For anyone out of the loop I  believe  and stand to be corrected on any of this the whole  movement is less than  weeks old It apparently was started by a Tiktok user by the name of Kyle Royce who posted about being guilted and called out by others over being attracted exclusively to women who were born female and I believe he coined the term  superstraight at that point This meant acknowledging that trans women are indeed women and that if you re a straight man you re attracted to them just as much as any other type of women by default hence the need for this new term to specify that as a heterosexual man you re only attracted to biological women and this makes you  superstraight as it were This ended up catching the guy a lot of flak and he was called out as transphobic etc  This is where I m a bit hazy on the details  I really thought the subreddit was formed as a tongue in cheek response to the  ber woke reaction calling this guy out but in essence wasn t to be taken overly seriously  they were using the abbreviation  SS for God s sake of course I thought it was a joke I saw posts calling out  superphobes and calling for superstraights to band together and unite for a greater good  it was a parody a la the Super Best Friends in South Park  there was no way this was     for real I saw it as shining a light on the ridiculousness of the extent woke culture has gone to and holding up a mirror to their cause with a  cause of their own I was into it because I genuinely don t think anyone should be given shit over who they are and aren t attracted to or who they should be  allowed be attracted to and thought the ironic shitposts and memery was an  up yours to anyone trying to guilt straight dudes telling them what to do  but also just saw it as a good time as I procrastinate on reddit  Soon it wasn t just straight dudes anymore there were superstraight girls posting  transitioning pics going from non pregnant to pregnant people posting aryan looking  super families then supergays superbis even supertrans  trans who were only attracted to trans but hey the more the merrier we re just having a good time here Lots and lots of superlesbians posting I was still assuming at this point that there was a comedic air to all of this People would post and ask if the sub was for real and of course people would respond that it was a legitimate sub keeping in line with what I thought was the spirit of the sub I even responded to one myself to assure someone that  we were legit Another time I suggested we have our own flag emojis  I said it thinking it would add an obnoxious authenticity to the movement but I think people thought it was unironically a good idea and it got something like    upvotes lol  Extremely quickly the mood on the sub changed terms like TERFs were being thrown around  Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists posts were made about trans women raping biological lesbian women by coercing them into sex under the guise of being a fellow biological woman Charity posts for women s shelters that banned trans women were posted and stickied Someone commented with a link to a men s shelter that reached the top of the post and the OP responded that their focus would be on the women s shelter for now and that they wanted to concentrate on one at a time to give people a break in between asking for donations I didn t know that the sub had become a channel for fundraising or who the OP was as an authority to tell anyone who their money should go to while disregarding the other charity but the priority was stated clearly  I m not the sharpest tool in the shed but the penny had dropped at this stage that this was something else now it looked like a hostile takeover from the remnants of the  lgb drop the t crowd trying to make their reddit comeback A quick Google and I saw a post on Ovarit from feminists who were rallied behind the superstraight cause for their own reasons but were giving a stark reminder to their own that straight dudes were appalling in general and that any allied common interest was an unfortunate coincidence They were not to join in with the memes and humour because the straight dudes didn t care enough about women s rights or radical feminism and that women could not be funny in their eyes anyway  Tl Dr  Piss takey subreddit suggesting straight guys should be allowed choose who they wanna be with in the form of memes and shitposts becomes subject of hostile takeover by radical feminists within days who enforce their own agenda astonishingly quickly and lead to the sub having a transition

MensRights,1615375211,This is more of a mental health post than anything else I ve noticed that a few of the men on here get obsessed with the level of hate and inequality that gets levelled towards men and that s fair but you gotta stay away from toxic communities like the feminism ones on here and in other places In exposing yourself to all that hate every day you will be impacted by it Men please take care of yourselves Have open and honest discussion here and in other spaces that are actually interested in equality but when you go to those other forums that are only interested in female supremacy you will be shat upon from dizzying heights and I can only assume that s what you might be looking for because at this point you shouldn t be expecting that conversation to go differently You re actively seeking out people who hate you stop it just live a good life do good work and take care of your communities Toxic ideologies like feminism always die it might be popular today but a lot of hateful things used to be popular all you have to do is keep speaking up for yourself in your every day life Think of it this way a black person making an impassioned speech about racial equality at a KKK rally is stupid because no one there is interested in their views and in fact actively hates them for being black so making impassioned equality speeches and paragraphs in feminism groups is stupid because they do not care about men s rights and in fact actively hate you for being a man who loves himself Stop feeding yourselves to these wolves it s having a detrimental effect on your mental health Please take care of yourselves

MensRights,1615355820,Sorry for the format and also if is not allowed or correct but I need to share this This time surrounding the march  th protests in my country put me in a critical point  I fully support the critique against the Mexican government for the lack of actions towards violence and their misogynistic behaviour Nevertheless seeing all the hate speech shared in the social media towards men by the common folk by women that at one moment I considered friends or colleagues   All the media coverage for the protests also seeing my male friends arguing with my female friends about which gender is more  victimised and how the feminist are too violent or too extremist made me realize that the problem is not the injustice or violence from one gender to another   What I realised is that all the modern society is showing the true idea women s life is instrinsecally worthy Therefore all their problems are important worthy of attention and action to be taken  The underlying message also is Men s life is worthless men are expendable therefore their problems can be ignored as there are and there will be more men to fill the gap And that s what hurt me the most If we raise the banners to protest for men s rights that our life is worthy we will find ridicule jokes and be minimised That we should man up that is not a big deal We are treated as mere numbers in the statistics And that will be my stand point from now on Not fighting the feminist not contradicting but raising awareness on the men Issues as the feminist did But not asking for special treatment only what is fair 
MensRights,1615352589,  Note Read the whole post before you comment and dont just skim read it or you will probably miss some big and important things I have said   There are a lot of people out there especially online that say that white men rule the world and receive extra privileges because of it but I very rarely see this I have never been treated any different because Im a white dude Not in school not in public not by family or friends And I have never seen any different treatment of white males compared to other people that was helping the white men I am even to go out and say sometimes it feels like I get treated worse because I am a white male For example this post    and most of that sub If I said something like that about women unless I said it to the far right I would become twitters new poster boy to hate receive a lot of brutal comments and probably receive a death threat But she  presumably and i feel its a safe guess can make fun of a issue that a lot of men face that affects their mental and physical health with encouragement Now does the porn industry dehumanize women Yes I agree with that but it also sets unrealistic expectations for men too and I sure as hell have never seen anyone say that Theres also this post   which isnt upsetting but the comments are brutal Theres one comment that really pisses me off too because its full of lies  Because men only ever pretend to care about men s issues when they re trying to shut down conversations about women s issues  No Just no Remember when the boyscouts were shut down over the sexual abuse of boys I dont know about all men but a lot of the ones I knew were happy that something like that was being put to an end Then theres the thing that every day is mens day Im genuinely concerned here I guarantee you     the only men who agree with this are so far to the political right there wives arent allowed to speak unless spoken too and they arent the proudest examples of a man The last thing is mens mental health When women post something about depression or anxiety they are called strong and heroic  that isnt a bad thing its a fucking amazing thing but when I do it somewhere that isnt centered around mental health I see a dramatically less happy comments Ive been called weak and it hurts Im expected to be strong and emotionless in public because I am a man  The mens suicide rate is nearly  x times higher and the homeless mens population is double So I sit in bed tonight wondering is there actually any privilege for men because it doesnt seem like it Am I overlooking somethings Maybe being a little dramatic What do you think reddit   Important Note I am not trying to downplay womens or minorities issues I see that they too face hurdles in life but in my opinion  white men are facing large hurdles and  hate I do not encourage hating on anyone including the comments or the people in the post mentioned above Do not do that it is a really bad thing to do     I will try and link the post down below in the comments

MensRights,1615333636,So I just found this sub and without thinking much I hit the follow button   After looking thru some comments I ve noticed a lot of people absolutely shitting on feminists I can understand that I am guilty of that on occasion especially the extreme ones I just want you all to know that there are women out there like myself that actually have good intentions and truly just want equal rights not special treatment I do identify as a feminist for lack of a better word but I normally just show it thru actions rather than saying that out loud I may be the exception to the rule but we do exist Not quite sure if this is just a place that angry men come to bitch about women or if you all truly have good intentions as well but I find it interesting that you have such a large community here in this sub and I think it says a lot about our society and how men really feel oppressed in certain ways  Anywho if y all ever want an objective female perspective I can provide that otherwise I ll just lurk 
MensRights,1615329476,So my sisters are your classic university  liberal SJW s and whenever i m with them they will constantly be saying things like  Why are all men like that  Or  I hate men   One of my recent favourites is when one of them and I were arguing about this and she was like  You have no idea what it s like to be a woman but yet she thought it was completely fine for her to prejudge what it s like to be a man Another classic from the other one is the  Well we don t need men  She ll go on about how women could essentially just kill off all men and just use sperm to artificially impregnate people but when I hit back with well men could do that as well with eggs she was like no My main point of this is that it s really starting to annoy me and it is really isn t helpful during everything that s happened recently for myself to be constantly bombarded with  Men bad and  Kill all men  Any way I just wanted to get that off my chest for once 
MensRights,1615324241,Everyday I come on here and see more and more posts about how feminism is hurting our cause or how some dude has been charged with rape or some dude has been killed today It s honestly quite depressing to see all this This sub is now becoming more negative than positive and we are just proving our hater s assumptions about us correct with how we behave This place has become less about men s rights and combating the misandry we see on a day to day basis and more for complaining about life s frustrations We claim to have absolutely no tolerance for misogynists but there are several MGTOWs who haven t been downvoted to all hell yet Sooner or later we won t be any better than r MGTOW   amp  x   B For example take a quick look at the sidebar We have for more negative flairs than we do positive flairs A lot of them haven t even been used enough to appear on the sidebar Almost every post here are flared as either   Social Issues   Discrimination   Feminism   General Sometimes you may see a post flared as  Progress or  Humour  but those make up the vast majority Why do we call ourselves a movement if we aren t doing anything big to benefit our cause People have already disproven the wage gap feminism and even the patriarchy So if these are the major things standing in our way why do we not at least try to change it We have an already solid list of problems men face on a daily basis pinned to the sidebar as well as an even broader list in our back pockets Why do we continue talking about how hard life is when we aren t even taking the steps necessary to improve it And I know that men can t win in today s world and we d get hate from incels screaming about how misogynistic we are for being fed up of the bs we face on a daily But if we band together and protest a lot we could make this work Take the Women s Rights Movement as an example Remember all the boomers shooting them down when they started out Well they persevered and managed to succeed at their goals If they could do it so can we Maybe then we ll have less  Discrimination in our feeds and more  Activism Support and  Progress  amp  x   B So who s with me Let s get off our butts and start gaining those rights

MensRights,1615506062, Remember Freedom is the right of all sentient beings More importantly it is a privilege Many have honored it and do honor it today Some have greatly abused it Few denied it to others for various iniquitous reasons such as prejudice Whether freedom is a right or privilege no one has the right to take it away from others    Optimus Prime from Transformers  amp  x   B I m pretty sure we can all agree that that there are a lot of problems men face that women often don t have to because of gender I E Men commit suicide more often the majority of homeless people are male and so on But one thing we as men might come to think is that women are born with more entitlement than men and men have often used that to say that all women are bad But that s just simply not true Now before you tell me things like  Oh You re one of the lucky ones  or  Oh You re probably not even a real male for saying stuff like this  let me tell you a little story about myself I remember growing up in a small town in Montana and would go out of town almost every Wednesday night to go to a Christian youth group However this circle of cliquey popular girls would often tease and prank me but not on the biases of gender Instead they were teasing me because of my mental disability  being Autism  But as much as I know many females that have been like this  and even worse in some cases  I also know many females that aren t even a little like them Such as my principle who has given me many amazing opportunities to improve myself and where I am and my mom who has also done just as much as my dad to provide for me  not dissing my pops Love you dad  Also let us not forget that there are so many women out there who while speaking for women s rights have also advocated for ours like Helly Shah or Allie Stucky These brave women and more have advocated for us and risked being labeled as bigots and traitors for it At the end of the day I know there are a lot of men who have had a lot of bad experiences with women and have used those experiences to hold a grudge against all women but in my experience that s because they haven t met any women that are better Trust me there are better women out there people I think my point is we should judge people based on character and not their gender  amp  x   B  This is one of the reasons why beings like us exist We may be aliens to this planet but we still have a responsibility We have to save them from our war Even though we are strangers sometimes a stranger can be a great teacher Even a savior And perhaps soon It will be up to us to remind them of where they stand So then they have more knowledge on how to make progress as a civilization so they can finally be one with each other Like how we once were Before the Decepticons When we were peaceful and just And I promise you We will be again peaceful and just    Optimus Prime from Transformers

MensRights,1615498701,I really love my mum And normally we are able to talk about controversial issues quite well But recently I tried to have a conversation with my mum about the men in the criminal justice system I complained at a quote that said that men got away with crimes saying that was completely untrue and its a disgusting thing to say Men face significant discrimination in the criminal justice system But the problem is that my mum was a victim of domestic violence So she sees her experiences in the criminal justice system and when i challenge them I m essentially delegitimizing her experiences from her point of veiw When I have conversations with her about these things i try to avoid the subject because i know its something she went through But whenever i try to explain that I m not trying to minimise her experience by saying women also commit domestic violence she shuts down and refuses to talk I m kinda fine with this more or less because i know she s not trying to be rude or ignore me she just finds the conversation hard But for me it really sucks cause I m not trying to make my mum feel like any less of a victim but i don t see the harm in having more people know things about mra I also hate leaving things unsaid Like this is something in really believe in and we can disagree but i want to at least be able to have a conversation with my mum about this especially considering we never really talk about it as a family IDK maybe i brought it up in the wrong setting I just really want to have the conversation in general and i think it would be hard if every time I say something it comes off as I m either delegitimising her experiences or am just not listening

MensRights,1615483747,I don t know if you guys know but in the UK literally in the last few days a news headline has blow up over the disappearance and murder of a women named Sarah Everard The reason I bring this up is let s be honest if it was a man who disappeared or was murdered nobody would care and it wouldn t break local news let alone national news Not only that but it was apparently done by a male police officer and yet again the feminists are at it saying how women are too afraid to go out at night I saw one post on Twitter that was a rant about this and it got over    k likes with people agreeing women are being hurt Even tho men are the largest victims of violent crime Clearly this is discrimination Of course it s bad she was murdered no doubt by the bias and blaming of men is absurd   Link to article   
MensRights,1615481894,Can t help but laugh at the irony You preach that  no means no  but that didn t stop you from shoving your hands down my pants despite my protests You laughed as you took off your clothes and forced yourself on me You claim to have been too drunk to remember but I know you wouldn t accept that excuse from a man The crazy thing is I m on your side I consider myself a feminist I m a firm proponent of equal rights No woman should feel afraid for her safety when walking down the street at night In a way this has helped me understand your struggle even more That was the most powerless I have ever felt despite being strong enough to repeatedly push you off me But I let you escape with your dignity I didn t tell our friends what you had done It s a slap in the face for you to come out and post this when I know you don t uphold those values yourself  The thing about equality is it s a two way street Take a look in the mirror before you post something so hypocritical 
MensRights,1615475444,In the UK at the moment the disappearance of Sarah Everard has been a huge talking point This has led to discussions on twitter and other social media outlets over women s safety One of the most common points raised by women on this issue that I ve always struggled with is  Men need to hold other men accountable for their abusive behaviour and I ve never figured out what they mean by this and how to tackle this particular point Where have women gotten the idea that these awful rapists murderers and violent men are sharing the information of their crimes with their friends  If they have any the majority of the time the more serious ones are loners How can we convince women that we are just as clueless as to who in particular we need to be calling out The second dilemma I ve got is the safety at night thing All people  Particularly in a city should be wary at night I went to Uni in Southampton and I always made sure I was walking home with someone at night or on the phone to someone the whole way home I ve never thought it was a gendered issue it s just what I ve been raised to do to stay safe in fact it s what my Mother insisted I do I would really appreciate some insight or advice into this topic

MensRights,1615421687,  do you have the glasses from my last post keep them on    Heterosexual men always have and always will despise women      well uh thats a bold statement switch the genders and that sounds like what an incel would say  It is because they cannot both respect us and be sexually attracted to us those things are always mutually exclusive    you can respect someone and find them hot  Their brain just somehow functions so that what they re attracted to sexually always has to be less than    thats not how it works   nobody sees their significant other as less than or their suboordinate they see them as idk a   significant other     Heck the whole Madonna whore complex is a great example of this mindset As soon as a woman becomes something he might even respect a little bit  she s still just an object to him now gone from sexual to motherly  the sexual attraction disappears    we dont see you as objects you ve been on IncelsWithoutHate   you can be attracted to someone you respect  chances are if we dont like you we dont respect you no matter how highly you think of yourself you can be however attractive but with a personality like that we dont respect you if anything you re  objectified when we no longer respect you  we might not like your personality but we like your body  but if we respect you too thats not the case  If a man is sexually attracted to women he just simply cannot see us as actual human beings    we recognize you as actual human beings   like I know you re a real person behind Mutteriman   I dont think I d like you but I know you exist   and there are various girls who I ve been equals  even suboordinate  to and attracted to   both romantically and sexually     It has something to do with power just think about how much some many men hate homosexual men especially the ones who are more submissive and feminine    we dont hate gay people   we just don t respect those who dress as a clown   and before you call me out  I mean those who literally look like a clown   RuPaul is fine he s just looking feminine   but the netflix thumbnail for his show has a literal guy with the clown hair and the white powder and all that  They aren t  men anymore and hence not human To men a person cannot be respected if he she is in a receiving end sexually    to you maybe  What makes this all so sad is that women are not like that at all We ve loved men and women all over the world continue to love them in such an innocent and pure way We believe in romance and deep emotional connections We are capable of seeing them as more than just objects    bruh really insulted half the human race and explains how the other half is perfect  We can have male friends but  heterosexual men can not fathom the idea of being friends with women that would mean they d have to see us as actual human beings first    just because none of your male friends dont want to be around you doesnt mean they objectify you because you re female   I assure you its an attitude problem the same way how incels arent rejected cause they re short  misogyny is bad for getting girls  They always want to benefit somehow    sex isnt neccesarily a perk though  Some might argue that there are so many gold diggers and shallow women but it s really men who have made us that way We ve been taught to be dependent on men We ve been taught that only our looks and youth matter How can men complain about a system they created    you   literally have an entire guide  that states men will immediately leave you if you arent perfect     A LITERAL FDS HANDBOOK THAT SAYS THAT      AND IT USES THE SAME WORDS INCELS USE LIKE  a becky and  a chad I SWEAR  anyway have a good one edit but its not an actual edit was abt to submit and I got  your post needs flair  and I remembered to highlight a reply     you are making the problem      she is saying that if he wants to fuck its fine      and you are jumping and saying it means he disrespects her  wanting to have sex does not mean we cant respect you
MensRights,1615420268,    Context     the post in question in and of itself  dishonesty in a relationship is a reasonable issue   the response however is not     put on your glasses you ll need them   gt TLDR Being a working woman is the goal because if you have your own money you can leave SAHM is a precarious position and risky A HVM can turn low value after       or   years So you should always be financially stable of your own accord  okay this is literally saying you should be a career woman so you can leave marriage   right off the bat    gt Majority of women who stay in abusive relationships do so because they do not have the financial ability to support themselves alone especially if they have children Case in point above  alright this is true and to be fair thats a serious issue    gt There also doesn t even have to be abuse You could wake up one day and realize you have now become a  mommy bangmaid or just plain old realize this is not the life you desire and newsflash you need money to leave   he doesnt have to do anything you can decide that you re a mother who takes care of the house or realize you just dont like working and leave   this is literal irresponsibility and   exactly  what deadbeat dads do  they decide they dont wanna rise to being a father and just leave you cant just decide you dont want to be a mother and walk off    gt Some women on FDS say that if you want to be a SAHM you should have a rock solid prenup passive income before marriage have a stash sufficient for your possible escape    gt    gt Bullshit that is not enough    gt    gt Firstly that isn t even realistic for most women since majority of households in America need two incomes to survive In           of all household in America were  dual income      gt    gt Secondly a woman would need enough money to not just sustain her during a divorce but for a few years after Losing out on career advantages and progress derails financial stability She will need extra time to either go back to school or work her way up the ladder to a wage until she reaches a median salary for the country    gt    gt Not to mention no one wants to employ someone with a   year gap on their resume and if they do happen to get hired it s for well below the average salary It s been proven statistically that  divorced women are significantly poorer than their married counterparts   And while women s livelihood   decreases  after a divorce men s livelihood   increases  after a divorce    gt    gt Thirdly even a HVM is not going to sign a  rock hard prenup that will entitle his female partner to    of all assets But I ll bite Who s to say in the culmination of a divorce that he won t hide assets or properties What will you do if your HVM is no longer a HVM and pulls LVM moves A HVM can turn low value after       or   years The person you marry is not the same person you divorce true   you need money to leave  gt   Thirdly even a HVM is not going to sign a  rock hard prenup that will entitle his female partner to    of all assets  because its      this literally isnt even equality or maybe       since hes asking you to marry him this is outright stupid  gt Clearly being a stay at home mother isn t working out in our favor no matter how many women    desperately   want to stick to this traditional ideal  did someone say   our       again working as a class does not help individuals  individualism is why some are better off than others and you must accept that   gt The  only way this would work is    if you come from a well off family that provided you with a padded trust fund    you are highly educated in a lucrative easily employable career  doctor orthodontist optometrist etc  or    your husband gives you half of every paycheck    gt    gt If this isn t you don t be a SAHM if your parents give you money if you re a doctor or your husband gives you      off every dollar he makes otherwise dont be a stay at home mother   bRuH   alr rant complete
MensRights,1615412961,we all know how feminism wants to claim women are so  objectified and all that and they want to say men are privileged and it s a man s world stuff like that they will say they re objectified while we get drafted in wars because we are literally considered disposable and they ll say they re objectified after leaving a disaster first because of  women and children  since men are literally considered disposable they ll say we are privileged despite nothing being truly catered to us I get that feminism has some valid points as does  meninism  I mostly advocate for egalitarianism over feminism or  meninism but that s besides the point  point is everybody in society views men especially white men as  privileged scum pos  because society views us as so privileged they actively ignore anything truly wrong with how society treats us and hates us for being so  privileged when arguably women are more privileged imo but even then the whole concept of  privilege is silly I never have ever called someone  privileged and as a whole I dont think anybody is really truly  privileged in society unless you re a filthy rich corrupted elite  Anyway the only people who will care about you are other men men are supposed to be the care giver and anything that they deal with they re just told to man up or whatever you re expected to care for others when others arent expected to care for you even then most men wont care about you either most men only care about women either for relationship purposes or to try to get sex or whatever but really go around saying  I m a man and depressed or  my wife abused me  and see how little anybody cares  ever since I made close friends with my  bros I ve felt so much happier since I always had girl friends beforehand I never had to worry about if this new girl I met was trying to manipulate me into sex by saying she loved me and leaving after or how a girl friend is complaining about how privileged I am and how much she  hates all men  I just can play video games with my bros and it s a genuine experience not that I didnt hsve good experiences with girl friends but it s just such a different thing  bros better ourselves for each other because honestly  nobody else cares never had to worry about a friend of months years blocking me for having a different opinion when they all can just talk about it and even if they disagree it s fine because we are bros and we dont let that shit get to us it s just much more genuine 
MensRights,1615406981,How come women have a day AND a month for them but men only have a day and a month  for their healths  Isnt that a bit unfair 
MensRights,1615400894,I am aware of this sub s rule about mentioning activity in other sub reddits but what happened to me in another sub is a reflection of what is happening to me in real life too In a sub that discusses moral issues I posted my opinion about abortion My post was more in the form of a question as I am still unsure about how I feel about abortion I was immediately attacked by dozens of people and I was downvoted into oblivion I do not mind being downvoted as long as the person who downvotes me also explains why they disagree with me  But many people kept telling me that since I am a man I am not allowed to have an opinion about what  women do with their bodies  As always I was polite in my replies and I did not even react when insulted in the most vicious and personal way They went so far as to say that a fetus is just a parasite To my surprise a day later I was banned from the sub but I received a message from the moderators telling me that I had to apologise for being a bigot and for trolling I decided to humour them and I apologised They kept asking me to apologise again Eventually they told me to send them no more messages What is so shocking is that it has become acceptable for men to be denied from expressing their opinion let alone having a say in any action that involves women  In the case of abortion men should also have a say If a woman decides to abort a child I have had with her I think that my views should have some weight too 
MensRights,1615574854,Men have to serve  years mandatory in the Israeli military while women only have to serve  years This is neither fair nor right for women Either decrease the years of mandatory service for men or increase them for women Otherwise give women less rights in other areas if you are cutting male rights in military service Women can t say they want equal rights and then go back and defend policies like this 
MensRights,1615565312,I am currently writing a masters thesis on impulsivity and emotional regulation a process underlying practically all mental illness and I believe there are some important parallels to be drawn between these processes and the current climate of proposed female vulnerability that I think is worth sharing  It is first important to understand that we are machines constantly recognising environmental cues These cues e g the sound of running water or the smell of a fast food joint guide us toward beneficial resources such as food and water Furthermore cues such as the howl of a wolf guide us away from potential threats Our dopaminergic reward system plays a really important role in regulating our behaviour directed toward these cues Take the example of smelling the fast food joint the irresistible familiar smell guides you through the door and drives to purchase the divine greasy treat Subconsciously your brain has observed a cue and predicted a reward based on your previous behaviour toward the cue Due to your brain s correct prediction of the reward it releases a large amount of dopamine to help you remember your response  buying the burger is a beneficial reaction to the cue On the flipside not buying a burger is likely to make you a bit sad as your brain incorrectly predicted the response to the cue and less dopamine than expected is released  Impulsive disorders such as OCD substance and behavioural addictions all stem from maladaptive responses to cues In other words a cue may have a much more substantial effect on cognition than it deserves You can think of this as the snap of an opening can of lager to an alcoholic an otherwise normal cue that is now tied to intense craving of alcohol  What has this got to do with women and their perception of safety Well being the plastic malleable creatures we are our response to environmental cues can be learned from others Most of us know to steer clear of a rattle snake without having any prior experience of its bite This is the issue The continuous conversation about female safety has taught many young women to recognise men as a cue  especially in the presence of other cues such as the time of day that something horrible will happen to them This leads to maladaptive responses to the cue such as crossing the road calling a friend or getting in a taxi that results in you guessed it  Nothing The fact that nothing happens results in a nice dose of dopamine reaffirming their response to the cue no matter how unnecessary it was Why is this a problem Men are unfairly being associated with horrible people and are being mass generalised as such This is damaging not only for men but for the women who are conditioned into thinking that any man is after them The only way we can counter this is through education In a twist of narrative I believe it is now time not to have a conversation with your son about how to make women feel safe but to educate feminists and others  men and women alike who perpetuate a notion of constant murder and abuse toward women It was never men telling women to be vigilant dress a certain way or avoid the streets at night that fearmongering came from within the feminist community that constantly reduces women to nothing more than perpetual victims 
MensRights,1615561805,I have been seeing ALOT more of these on some girls I follow on Instagram adding to their story talking about how afraid they are of walking out at night because of men is there something that has happened because the amount more this has been showing up for the last day or two can t be a coincidence   
MensRights,1615560895,There s a new ad on the local radio that is advertising conjugal violence In it a men is saying that he has prepared her favorite meal after a week of going through her phone messages calling her names insulting her friends and so on Then at the end the announcer says  Report violence against women  I mean my wife does and says worst things to me on a daily basis Even my therapist told me recently that I m in an abusive relationship based on what I shared with her However if I was to report it it would probably back fire and I would be the one being scrutinized and punished  I m just tired of this inequality and I m scared about my son s future in this sick feminist world 
MensRights,1615559482,Metropolitan police had suggested women don t walk alone at night until the killer is found Your usual army of  activists have taken this as an attack on their rights and have replied with an barrage of abuse at men  Dangerous people exist I myself have been attacked walking home in the UK These killers and abusers aren t going to listen to someone saying  don t rape  The idea that they take advice of personal safety  respinsomsibility as an attack but then put the blame of one individual on  billion men is insane  Also on twitter a  CURFEW FOR MEN has been suggested amongst the usual of us having to cross the road when walking near them to ensure their optimal comfort These women hate men so much they would prefer men not to exist purely so they feel a smidgen safer when walking home 
MensRights,1615557091,I know there s some very anti female  anti feminist feelings in this sub and there s a lot going on to justify those sentiments But I moderate a new platform that s dedicated to TRADITIONALISM  ie The nuclear family   So what I m asking is what should I incorporate for men s issues   Should it be a section on feminist rhetoric hatred against men or just something to discuss the daily challenges men face in this age I m very much open to suggestions and truly appreciate the feedback 
MensRights,1615535675,I m curious to hear what other people here think about the new  TooManyWomen hashtag that s trending It seems that people have gotten sick of the  not all men responses that inevitably show up when women s issues are being discussed due to the inevitable  all men are dangerous type of language that tends to be used when sexual harrassment and rape are being discussed In order to avoid that they ve shifted to saying  too many women  as in too many women have been harrassed assaulted and raped Too many women face these problems on a regular basis for the problem to be ignored too many women get harrassed on a regular basis to stay silent about it At first glance it seems to be a great idea it addresses the real and serious problems that women face without condemning every man for it and should help the discussions not devolve into the usual men vs women arguments 
MensRights,1615532162,  Some quotes  Boys are more likely than girls to die in their second decade of life    But even more troubling Blum s team  found   that boys suffered higher levels of physical violence neglect and sexual abuse by adults than girls   In  one study   of       children age   and younger three quarters of the boys who reported being sexually victimized said the person who violated them was another child    In a little more than half those assaults the violator was a girl      The overwhelming majority of male rape victims say that the person who violated them was another male but    most male victims of other kinds of sexual violence say they were violated by a female      When we convey to boys that unwanted touch is a serious issue of sexual assault only when it affects girls and not when it affects boys we are sending a message that only girls bodies are worthy of protection   As the trial approached lawyers representing the school board asked the judge to prohibit Martin s legal team from using certain terms in front of a jury rape aggravated rape sexual battery sexual assault  Finally a real gem  Lara Stemple    told me that her efforts to bring attention to male victims  and to the surprisingly high rates of female perpetration of such violence  have at times triggered false accusations that she is aligned with men s rights activists who are known for anti feminist and misogynistic language and ideology  Even in an article about sexual violence against boys MRAs are  misogynists  God forbid aligning with them That s the Washington Post to you 
MensRights,1615513646,I think the original text was written by feminists demanding all men change their behaviour to suit their irrational feelz and fears but what shocks me is how bad things have gotten that seemingly sensible men are now so cowed and beaten over the head with feminist lies everyday that they too also believe we should have to behave differently in a discriminatory way just because of our gender Seems a sad number of men are now becoming the white knight propaganda filled self loathing cucks we knew feminism would make them 
MensRights,1615513107,Apologies for the mildly confrontational manor of this post but I used to be just like most of ya ll here Absolutely furious with the system s failure to protect me and the corrupt nature of it all But dam we got it so good here in America When you re locked in a cage with thousands of psychopaths for months on end you learn to not give one flying fuck about the small shit Humans are humans and there will always be unfortunate effects of our compromised nature on a societal basis There s no way around it Relish in the divinity of nature find a woman worth cherishing let go with some magic mushrooms and don t let the assholes distract you from the immense percentage of kind hearted folks out there Be the change you want be bitchin on Reddit won t do jack squat and inspire your comrades with action Have a great day 
MensRights,1615511728,I think it would be more accurate to say men AND women are responsible for shaping social norms Of course they re also subject to social norms which will affect their role in shaping them In times of societal change you will always find those who struggle with the new societal demands Here it seems that society is trying to shift away from sexism Consequently we re seeing a lot of people struggling with change Some object to this change and are frustrated to discover that rejecting emerging norms does not foreclose their effects So I think we re seeing attitudes and behaviors reflecting this frustration Frustration is understandable It s also confusing because the source is not always clear I sympathize with frustration but we can t lose sight of the real issue Is it reasonable for women to want a less sexist society and are women using reasonable means to pursue one Those who disagree with the first question will not accept any answer to the second one And I think this is how social change always leaves some people behind Those who simply cannot concede the reasonableness of pursuing social justice ultimately reject all methods of doing so But this doesn t prevent changes from affecting them so frustration naturally follows And though I sympathize with frustration that doesn t really change anything Pursuit of a reasonable and necessary social goal justifies the frustration it inevitably creates Would it really make sense to prioritize things the other way

MensRights,1615509550,I hate the idea that we live in a patriarchy and men have life so fine and dandy However i really struggle to find remember where the data is that shows things like suicide rate in men compared to women how men are more likely to get arrested and then get a longer sentence for committing the same crime how in the UK  i think a woman LEGALLY cannot rape a man  I am from the UK so if anyone has any good studies or articles about these points could you put them below  Thanks 
MensRights,1615652962,Not once have I ever seen any man  or any woman claim something to the effect of  She was wearing that revealing halter top therefore it serves her right that she got raped   Not one person  Ever  Yet I keep seeing this supposed rebuttal of  not asking for it    Granted my personal experiences are not the sum of all knowledge so I wanted to put this out there  Has anyone here ever actually encountered a person who has claimed that a woman deserved to get raped because of the clothes she was wearing or because she went to some party in a bad area of town or whatever  If there actually is someone making claims like that I m totally opposed to them of course  But I suspect this isn t a real thing but rather a straw man   However if you have encountered this type of attitude do speak up  I m curious 
MensRights,1615651618,I find this extremely bizzare because mensrights movement are not every one i know supports womens rights as much as mens I dont see mensright activists starting trends like KillAllMen TooManyMen CurvewForMen etc We seem to be more polite we seem to do more research and suggest actual changes we are not shouting how future is female we think future is all of us The fact that we point out equalaty problems men and boys face do not make us misogynists it means we are fighting for rights that belongs to everyone Feminists instead have only misandry towards men they dont even feel bad when little boys have tough times etc Mensrights movement seems to be the only movement who wants real equality not supermacy 
MensRights,1615646914,Anybody who s used tiktok will know what I m speaking of Lately I ve been seeing a lot of people generalise men with  We don t know which men are good which is why we say All men  and so many people are spreading statistics that at best are questionable This subreddit highlights a lot of big issues but I think we need to start doing more We should have a pinned thread dedicated to killing misinformation surrounding men and link changes that need to be made to fix many of the issues men face today  For example women can t be charged with rape in the UK women who force men to have sex with them aren t legally rapists family court issues paternity allowances the lack of support for male domestic violence victims the lack of funding towards suicide prevention for men the high rates of suicide amongst men amongst many other issues We need to combat the hate speech against men on whatever platform you see it on and the best way we can do that is with facts and statistics highlighting the issues and pointing out flaws in the arguments used to support the hate speech that is being said I highly doubt governments will talk about this evident issue so I think its important that we work to fix it ourselves Yes having a subreddit is good but we need to do more if we want a change  In Britain a petition with        signatures is brought before parliament If we could get even just  of these petitions to that number we will have done a lot for the cause

MensRights,1615640422,There seems to be bit of a misconception with this case being taken out of context  too seriously She has explained later that the proposal was not  entirely serious  more so suggesting is as a point of hypocrisy in victim blaming circles with ideas of  preventative measures where women have been advised to act on a sort of natural curfew themselves to keep them safe  This isn t some legitimate attempt to suppress men it s someone highlighting a presumed double standard a fear instilled curfew for women is tolerated but a curfew for men isn t Treating this seriously is counterproductive it would be much more helpful to focus on more genuine issues rather than let a non serious attempt to point out a double standard dominate the conversation  Using this point to devalue the current situation or as a demonstration of extreme views isn t effective there are many other better talking points you could use rather than recycling something people aren t taking seriously anyway
MensRights,1615639935,I feel like this is a very real topic because it s so called incel ideology People like to insult men for not having sex but it s actually risky to have sex nowadays for men because women can falsely accuse us of rape falsely claim that we got her pregnant or even falsely claim that we abuse them A lot of young men feel like losers because they are virgins because society acts like the more sex you have the better person you are  I m a virgin at   yo I would say I m a good guy but then I ll get labelled as a  nice guy but because I m shorter than  ft women don t care about me but it s okay I ll work on myself Retire early if I can I m not spending money that I can grow in the market on women using me or possibly exploiting me Anyways for any good guys out there when these women are    no kids divorced with kids they ll look for you Don t fall into the trap of raising kids that are not yours if women can pick their mates you can too just do it better

MensRights,1615600864,Apologies for posting a second time about the same article    But a comment to my previous post   Even the Washington Post admits female predation of boys and men  prompted me to quote the end of the last paragraph in full  I noticed my own knee jerk resistance to the reality that unwanted sexual contact can traumatize boys just as it does girls  and to the reality that it can  matter just as much to them Deep down somewhere under my skin I was holding on to some seriously wrongheaded assumptions  ideas so ingrained I did not even notice them ideas that rendered    boys as something less than human     Now if women like the author of this article are capable of  rendering boys     children     as subhuman then what do you think they think of men Less than dogs perhaps 
MensRights,1615599336,Interesting tidbit that got buried deep into page   of the report   gt While our initial analysis of overall rates of self reported harassment and assault behaviors showed that perpetration did not differ in statistically significant ways by the gender of the respondent this equivalence altered upon removal of the  sexist slurs item from our definition of harassment Upon removal of this variable we see a marginally statistically significant trend suggesting that men are more likely to engage in behaviors of sexual harassment and assault as compared to women     of men vs    of women p          It s interesting that they try to also cherry pick out the  sexist comments part so that they could twist the numbers against men However even with their cherrypicking they acknowledge a p value of       which as anyone who has ever taken a stats course could tell you means that the difference is not statistically significant with a standard significance level of      So in the end they failed to find that harassment and assault is a gendered offense in terms of perpetration  I have a feeling that this little hidden nugget of information won t be featured in any media articles or stopstreetharassment org articles anytime soon 
MensRights,1615596063,Today I decided as one of the complaints of us MRA s is a lack of shelters for men to lodge a Freedom of Information request with the Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government  The aim of this is to see if there is a disparity in funding using information readily available on the proportion of men to women living on the streets and creating a mean cost per man and woman on the street to decide if there is an existent disparity between funding provided for both  This is short as I have just lodged the request however we will be able to answer the question in at most   days time

MensRights,1615588842,But I wanted to say I am a huge supporter of this sub and of men s rights I ended up in a heated debate on Twitter with some so called  feminists today because of the recent murder in the UK and it solidified even more within me that men get such a bad rap for things that women are just as capable of Their responses were absolutely diabolical and when I pointed out the    rise in female paedophilia and examples of where women have been allowed to get away with things such as assault    times with no jail time   they had no response other than  But look how they treat us I won t tell you what my response to that was but it wasn t nice  I ve seen the damage women do to men firsthand Please know that there are women out there that see the raw deals you get and we support you 
MensRights,1615588813,Im trying to do some research due to the sudden surge of instagram attention on sexual harassment and i realised i have no idea where to look Most of what i search comes up with newspaper stories but i want to find actual statistics and case studies Any suggestion on how to effectively search for evidence 
MensRights,1615588598,This is just new theory I ve been thinking upon and wanted to get some feed back While we do have our extreme sexist people on both end of the spectrum my focus is on the people in the middle of the bell curve Most people in this group are they really sexist or are they selfish If their gender were all of a sudden changed would they still believing in the same things as they did before or would they switch sides to whatever that would serve their needs  amp be most beneficial to them  I started thinking more about this since I ve been seeing the  Notallmen tag  And I m a guy who had been harassed by females before but didn t really speak up on it because men just shrug it off  Quite recently I invited a girl over  amp she wanted to have sex I was into her but didn t feel like having sex so I made sure I was drunk that it was whiskey D She kept trying to push us to have sex the entire night and ran around flashing on me  amp doing things to provoke me I kept thinking that this is weird Switch roles I d be in trouble She apologized to me the next day The moral of the situations that I ve been in  amp  Notallmen is that  this is more of a power dynamic If women had the power they d be doing the same  amp I ve experienced this first hand I m not submissive guy at all but I ve been groped on first dates hit on my face on first dates  in a flirty manner but I don t like it  pressured for intercourse If women had more power and physical prowess we would see more of this across the board Which kind of brings back to my main point that this is more of a power dynamic to the vast majority of people  amp individuals being selfish Open to thoughts

MensRights,1615731321,I was getting back home from college in the metro and this group of people   women and  guy who was the cameraman walked in I was the nearest guy to the door so they came up to me with a mic and asked me my name and how old I was etc etc I did not expect what was coming up so I just played along  Few questions in and she asks me what my sexual orientation is So I replied I m a straight male and this person looked at the camera and gave a disgusted look and laughed That threw me off a little but I let it slide  Then she asked me if I had a girlfriend to which I replied yes  Then comes the weird part She asks me  did you ever hit her  What the actual fuck I replied  No I have never hit her and I never will  So she went on to ask  have you ever thought of hitting her  This is where I decided to draw the line so I replied  no and I m not going to reply to anymore of your absurd questions so please leave me alone  They still didn t stop and started saying stuff like  that s what someone who hits women would say  and  are you a predator in your free time  I told them I wasn t comfortable being filmed so they should leave me alone They still didn t stop They started saying  this is exactly why we call men pigs and other similar stuff Then she ended the video and the whole tone just changed She became completely polite and said  we re just filming a feminist video for our project Sorry if you felt harrassed or anything like that  Then she said  don t worry I ll blur your face no one will recognize you  as they fucking sprinted out of the train when the doors opened I don t want to play the victim card but I deal with a lot of mental health issues  self harm anorexia ADHD and severe anxiety and they ve just made my day so much worse That too just when I was starting to feel a little better 
MensRights,1615723942,Has anyone else noticed how in public places like malls restaurants gyms schools etc the janitor is      of the time female Especially during open hours I ve noticed it in too many places now for this to seem coincidental For example even at my workplace I never once seen a Male janitor work in open hours but I have seen them come after the place closes for night shifts During the day it s always been women These female janitors clean the bathrooms periodically and often times come in while we are taking a leak at the urinal as well and no one says anything to them I ve seen this happen even at my high school It s really sexist that people view all males as pervs who should never clean womans bathroom unless guaranteed there will be no one there but don t care about women janitors cleaning our bathroom even with people inside smh 
MensRights,1615723095,So I saw a twitter post today with a few thousand likes and it was talking about how Gay men are included when women say   we don t feel safe around men  The OP then went on to reference her being harassed by gay men  which is valid and is an issue that should be talked about   However she then went on to say that gay men still have male privilege and well   um   Let me just quote it  Y all have still grown up with male privilege you ve been socialised to believe you re more important and have more power than us and that doesn t go away because you suck dick lol  Now I would really like you to tell me how I a gay guy was socialised to believe I m more important than women Was it the feeling of estrangement in school cause I grew up feeling isolated from everyone cause I was  weird and different    Was it me thinking there was something wrong with me Oh no it was definitely having no male friends right I think it shows that people will bring  male privilege into an argument to make them sound like they re being reasonable but they re not when they clearly haven t thought about who actually has the privilege The only people with male privilege are the privileged Joe from down the street who s a plumber isn t privileged The CEO of a company is actually privileged Rich privileged people have the upper hand in society they have influence your average dad doesn t  This is my first post here so it s probably not well thought out or anything I just felt confused as to why someone would make a post that was causing man hating against the people who are meant to be your allies Also many gay men in the comments spoke about their experiences with being harassed by straight women and guess what They got attacked dismissed and hated on How can one claim men are privileged and then go on to dismiss someone s harassment purely based on the fact he s a man 
MensRights,1615722962,Her death is tragic goes without saying murders are tragic Why do people find it necessary to express this with the additional attack on men I ve seen so many people on Reddit in the media and other social media platforms go from woman was kidnapped and murdered to all men are dangerous teach men not to        yes all men and now the police are sexist  I just can t get my head around it and I feel so alone in my opinions I m starting to lose the plot a bit And when I see seemingly pleasant posts paying respect for her with that dig at men attached all I feel is that whoever shared it is virtue signalling and totally insincere Whenever I see people mention how many men kill women about sexism in the police I want to explain that more men are victims of violence from strangers and that the criminal system is hugely skewered in favour of women not against them Not that sentencing is the same as policing but you get my point I don t comment this stuff out of respect for the lady who was killed but these narratives are being perpetuated so much at least in the UK Why is it okay for men to be vilified in such broad terms and it be the popular opinion

MensRights,1615692957,Back in the early      s there was an independent film called   A Day Without A Mexican    a comedy about what would happen to the world if all the Mexican s suddenly disappeared off the face of the earth and the repercussions it caused With everything currently going on in the world surrounding men especially in the UK and how women are deciding that we re all evil I propose a worldwide event where all men just stop for      We don t go to work we stop helping women in all aspects of life Broken internet lady sorry we can t help you with that Need your tire changed lady sorry we can t help you with that either Could you imagine if all men around the world suddenly just stopped contributing to society and making sure the lights stayed on for an entire   hours The world would fall apart And since women hate us for even being born this is their time to shine and do everything they claim they can do and how they don t need us for anything I know this proposal is a long shot but I m getting really sick and tired being called a piece of shit because I was born with a penis Enough is enough already 
MensRights,1615692675, I am unsure if this is the proper tag but if it is not then I am sorry and would hope that the admins correct me instead of deleting my post So I saw a new post from TheTinMen and it got me thinking about the tragic case of Emmett Till What if feminism is in some ways another lever that can be or is used to reinforce white supremacy systemic racism and police brutality  Think about it By breeding distrust of men and avoidance of them you create or influence stereotypes that they are dangerous If you create that stereotype of dangerous men you potentially create a criminal bias against them especially towards men of color This bias impacts average people law enforcement and the courts who will treat false allegations as truth and proceed accordingly After all that s essentially what happened to Emmett Till He was falsely accused by a woman and the men who murdered him got off because they believed they were serving justice to a  perpetrator  We see this now with the curfew in the UK false rape allegations on college campuses and so on Apologies if this came off as incoherent Just figured I d create some discussion on the topic and wanted to see if I m wrong because I feel like I m not 
MensRights,1615692592,When people hear I m a MRA people think that Means I am a racist sexist bigoted and incel I don t believe that to be true for me or for anyone here What I think MRA means is calling out what feminists believe to be true and to call out the bad things that they do in the guise of  social justice   The reason I joined MRA was because I began to understand the harm that feminism is doing on young boys and how it is just wrong that men are being treated unfairly in family court school and society in general I came to this realization in high school when I had a teacher give all of her attention to the girls in the class to help them succeed and punish the boys with extra homework and an unfair grading standard I didn t realize at first but later in the term I figured it out as it seemed that we had to do more work for no extra reward and it just seemed weird that my female classmates loved her but my male classmates and I absolutely HATED her It came down to her projecting her home life on the students I am now almost out of college so it was a long time since then but I still remember it like it was yesterday  It is just shitty that women are allowed and encouraged to be sexist and racist and just down right psycho but if a man does any of that it is a crime in the public court I just love reading tweets calling to  kill all men or to  teach men to be better  If I replaced man with woman I would be dragged all over the internet and my life would be absolutely ruined I have seen it happen with many people even men I know For example a friend let s call him John went to a party with some really popular girls and proceeded to hook up with one of them will call Jane After the party Jane regretted sleeping with him and wished she didn t Her friends told her that she could claim it was rape and encouraged her to report him to the school Luckily for John she never went through with it as she knew that it was consensual She told that to her friends and they said that if she didn t report him they would First of all it is extremely inappropriate to tell someone what they want when it isn t even true So the friend who will call Amy told the school that John raped her friend Jane and she wanted to tell you but felt she couldn t Again John got lucky that Jane told the school and the police that she didn t say that and that John didn t rape her and it was consensual Why do I mention this Because it is just one of the many ways that feminists hurt us guys and that it would be so wrong for a man to do  I simply don t understand how people think that it is ok to be sexist to men and racist towards white people as if reverse racism isn t real It just sickens me to see society turn its back towards men Judge not by the sex of the person but by the content of their character

MensRights,1615670935,I wanted to share this story I created a throwaway account because I don t trust putting this on my main account I live in the U K where in the news there s been stories of the tragic murder of a woman  Anyway my girlfriend who lives with me ordered some baking supplies from a local shop as she was making a cake for Mother s Day for her mum in our coronavirus bubble she asked me to pick them up this evening I got in my car to the bakers shop to pick up the yeast and some fresh flour and pay for them Inside the bakers shop was two women who work there it was dark outside at this time I enter the shop and said I came to pick up an order for my GF placed One of the women looked at me and spoke to the other women and whispered one of the women went out the back and I was expecting her to bring the stuff we ordered so I could pay and leave  But I was kinda shocked when the other woman told me that she wouldn t serve me as her friend who was now at the back of the shop didn t feel comfortable with me there due to my  over bearing masculine presence and said they d call the police if I didn t leave I respected their decision and left as I was more afraid at this point they may make up I did something when I never I have no idea what I did wrong I m a rather tall and fat male but I did nothing to make them feel unsafe at all My girlfriend was furious and called the owner as she knows them  a couple who deeply apologised and said the younger girl was new and with everything going on in the news it s to be expected  I guess no harm done but this is the first and hopefully last time I was refused service because I presume of my gender My girlfriend is still furious Edit for anyone wondering I went to Morrison s instead and the lovely baker guy there gave me some fresh yeast for free and bought some flour

MensRights,1615661392,tl dr Against popular opinion men more likely to be killed walking down the street men get sexually harassed too many posts on social media in the UK atm is a false and dangerous narrative calling for curfews for men and for men to  teach their sons yet this is baseless slander  amp  x   B Recently a woman by the name of Sarah Everard went missing a week later her body was found and a UK Policeman has been arrested for her murder This is a horrible situation and I hope the guy who did it rots in jail Following this there has been a massive campaign over social media and the media claiming statistics such as    of women have been sexually harassed and that there should be a curfew for men and that men need to teach their sons This was quite a lot to take in and at first I was just going to just get on with my day but since some friends asked my opinion I decided to look into it a bit Firstly it should be understood that statistics can be easily twisted to argue any point so take everything including what I have said with a pinch of salt investigate things for yourself and make your own opinions Where I have used data it is from the  Office for National Statistics   by the UK government which has data about murder over the last   years I used data for the year        chosen by random however while researching I realised I could choose data from        which would support my arguments even better but decided against it as I don t want to cherry pick data like other groups do For instance  Femicide Census   report that    of women are killed by men are from a current or former partner as it fits their narrative at that moment Recently women are now claiming that they are killed mainly while walking down the street by random men So which is true Through the data it says that women killed by a current or former partner are around     That is quite a significant difference to a point where I can t even explain how they got that number Have you heard about Kieran Campbell He is a    year old boy and he went missing the same day as Sarah   rd March and thankfully was found  days later however in all that time I saw nothing from social media or the media except for this  News Story   which contains more information about Sarah s disappearance yet in no news story on Sarah have I seen information about Kieran Why the difference Looking more into the stats I found      men killed    women killed      of which for men killed    from someone they didn t know      of which for women killed    from someone they didn t know      So women saying they re killed by random men just for simply walking down the street is a lot less likely than they are implying it is far more likely they know the guy AND it is more likely men get killed for walking down the street by someone random   Looking at where people have been killed residential vs public places in percentage Male      Women           Therefore men are far more likely than women to be killed on the street      Women are much more likely to be killed in a home than in a public place  just walking down the street which is against their current narrative   A bit off the topic but for the suspects of these murders      Female suspects are more likely to NOT be convicted of murder    of women aren t convicted of murder whereas    of men aren t convicted      Of those convicted    of men get life imprisonment whereas only    of women get life imprisonment for their murder      So basically women are REALLY unlikely to be killed by a stranger on the street yet men are more likely and spoke about less Enough of statistics let s just use some good old logic   There has been a call for men to be given a curfew of  pm to  protect women      The thing is if you single out one group and give them a curfew that is quite horrific but you can say it about men A good tool I use is can you change gender for another identifier will it still be okay to say Think race LGBTQ etc      Think about the number of people men save men are the massive majority of jobs working for public protection think police fire army etc   The    experience some kind of sexual harassment         I m not going to invalidate someone s personal experience although many posts on social media claiming that men do not experience sexual harassment is invalidating our experiences   ironic right      I find that stat quite insane I can t tell if it s accurate or not but I do have important questions         What counts as sexual harassment I ve heard some people say  being stared at by a male counts More often than not the dude was probably just daydreaming on the bus         How did they get this data did they interview random women on the street      I think that men also get sexually assaulted quite a lot but don t realise it Think about a man flashing a woman that s sexual assault Now a woman flashing a man will he if interviewed say he was sexually assaulted Me personally I have been touched inappropriately by women on multiple occasions non consensually  grabbing my butt and rolling their hand up to my inner thigh and I also been cat called  which was odd but I never really thought I has been sexually assaulted until I considered it the other way round So I wonder what  of men have been sexually assaulted And if so I don t think we should be teaching boys to not sexually harass women we should be teaching our children to understand boundaries and respect everyone    Teach sons to respect women    So this is going to be quite controversial But boys raised by singles mothers tend to be more likely to grow up and commit crime including harassing women So surely women aren t even teaching their sons And moreover can be inferred that men ARE teaching their sons and women are not Now this is maybe a bit too much of a blanket statement I believe anyone raised in a single parent household can grow up and do amazing things and won t become criminals but I think it is something worse considering   Commonly we are told that men are normalising rape due to making rape jokes I thought about this I have not ever heard a rape joke about women and only ever heard about rape jokes about men dropping the soap in the prison shower So I decided to search  rape joke on YouTube and what I found was many many videos of women making some kind of speech saying rape jokes are bad a video of a man affected by prison rape jokes as he had experienced it a comedian making jokes about how saying jokes about rape are taboo and an American Dad clip which did contain a rape joke I decided to take this further and asked people to  tell me a rape joke  no one I have asked can think of one except for the prison shower one   so please tell me a rape joke because I don t know if it is a thing So all in all what s going on right now on social media is perplexing But here s the great thing about social media you can turn it off For those who feel a bit upset that there is a massive smearing campaign against men please I urge you to forget about it as it is not going to affect your life at all once you just close the app Focus on your professional career and what makes you happy You are all kings and deserve happiness 
MensRights,1615657644, I appreciate any views on this but mostly I just want to open my mouth and complain about this situation and spread the word that this kind of misandry exists tl dr GF s friend is complaining about men all the time and tries to manipulate her into breaking up with me as she hates me too GF doesn t want to lose the others in the friend group but I don t like the idea of her hanging out with this toxic idiot My girlfriend has two social circles other one being her friends from uni One of her friends is really radical feminist a lesbian and someone who proudly tells people  she has no men in her life  other than her dad    Red flag   Well first I saw no problem in this everyone has the freedom to an opinion But now that I know the way she talks My GF and her friends have been meeting in our aparment for some time now and I have to listen to them At first I was happy cause I wanted to meet new people Lately I have been distancing myself from them for a reason This one girl complains about men  and straight people literally  all the fucking time  If they are watching TV  who there s so many men in this series   that male character is stupid  If they re talking about studies  this male professor is really racist and sexist and  If they re talking about politics or feminism  fuck all men   are you implying that men matter   ironic joke or is it    men are rapist pigs  I know she has asked the lecturer if she can change groups because she doesn t want to work with men ofc she worded it in a way that it s  men who are always harassing her She has also demanded that her essays must be double checked if the professor is a male Great  I have also heard her complaining about me she probably didn t realize I was home lol Apparently I m  mansplaining if I discuss things with them  even tho I mostly agree with them on many issues  I don t understand the world can t handle emotions  what     and I listen to  mens fantasy music full of rape and whores  she went thru my vinyl collection lol  Of course I have been furious at my GF for allowing her to talk like that in our home My GF told me she has also suggested breaking up with me  for no reason   and that my GF should take precautions because I might hurt her or rape her Nice Apparently this woman is a central person in this social circle and my GF is afraid to talk about this issue The others in this group are not as radical most of them being quite  normal people I would say My GF ofc wants to keep these friends as she doesn t want to study alone She also fears that she might become a target for bullying or something for example they already know shes not as left wing as they are and she gets some shit for this   My feelings   to put it shortly I don t want my partner to hang around toxic people who want to manipulate them and who apparently hate me for being a male We re afraid that if she doesn t want to be with them anymore they will accuse me of being a manipulator or something or accuse her of something else

MensRights,1615803516,Previously I posted   gt  It hurts i m just tired of it all I want to hug my mom     I was having an anxiety attack Thankfully talking to a friend actually helped     Why   I didn t know why but I was feeling very attacked by all these posts surrounding the tragic death of Sarah Evarard I sat in the shower for two hours and was recollecting my thoughts I decided to call a friend and while trying to talk I just burst out crying I realized that I felt like I was once again living in the moment I was  falsely accused  It felt like my victim hood was being stripped away because I was a man  I may have been oversensitive about it flame me or whatever  The only reason why after a whole year I could talk to women again is because another individual told me  not all woman are monsters and that was the self realization that my generalization of individuals to their group identity was dangerous    But this isn t about you   It really isn t I m glad that a lot of woman are sharing their experiences and shedding a new light on what they had to experience on a daily basis While I knew it was an issue I didn t think the scale of it would be this large So I do agree that women face the adversary of needing to be worried walking alone in the streets and it is a fair assumption for them to think the man behind her is a perpetrator  And yet I felt alienated unwanted and once again I found myself fearing women So I decided to look at it more constructively The conversation is about the struggle of being a woman needing to take more taxi rides than required   It is a real issue   But does generalizing men comparing us to ticks and even setting rules not set a negative tone towards men It feels more like  men are the issue than any solution really    I m no expert in stats  I don t care really While most post seem to always try to cater to stats towards making one community oppressed I am certain of one thing and that is my group identity does not define who tf I am    What s next   Next step for a solution to the issue is  What can we as every individual him her itself can do  rather than  What men should do because I really don t think that pushes the conversation forward  What do you guys think 
MensRights,1615803146,I understand this may not be directly linked to Mens Rights but I thought I d share it here in case anyone feels like using it So a lot of people know that radical femenists like to spread the lie that  Women earn    less than men for the same job  or some percentage of wage indifference However I thought of an argument which  should shut down a lot of liars Here s my example  Jim works in an office He earns some amount of money a year from his boss One day Jim decides that he wants to become transgender so he goes to the hospital and has the surgery Now Jim is sexually identified as a woman and goes by the name Lauren The next day Lauren goes back to  her job in the office  Now under the equal employment act Lauren s boss cannot change  her pay even if they have decided to change a part of their body  Lauren goes to her desk when the boss walks over   Sorry Lauren but you re a woman now That means I have to pay you    less of your wages I know you understand  Now here s the argument  Would that scenario ever happen in real life Lauren is a woman which means she  should be paid    less but that exchange between Lauren and  her boss would never happen because it s illogical So for that reason it proves that woman aren t paid less for the same job as that conversation would never take place

MensRights,1615769074, I just got censored for the first time I posted my men s rights view on a literal debate thread where we were supposed to debate I argued that the wage gap isn t bad and only exists because of personal choice the higher competitiveness of men and the distribution of intelligence  men are more likely to be really dumb or really smart while women are more average  However a couple days letter out of nowhere I was permanently banned I had a lengthy proper debate with others  no insults and even managed to change some views so I don t understand why I was banned My only guess was that maybe liberal woman decided to ban me for espousing that view and  offending her and didn t have the guts to debate me instead Or perhaps a male social justice warrior decided that they didn t want me on that subreddit because my views didn t align with theirs I asked multiple times why I was banned but it seems that the moderators have completely ghosted me and aren t responding 
MensRights,1615761176,Not sure if this has been seen outside of the UK but the news recently has been of  a man who killed a woman    Lots of vigils were held over the weekend  some being broken up by police   as we are currently in a national lockdown and large groups of people cannot gather This has been hailed as  police not protecting women and there is a lot of talk about there being too many women being killed by men and  women matter less than cars   and no one is talking about men I did a little research on the  Office for National Statistics   website and saw a very different picture  The increase in homicide between the year ending March     and year ending March     reflected a    rise in the number of male victims which increased from    in the year ending March     to    in the year ending March      Over the same period the number of female victims increased from    to        increase   A little more reading supports the idea that more men than women are victims of homicide in the UK  In the latest year there has been a    increase in the number of male victims     to      Conversely the number of female victims fell by     from    to      the first decrease since year ending March      Why is it that only women are being talked about It wouldn t make sense if the ratio of male and female victims was    to only talk about women but it s not it s worse for men 
MensRights,1615759992, Source   Yet another unnecessary false rape case suicide in India Yet another man lost a life because men aretreated like shit in this shit hole of a nation A nation where men are not allowed to speak about harassment and abuse by law Only chance they get to speak is in suicide notes when it s too late Feminists claim false accusations are an  inconvenience for men It has been proven time and again that number of false accusations is higher than the number of proven rape cases It has been proven that a mere accusation can ruin a mans life Not only ruin it can lead to suicide Yet the issue is  very minor according to feminists and should be ignored It was in     that the Indian government had decided to setup gender neutral laws when it comes to rape and harassment complaints but feminist organisations protested against it and we still have laws that state only men can rape only men can be sexual assaulters This is also coming during the time when the High Court of Delhi said   Fake cases of sexual harassment a trend    THIS IS WHAT REAL SYSTEMIC OPPRESSION LOOKS LIKE When will the world start taking the pain and issues of men seriously When will world realise they have been fooled by the farce called feminism 
MensRights,1615759669,As we all know feminism is a huge obstacle standing in the way of our goal Even when we underline the difference between disliking women s rights and disliking feminism and that we re fully in support of the former people still seem to call us misogynists They use these strange confusing arguments that would boggle the mind and if you aren t an men s rights hero you most likely wouldn t be able to defeat them I feel that if we would be able to conquer them and get our point through to the other side we d be golden So post any and all of these arguments that may come to mind in the comments below so that people who haven t heard that one before won t be caught off guard if it comes up Together we can break through the jail we reside in

MensRights,1615755983,I joined this sub reddit because I wanted to understand the problems and hardships men face in day to day life yet all I see in here is people complaing at  feminatzis and thats about it Nothing about suicide rape attacks unfair jail times Nothing about charities to support that help men Nothing that will acturally help and make a difference All this group is is a bunch of people spreading hate   How sad 
MensRights,1615751910,Years ago in school I fell Victim to a false accusation   I m    and I still remember it   Here s what happened I was called to the Principal s Office so I went Get this a girl pointed at me  Pretty much and claimed I touched her in her rear end   She claimed I did it on the bus the day prior and I got in trouble So when I got home I told my mom She was mad when I told her so she called the Super Intendent The next day of course another thing of it happened They punished me for a thing I didn t do  What it was is what this is about  and get this After Recess was over they apologized as if they just wanted to punish me for something I didn t do   And guess what The girl was NEVER punished   This happened way back in Elementary School To think they d actually punish a kid for something with no evidence of   
MensRights,1615751491,A manchild is essentially a man with means  or who has the potential to earn a decent living who focuses on himself instead of on women and starting a family  Such a man is seen as selfish and immature  And this is because the default expectation is that he should settle down get married and have children  His money isn t seen as belonging to him and his happiness isn t taken as a priority  People instead think about all the women out there who could take his money and spend it on themselves and their happiness But can t because he s too busy spending it on things he wants to do According to at least one article about this some of the signs of a manchild include   Talk of children or commitment brings panic to his eyes    He avoids serious conversation meaning he changes the topic when you try to convince him to marry you or have kids with him   His interests and friendships carry a middle school vibe  In other words he likes to have fun instead of getting serious about that marriage and children thing everyone wants him to do The default gynocentric view is that this is harmful to women  That these men who are living their lives for themselves and not for women and children are doing something wrong  And the articles you see about this definitely take that approach  The message is that a proper mature man does everything he can for women  Including handing over his money so she can live in a big house possibly have kids with him and then not have to work a job anymore Society condemns and criticizes men who don t do this which I don t think is fair  If women are strong and independent then we shouldn t be shaming men into being providers and  good husbands for them  Let him have his hobbies and spend his money how he deems appropriate  His time money and energy do not belong to women  And if you want to talk about being selfish that expectation itself is what s selfish

MensRights,1615749270,In the light of the suggestion from a left wing lord in the UK that men should be curfewed from  pm  she said she was joking but       i have seen the following comment on female sites being posted by female relatives  We know its not all MEN but we dont know which MEN so we are wary of all MEN   My response has been would this be an acceptable post if you replaced the word MEN with the word Muslim   Personally i find xenophobia and racism abhorrent  Of course the response is that would be disgusting you cant judge a religion by the actions of a few  And yet they refuse to accept their original comment is equally unacceptable in blaming all men for the actions of a few  These type of left wing agitators jump on the latest trend and use it to cause unrest and division and it seems that s all they exist for  The only real result is too push right wing agitators further right leaving the  sensible middle surrounded on both sides by idiots  I find it very difficult to support a cause which tells you that if you re not part of the solution you re part of the problem 
MensRights,1615747812,Trying to not be long winded here but this is bugging me to no end    One regular argument we hear from feminists and women s rights activists is how women must fear being raped by a random man on the street  Our typical reply is along the lines of men are  times more likely to be violently assaulted including murder more so by a stranger  Which is imperially true So this extremely sad and unfortunate murder of Sarah Everard is showing the true colors of feminism what happened to her IS A MALE ISSUE  She was murdered not raped or kidnapped she was murdered the very thing we as men show is a real problem for us at triple the rate of women  So a male victim dominated crime happens to a women and it s all about women  The issue murder has been hijacked and turned political This is something we can not let happen or allow the opposite to happen either when something exceptional happens to us  We must speak up and point out this victim championing  The media is not helping of course and we can t really contact them so it s important we point out what happened to Sarah is the very thing we men are expressing we have to worry about being murdered at triple the rate   The women s right movement is taking something that is a primary male issue to the degree of triple the rate and taking a single instance and claiming the entire problem is not only theirs but using it to place blame  This is not productive for them or us it helps no one because it s changing the narrative of who the victims  usually are which takes focus off a problem and shifts it to a smaller one Please speak up  Please make note this is the exact issue we are bringing up when women bring up walking down the street in fear of rape men have to worry about exactly what happened to Sarah and it falls on deaf ears regularly  Use this as an example of something that happens to men more than women women are not excluded from it Sarah Everard is your example and express how there are issues that happen to women more than men but do still happen to men We need to take the high road here and use Sarah Everard s untimely death as something for progress positivity and unity instead of adding fuel to the hate and blame fire with silly arguments and being defensive  Let s be positive and use this as a mutual point to talk not a contentios point to argue 
MensRights,1615741535,There have already been a few posts about the Sarah Everard case and the misandrist ripple effects it has created but this is one I haven t heard talked about much There is a lot of talk about making misogyny a hate crime as part the newly devised  Police Crime Sentencing and Courts Bill  But this amendment excludes prejudice against men To me this implies that sexism is worse towards women than it is men because   Oh wait   It isn t  Odd concept of gender equality  Thoughts

MensRights,1615740183,Regardless of your opinions on him as a politician or the nursing home stuff what s happening to him is terrible He kisses someone while greeting them because you know he has decent manners yet that s sexual harassment He hugs someone and accidentally touches their shoulder and it s inappropriate touching Since when was greeting someone with physical touch sexual harassment The investigation has barely begun and people are already calling for his resignation without any evidence besides a women s word and a picture of him kissing a women which he does whenever he greets someone As with any allegation they are just allegations Don t pass judgement on someone until the facts are out or else you endanger ruining someone s career for no reason If you don t like Cuomo because of his political beliefs that s fine If you don t like him because of the nursing home stuff that s also fine But not this  Metoo cancel culture bullshit Evidence matters It s about damn time feminists realize that before they try to ruin every successful mans career I don t wanna grow up in a world where all my life s accomplishments can be wiped out because one women can so easily accuse me of something and oust me without due process Men are in danger of losing basic due process and the Cuomo stuff is a perfect example
